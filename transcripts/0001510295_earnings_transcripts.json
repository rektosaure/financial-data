My name is Shirley, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning. I'd like to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan. At the end of the year, Mike will be stepping down as Executive Chairman. Mike's guidance has been tremendously valuable to our Board, to me and our entire leadership team. We thank him for his service as well as all of his contributions. He will be missed.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered strong cash generation of $2.4 billion. Utilization in the quarter was 95% as we executed our planned refinery turnarounds safely and on time. Our team delivered 96% capture despite significant market-driven headwinds. Year-to-date, capture is 102%. This compares to the prior year's level of 95%. We believe this demonstrates our commitment to deliver sustainable, improving commercial performance in varying market conditions. We have generated $6 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital and have returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through the third quarter. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to MPC's dividend, reflecting our confidence in our business outlook. We believe that we should be able to lead in cash generation through cycle delivering peer-leading results.\nIn October, our blended crack was over $15 per barrel, which is seasonally strong and more than $5 per barrel or 50% higher than the same time period last year. Diesel and jet demand are up modestly across our system, while gasoline is flat to slightly lower. The product inventory draws reported last week signaled strong demand. Gasoline and distillate inventory levels remain below 5-year averages. Current market fundamentals are indicative of tightness in supply and supportive demand, which we believe will persist into 2026.\nThroughout the quarter, we completed several transactions advancing our strategic objectives and optimizing our portfolio. We sold our interest in an ethanol production joint venture. As the partner's strategic goals evolved and diverged, an opportunity came for MPC to exit the partnership at a compelling multiple, MPLX acquired a Delaware Basin sour gas treating business and the remaining 55% interest in the BANGL pipeline, these transactions further MPLX's growth profile. MPLX increased its distribution this quarter reflecting conviction in its growth outlook, we now expect to receive $2.8 billion annually from MPLX. MPLX continues to target a distribution growth rate of 12.5% over the next couple of years which would imply annual cash distributions to MPC of over $3.5 billion.\nWe are driving value and positioning MPC to be industry-leading in its own capital return program. With our competitive, integrated, refining and marketing value chains and durable midstream growth driving increasing distributions from MPLX, we believe MPC is positioned to deliver industry-leading cash generation through all parts of the cycle.\nNow I'll hand it over to John to discuss our financial performance.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Moving to third quarter highlights. Slide 4 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted net income of $3.01 per share. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations excluding changes in working capital. MPC returned over $900 million to capital -- of capital to shareholders in the quarter with repurchases of $650 million and dividends of $276 million.\nSlide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter to third quarter and the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and our net results for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion was largely in line with the prior quarter.\nR&M segment results on Slide 6 were strong with adjusted EBITDA of $6.37 per barrel. Our refineries ran at 95% utilization, processing 2.8 million barrels of crude per day. And several of our refineries achieved monthly throughput records in the quarter, including Robinson and Detroit in the Mid-Con and Anacortes in the West Coast. Mid-Con margin strengthened sequentially and but were offset by declining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the West Coast.\nTurning to Slide 7. Third quarter capture was 96% with headwinds in the West Coast and the Gulf Coast. Jet to diesel differentials compressed. We faced lower clean product margins and inventory changes contributed headwinds to capture. The downtime of our Galveston Bay refinery resid hydrocracker was also a headwind to capture of almost 2% across the whole system with a larger effect on our Gulf Coast results.\nSlide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year. MPLX is executing its growth strategy targeting its natural gas and NGL value chains and remains a source of durable cash flow growth for MPC.\nSlide 9 shows our renewable diesel segment performance for the quarter. Our renewable diesel facilities operated at 86% utilization, reflecting improved operational reliability. Margins were weaker in the third quarter as higher diesel prices and RIN values were more than offset by higher feedstock costs. We will continue to optimize our renewable operations, leveraging their logistics and pretreatment capabilities.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.4 billion. And in the third quarter, MPLX completed acquisitions of over $3 billion and issued debt in connection with those acquisitions to finance them. Also, as we discussed with you last quarter, our second quarter share repurchases were influenced by the anticipated proceeds from the sale of our interest in the ethanol joint venture, which closed in July. At the end of the quarter, MPC had cash of nearly $900 million and MPLX had cash of approximately $1.8 billion.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our fourth quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. The Galveston Bay resid hydrocracker is expected to be at full operating capacity before the end of the month enabling optimization of our Gulf Coast system. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $420 million in the fourth quarter, with activity mainly focused in the West Coast.\nWe are completing our multiyear infrastructure improvement project at our Los Angeles refinery in the fourth quarter, with start-up scheduled to align with the conclusion of planned turnaround work before the end of this month. These improvements are intended to strengthen the competitiveness of our Los Angeles refinery and position us to remain one of the most cost competitive players in the region for years to come. Operating costs for the fourth quarter are projected to be $5.80 per barrel. Distribution costs are projected to be approximately $1.6 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $240 million.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, John. We delivered a strong quarter in Refining & Marketing. Safe and reliable operations are foundational. Operational excellence is integral. The commercial team is optimizing decision making as we leverage our value chains and capture opportunities the market presents. We are optimizing our portfolio through strategic investments. Fourth quarter refining cracks have started out stronger than seasonal averages. Current fundamentals highlight the market tightness and support our enhanced mid-cycle outlook into 2026. Our integrated value chains and geographically diversified assets position us to lead in capital allocation, and offer a compelling value proposition to our shareholders.\nLet me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. As we open your call for questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. .\nShirley, could you please open the line for questions?"

My name is Ted, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect actions we have taken to create exceptional value. We delivered 97% utilization, achieving record rates at several refineries throughout the quarter. And we leveraged our fully integrated value chain across the West Coast, Gulf Coast and Mid-Con to deliver 105% margin capture.\nCurrent fundamentals especially strong diesel demand, coupled with tight inventory levels remain supportive of strong margins. U.S. gasoline inventories are in line with 5-year averages, and diesel inventories are at historically low levels. As anticipated, sequentially, we saw steady growth across gasoline, diesel and jet.\nOur system was ready to run. Higher OPEC+ production and more Canadian supply should lead to crude differentials widening later this year. Our longer-term fundamental view supports an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining as we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. We expect the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world.\nThe flexibility of our refining assets and our domestic and international logistical and commercial capabilities further increase our global competitive advantage. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. We continue to advance our operational and commercial capabilities to enhance competitiveness, deliver incremental value and achieve peer-leading profitability in each region in which we operate.\nIn the first half of 2025, our Midstream business delivered 5% year-over-year segment adjusted EBITDA growth. MPLX is well positioned to support the development plans of its producer customers especially as demand increases for natural gas-powered electricity and LNG imports -- exports. And with the development of its Gulf Coast fractionation facilities, MPLX is positioned to supply growing global demand for NGLs. MPLX's financial flexibility, its producer customer relationships and strategic road map for growth, all placed it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of its strategic relationship with MPC. Given our highly advantaged refining and marketing business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe Marathon can lead industry in capital returns through all parts of the cycle.\nWe announced two transactions to further our portfolio optimization for today and the future. First, MPC's $425 million divestiture of its partial interest in ethanol production facilities. As the partner's strategic goals evolved and diverged an opportunity came for MPC to exit the partnership. We were able to monetize our interest at a very compelling multiple. We were the largest blender of ethanol before, and we are the largest blender after the sale. There will be no commercial impacts from the sale.\nSecond, MPLX announced the strategic acquisition of [ North Wind Midstream ] for under $2.4 billion. North Wind provides sour gas gathering and treating services in the highly prolific Delaware Basin. Increased crude drilling activity in the eastern edge of the Northern Delaware Basin has been enabled by increased sour gas treating and AGL well capacity provided by these assets. The assets will provide prompt treatment solutions for existing and new producer customers.\nOur fee structure comprises gathering, compression, processing, as well as more extensive CO2 and H2S treating. The higher levels of CO2 and H2S warrant a higher fee structure compared to other regions. On average, this gets to an aggregated rate significantly above other regions. These assets are complementary and adjacent to our existing Delaware Basin natural gas system and will expand MPLX's treating and blending operations. The addition of 200,000 dedicated acres will increase MPLX's access to natural gas and NGL volumes. The optionality to direct these new volumes through our integrated system will accelerate our growth opportunities in the Permian.\nThe transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to MPLX's distributable cash flow and represents a 7x multiple on forecasted '27 EBITDA after the treating system reaches full capacity. MPLX's execution of its wellhead-to-water growth strategy, and the ability to accelerate growth opportunities in the Permian, extends the duration of its anticipated mid-single-digit EBITDA growth. We believe execution of our strategic commitments, including portfolio optimization, will position our integrated system to deliver industry-leading capital returns and offer a compelling value proposition for our shareholders.\nNow I'll hand it over to John to discuss our financial performance.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Moving to second quarter highlights. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $3.96 per share. And during the quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.\nSlide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter to second quarter 2025, and the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and our net results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion, higher sequentially by $1.3 billion, primarily due to increased results in our Refining and Marketing segment.\nMoving to our R&M second quarter segment results on Slide 7. Our refineries ran at 97% utilization, processing 2.9 million barrels of crude per day. R&M segment adjusted EBITDA was $6.79 per barrel, reflecting strong operational and commercial performance.\nTurning to Slide 8. Second quarter capture of 105% was driven by our strategic execution to grow our product channels and favorable secondary product pricing relative to gasoline. Leveraging our integrated value chain, we achieved strong profitable growth through our product sales channels, including brand, wholesale and export sales. We are committed to improving our commercial performance and believe we are building capabilities that will provide sustained incremental value and will produce results that can be seen in our financials.\nWe are also making investments in our Refining and Marketing segment targeted on growing our margins. The multiyear projects at our Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries increase our ability to produce higher-value products, and the execution of smaller high-return quick hit projects drive incremental yield and performance improvements.\nSlide 9 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth with year-to-date segment adjusted EBITDA increasing 5% over last year. In the second quarter of 2025, MPC received distributions of $619 million from MPLX, a 12.5% increase compared to the $550 million received in the second quarter of last year. MPLX remains a source of durable growth as it progresses its mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth strategy.\nSlide 10 shows our renewable diesel segment performance for the quarter. Our renewable diesel facilities operated at 76% for the quarter, which included a planned full plant turnaround at our Dickinson facility. Margins improved as we realized incremental [indiscernible] production tax credits in the second quarter, and we will continue to focus on optimizing our renewable facilities leveraging logistics and our pretreatment capabilities.\nSlide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.6 billion for the quarter. Working capital was a $34 million source of cash for the quarter. Inventory drawdowns to normal operating levels were a source of cash, but they were offset by higher product receivables from increased sales volumes.\nSecond quarter capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were just over $1 billion, approximately $350 million for MPC on a stand-alone basis, and almost $700 million for MPLX. In the quarter, MPC repaid $1.25 billion in senior notes, which matured in May, and MPLX redeemed $1.2 billion of senior notes, which were scheduled to mature in June. At the end of the quarter, MPC had cash of nearly $300 million, and MPLX cash of approximately $1.4 billion. We manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile, supported by the $2.5 billion and growing annual distribution from MPLX, our strong balance sheet provides us the financial flexibility to execute our strategy.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 12. We provide our third quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 92%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the quarter, with activity mainly focused in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. For the full year, turnaround expenses are expected to be similar to last year at around $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.70 per barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be $1.5 billion, and corporate costs are expected to be $240 million.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, John. Our strategic priorities and commitments have produced sustained structural advantages. Safe and reliable operations are foundational. Operational excellence is integral. And paired with strong commercial execution, we should deliver peer-leading profitability. We will continue to optimize our portfolio for today and the future through strategic investments and divestitures, such as the sale of our partial interest in ethanol production facilities.\nWe will execute our $1.25 billion stand-alone capital plan for 2025 and with 70% targeted on high-return projects designed to create optionality and improve our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. MPLX has announced $3.5 billion of acquisitions so far this year, enhancing the growth platform of its natural gas and NGL value chain strategy, and remains on track to invest $1.7 billion on organic growth plans in 2025.\nMPLX differentiates MPC from peers. Providing distributions that we expect to cover MPC's dividends, stand-alone capital spending and more. MPLX increased its distribution by 12.5% last year, and expect to see similar increases for the next few years. Our integrated value chain and diversified assets position us to lead in capital allocation.\nLet me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\n[Operator Instructions] We will now open the call for questions.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Let me highlight a few elements of our performance that were most relevant to our results in the first quarter. Refining utilization of 89%, reflecting the safe and successful completion of the highest -- second highest amount of planned turnarounds in history focused heavily on our Gulf Coast region.\nWe plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter, a period of seasonally weaker demand. capture was 104% as we delivered strong commercial performance in a period of low refining margins and volatility from regulatory uncertainty. Our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA grew 8% year-over-year, and MPLX announced over $1 billion of strategic acquisitions, advancing our midstream natural gas and NGL growth strategies.\nOur longer-term fundamental view supports an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. Despite reductions to the 2025 demand outlook forecasts still point to a global oil demand growth. mainly driven by demand for the refined products we produce. U.S. refined product inventories have drawn for the ninth straight week and are below the 5-year average. This plus lower retail prices should be supportive as we move into the summer driving season, a period of strong seasonal demand.\nWithin our own domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And while light-heavy differentials could remain narrow as Canadian producers increase maintenance in the second quarter, we believe that higher OPEC place plus production could offset that near-term tightness. We believe underlying fundamentals support stronger margins, especially as announced refinery closures offset recent capacity additions.\nWe anticipate around 800,000 barrels per day coming offline across several refineries in the U.S. and Europe this year. In the U.S., the Gulf Coast refinery completed its closure in the first quarter and in California, 2 announced closures are expected over the next 12 months. We have been investing in our fully integrated West Coast value chain. California demand for our products is driven by the 28 million conventional fuel vehicles in the state, among other factors and with nearly $8 million in Los Angeles, the L.A. region is one of the 3 largest refined product demand centers in the U.S.\nAt our Los Angeles refinery, we are nearing completion of approximately $700 million in infrastructure improvements to integrate and modernize utility systems to improve reliability and increase energy efficiency while also complying with tighter emission reduction regulations. Following completion expected at the end of this year, these improvements are intended to strengthen the competitiveness of our Los Angeles refinery and position us to be one of the most cost competitive players in the region for years to come.\nOur long-term positive fundamental view for the refining industry is unchanged, and we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalization through the end of the decade. We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. The U.S. has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude, which we believe will grow as the cost of transportation increases.\nThe availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and the U.S. refining system flexibility all increase its competitive advantage over international sources of supply. The flexibility of our fighting assets and our domestic and international logistical and commercial capabilities further increase our global competitive advantage.\nOur commitment to commercial excellence regardless of market conditions, remains core to our execution. We believe that the capabilities we are building provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, we look to demonstrate that through our financial performance. We are progressing our $1.25 billion stand-alone capital plan for 2025 with 70% targeted on high-return projects, designed to create optionality and improve our ability to capitalize on market volatility. Underpinning our commitment to safe and reliable operations maintenance capital is approximately 30% of that capital spend.\nIn addition to the project at our LAR refinery, in our Mid-Con region, we are increasing our flexibility to optimize jet production at our Robinson refinery to meet growing demand with completion expected by year-end 2026.\nOn the Gulf Coast, we are constructing a distillate hydrotreater at our Galveston Bay refinery to produce higher-value ultra-low-sulfur diesel with completion expected by year-end 2027. In addition to these multiyear projects, we are executing smaller, high-return, quick hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions, we are well positioned to deliver peer-leading through-cycle cash generation.\nIn our Midstream business, we've announced over $1 billion of strategic acquisitions since the start of the year. First, within its NGL value chain, MPLX will be acquiring the remaining 55% interest in the BANGL NGL pipeline. Full ownership of BANGL and its expansion opportunities enhance MPLX's Permian platform, as we connect growing NGL production from the wellhead to our recently announced Gulf Coast fractionation facilities. The BANGL transaction is anticipated to close in July, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.\nSecond, MPLX expanded its crude oil value chain by acquiring gathering businesses from Whit tail Midstream in March. The San Juan Basin assets in the Four Corners region enhances supply to our refining system.\nThird, within its natural gas value chain, MPLX has entered into an agreement to double its stake in the Matterhorn Express natural gas pipeline from 5% to 10%. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. These acquisitions are expected to be immediately accretive. We're all well aware of the volatility in the commodity markets. However, based on feedback from our producer customers, we continue to expect year-over-year growth across our Marcellus, Utica and Permian operating regions. These basins have some of the lowest breakeven prices in the U.S., offering economically advantaged development opportunities.\nWe believe MPLX is well positioned and has significant opportunities to support the development plans of its producer customers, especially as demand increases for natural gas-powered electricity.\nMPLX's financial flexibility places it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of its strategic relationship with MPC. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle.\nNow I'll hand it over to John to discuss our financial performance.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Moving to first quarter highlights. Slide 4 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported a first quarter net loss of $0.24 per share -- during the quarter, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.\nSlide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2024 to first quarter 2025 and the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and our net results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $2 billion, lower sequentially by $145 million due to decreased results in our Refining and Marketing and renewable diesel segments.\nIn addition to effects from the mix of pretax earnings between our R&M and Midstream businesses, our tax rate was further lowered by discrete tax benefits recognized in the quarter.\nMoving to our Refining and Marketing. First quarter segment results on Slide 6. Our refineries ran at 89% utilization, processing 2.6 million barrels of crude per day. We completed significant planned turnaround activity in the quarter, particularly in our Gulf Coast region, where utilization decreased from 97% in the fourth quarter of last year to 82% in the first quarter. As compared to fourth quarter of last year, the effects of lower Gulf Coast volumes were partially offset by higher margins in the Mid-Con and the West Coast. R&M segment adjusted EBITDA was $1.91 per barrel for the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. First quarter capture of 104% was driven by solid commercial execution as well as seasonally strong clean product tailwinds. We leverage the scale of our fully integrated system across all 3 regions to capture margin opportunities across our entire value chain from feedstocks to products.\nSlide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth with an 8% year-over-year increase in quarterly segment adjusted EBITDA. And in the first quarter, MPC received $619 million of distributions from MPLX, a 12.5% increase compared to the $550 million received in the first quarter of 2024. The MPLX remains a source of durable growth as it progresses its mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth strategy.\nSlide 9 shows our renewable diesel segment performance for the quarter in what was a challenging environment. Our renewable diesel facilities ran at 70% utilization, mainly as a result of unplanned downtime at both facilities. As compared to last year's fourth quarter, the segment's largest headwind was changes in regulatory credits, which reduced margins across the industry. As we look forward, based on the latest guidance, we have already taken actions, we expect will allow us to realize incremental 45 credits starting at the beginning of the second quarter. And we will continue to pursue value for the 45 credits we were unable to recognize in the first quarter.\nThat said, we're focused on what we can control. At our Martinez joint venture facility, one of the most competitive renewable diesel operations in the U.S., we are optimizing the renewable refinery to its nameplate capacity, leveraging flexible logistics and pretreatment capabilities to enable a diverse slate and margin. We have addressed the operational items that limited production in the first quarter and following some planned downtime at our Dickinson refinery in April, both our renewable refineries are positioned to run in the second quarter.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1 billion for the quarter, driven by the strength and growth of our midstream business. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by inventory builds mostly in our Gulf Coast region. Crude and product inventory builds related to planned turnarounds here in the first and second quarters as well as product bills related to in-transit export shipments.\nIn the second quarter, we expect some, but maybe not all of this inventory build will reverse as turnarounds are completed and inventory is drawn to normal operating levels. First quarter capital expenditures and investments were $795 million and MPLX completed the acquisition of a gathering business from Whiptail Midstream for $237 million. In the quarter, MPC issued $2 billion in senior notes -- and this issuance was intended to replace the $750 million of senior notes that matured in September of last year as well as refinance the $1.25 billion of senior notes that matured on May 1.\nMPLX repaid $500 million of maturing debt in February and also issued $2 billion of senior notes. MPLX used a portion of the proceeds to retire $1.2 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in June. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $3.8 billion in consolidated cash including MPC cash of $1.3 billion and MPLX cash of $2.5 billion. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.\nWe remain comfortable with our minimum target of about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet being sufficient to run the business. And this is supported by the $2.5 billion and growing annual distribution from MPLX as well as our undrawn credit facilities of $5 billion, all positioning us to have ample liquidity to endure market fluctuations.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our second quarter outlook. With major planned turnaround activity behind us, we are ready to run to meet increasing seasonal demand. We're projecting throughput volumes of 2.8 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94% and Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $265 million in the second quarter, with activity mainly focused in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions.\nFor the full year, turnaround expenses are expected to be similar to last year at around $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.30 per barrel in the second quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Corporate costs are expected to be $220 million.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI would now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the MPC and MPLX executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. I wanted to quickly highlight our new segment reporting, which includes a renewable diesel segment. We believe this expanded level of reporting will enhance our comparability with our peers and provide you with more insight into our financial performance and capital allocation decisions.\nPreviously, the results of the renewable diesel business were included in our Refining & Marketing segment. For your reference, Slides 24 and 25 provide illustrations of this reporting change, and we have provided recast historical financials in our investor packet available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning. Let me take a moment to highlight a few elements of our performance that we were -- that were most relevant to our results. In 2024, we executed on our strategic commitments. First and foremost, we achieved our lowest company-wide OSHA recordable injury rate and strongest environmental performance in the last 5 years, demonstrating our commitment to safety and reliability.\nOver the full year, we delivered Refining and Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA per barrel of $5.33. Our commitment to operational excellence, commercial performance and peer-leading profitability per barrel in each of the regions in which we operate drove our strong results with refining utilization of 92% and commercial capture of 99%. Our Midstream segment, which is where we report MPLX's results, grew adjusted EBITDA by 6% year-over-year.\nIn 2024, MPLX increased its quarterly distribution by 12.5%, driving an annualized cash distribution to MPC of $2.5 billion. This was the third consecutive year of distribution growth of 10% or greater. This was the fourth consecutive year of MPLX generating mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Since 2021, we've grown adjusted EBITDA at a compound annual rate of 7%.\nOur full year net cash from operations was $8.7 billion. This enabled peer-leading capital return of $10.2 billion and a 23% capital return yield for our shareholders, in a business where there is significant value and the ability to return capital to shareholders.\nThe global macro environment continues to deliver refined product demand growth and we expect 2025 will be another year of record refined product demand in our domestic and export businesses, we have seen steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and diesel and growth in demand for jet fuel. Fourth quarter refining margins exhibited their typical seasoned weakness. We expect margins will improve in the second half of this year as announced to refinery closures offset recent capacity additions.\nLeveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions, we are well positioned to perform in this dynamic market environment. Longer term, we believe fundamentals support an enhanced to mid-cycle environment for refining as we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. We expect the U.S. refining industry to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world, mainly due to the availability of low-cost energy.\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to safely and reliably operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, business partners and the community in which we operate.\nOur high complexity refining assets in our domestic and international logistical and commercial capabilities further increase our global competitive advantage. We are committed to achieving peer-leading profitability in every region in which we operate. And over the past several years, we have acted to advance on this commitment. We have made sustained structural changes to improve our cost competitiveness while maintaining safe and reliable operations. Throughout our commercial organization, we are improving value chain optimization with a more integrated an advanced approach to our execution.\nWe made disciplined investments in our refining and marketing value chains targeted to enhance margins, reduce cost and optimize systems. Across all 3 of our regions, we see the results of these actions. Along the U.S. Gulf Coast, where 42% of our capacity exists, we have more than 1.2 million barrels per day of refining capacity, which leverage feedstock and logistics flexibility to provide a wide range of products to meet U.S. and export demand. 40% of our capacity is defined as our U.S. Mid-Con regions. We have 8 refineries with a total capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day, which capture market opportunities by leveraging our access to advantaged feedstocks, logistics and optimization of our large integrated value chain in the region. The remaining 18% of our capacity resides along the U.S. West Coast anchored by our 365,000 barrel per day Los Angeles Refinery and its fully integrated value chain, which benefits from feedstock and product optionality and a highly competitive marketing business.\nOur commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence and commercial performance position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance, irrespective of the market environment.\nOur disciplined capital investments have also strengthened our competitiveness in each of the regions in which we operate. Looking into 2025, we believe our planned capital investments will further enhance MPC's position well into the future. MPC's capital outlook for 2025, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety performance and environmental stewardship, sustaining capital is approximately 30% of capital spend. Investments in our Refining and Marketing segment are focused on value-enhancing and cost reduction opportunities with expected returns averaging around 30%.\nRenewable diesel capital spend in 2025 is limited and will be focused on sustaining current operations. I'll provide some details on 3 of our major multiyear projects that meet our criteria for investment. We are progressing the distillate hydrotreater project at Galveston Bay, where we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, allowing us to place product in this higher-value market. This project is expected to be completed by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%.\nThe Los Angeles Refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This low carbon refining investment once completed, is expected to further enhance its competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems to improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of the improvements address a regulation mandating emissions reductions for all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of this year. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%.\nThe Robinson product flexibility project is expected to further extend the competitive position of our Mid-Con value chain by shifting yields to higher-value products. This investment will increase the Robinson refinery's flexibility to maximize jet production to meet growing demand. We expect the project to be completed by the end of 2026 and generate a return of approximately 25%. The strategic investments at our Galveston Bay, Los Angeles and Robinson refineries ensure we provide the clean burning fuels of the world demand and further strengthen the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast and Mid-Con value chains.\nThis morning, MPLX also announced its 2025 capital outlook of $2 billion, including $1.7 billion of growth capital and $300 million of maintenance capital. Approximately 85% of its growth capital will be allocated to investments to grow MPLX's natural gas and NGL businesses in support of expected increased producer activity. MPLX is investing to expand its Permian to Gulf Coast integrated NGL value chain, progressing long-haul pipeline projects and grow Permian and Marcellus processing capacity. MPLX anticipates mid-teen returns on its growth capital outlook, which will extend the durability of its mid-single-digit growth profile.\nOver the last 4 years, on average, we have grown our midstream segment adjusted EBITDA by almost 7% per year. The growth of MPLX's cash flows, combined with its strong distribution coverage and low leverage, provides MPLX considerable financial flexibility. We believe MPLX is positioned for additional distribution increases like the 12.5% announced in 2024 in the future.\nMPLX reached a significant milestone in its NGL wellhead to water value chain strategy with the announcement of a project to construct the Gulf Coast fractionation complex and export terminal. MPLX's fully integrated NGL value chain connects the Permian to the Gulf Coast and will supply growing global demand for LPGs. The multiyear $2.5 billion investment in the fractionation complex and export terminal complements MPLX's existing asset base and leverages existing infrastructure. MPLX will build and operate the Gulf Coast fractionation complex, consisting of two 150,000 barrel per day fractionation facilities and a 400,000 barrel per day LPG export terminal, all of which will be located adjacent to MPC's Galveston Bay refinery.\nMPLX has entered into joint venture agreements with ONEOK for the export terminal and the bidirectional purity pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Texas City. ONEOK will market its 200,000 barrels per day and provide connectivity to Mont Belvieu storage, enhancing the competitiveness of the terminal. We also believe this strategic partnership with ONEOK will create additional optionality and value for our customers. We also see it as a platform for future collaboration and growth across our Gulf Coast assets.\nMPLX plans to market [ methane ] production from the fracs to both existing and new customers. Leveraging our strategic relationship with MPLX, MPC plans to contract with MPLX to purchase the remaining LPG production from the frac, which MPC will market globally through its existing market businesses via the new export terminal. The fractionation facilities are expected to be in service in 2028 and 2029, and the export terminal is expected to be in service in early 2028. We anticipate mid-teen returns on the project, which is expected to begin generating EBITDA when placed in service in 2028 and will ramp through the end of 2030. Additionally, we believe the expansion of our Gulf Coast NGL value chain will create a platform for optimization and incremental growth opportunities.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our #1 priority is sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We will invest where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness, and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these 3 objectives, we will return all excess capital through share repurchases.\nAs of the end of the year, we had $7.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. The durable and growing cash flow of MPLX differentiates MPC from peers. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, and therefore, its value proposition. We expect distributions from MPLX in 2025 will cover MPC's dividend and stand-alone capital outlook. Operating cash flow generated by our Refining and Marketing and Renewable Diesel segment, are expected to be available for capital return through share repurchases.\nWith our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we are positioned to lead peers in capital returns through all market cycles. Let me turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Moving to the fourth quarter and full year highlights, Slide 14 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the fourth quarter and $9.51 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, and $11.3 billion for the year. Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA per barrel was $2.03 for the quarter and $5.33 for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was $1.7 billion for the quarter and nearly $8.2 billion for the year. And during the quarter, we returned $292 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased nearly $1.3 billion of our shares.\nSlide 15 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from third to fourth quarter 2024 and the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $400 million, driven by decreased results in our Refining and Marketing segment, slightly offset by improved results for our midstream and renewable diesel segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 12%, largely reflecting the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses.\nMoving to our Refining and Marketing segment results for the fourth quarter on Slide 16, lower crack spreads, mainly in the Mid-Con region were the primary driver for lower R&M margins in the fourth quarter. Our refineries ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day and refining operating costs were $5.26 per barrel in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 17, solid commercial execution as well as typical seasonal tailwinds drove fourth quarter capture of 119%. We leveraged the scale of our fully integrated system in all 3 regions to capture margin opportunities across our entire value chain from feedstocks to products. We are committed to improving our commercial performance and believe we are building capabilities that will provide sustained incremental value and will produce results that can be seen in our financials.\nSlide 18 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth as segment adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up nearly 5% sequentially. MPLX, which is the largest portion of our Midstream segment remains a source of durable growth as it progresses its mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth strategy.\nSlide 19 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $497 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by benefits from inventory reductions and a decrease in refined product prices. Capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $935 million for the quarter. Cash was utilized to repay $1.15 billion of MPLX senior notes that matured in December. And MPC returned almost $1.3 billion through share repurchases, exclusive of excise tax payments and $292 million in dividends during the quarter. At the end of the year, MPC had approximately $3.2 billion in consolidated cash, including MPC cash of $1.7 billion and MPLX cash of $1.5 billion.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 20, we provide our first quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 85%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $450 million in the first quarter with activity focused in the Gulf Coast and West Coast regions. For the full year, turnaround expenses are expected to be similar to last year at around $1.4 billion. For the quarter, operating costs are projected to be $5.70 per the barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $220 million. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yields sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future.

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. [indiscernible].\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slide accompanies this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab.\nJoining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPC over the last 4 years. Mike's record of accomplishment has been tremendously valuable. During his tenure, Mike delivered its transformative strategic priorities and returned a peer-leading $40 billion to shareholders. We're fortunate to have Mike as Executive Chairman of MPC's Board going forward.\nMoving to the global macro environment. In the second quarter, supply of refined products reached all-time seasonal highs. The margin environment supported assets running at high utilization and new capacity additions continue to ramp. At the same time, demand for refined products fit new records globally. We expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within MPC's domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and diesel and growing demand for jet fuel.\nAs we look forward, demand growth is expected to outpace near-term capacity additions over time with limited global refining capacity additions expected through the end of the decade. These fundamentals still support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. we believe our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate.\nOur fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions provide us with a competitive advantage. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, uniquely positioning us to capture market opportunities. Our execution remains core to our value delivery our disciplined capital investments are focused on high-return projects.\nIn refining, we are making investments predominantly in our large competitively advantaged facilities to optimize our assets and position MPC well into the future. In midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities focused on bringing in incremental third-party cash flows. We continue to grow our natural gas and NGL value chains. In the second quarter, MPLX closed the Whistler transaction.\nLast week, MPLX and its partners reached FID on the Blackcomb natural gas pipeline. It will be a 2.5 Bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026.\nAdditionally, MPLX recently increased its ownership in Bengal. This pipeline transports NGLs from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas, and it is currently expanding its capacity to 250,000 barrels a day. This transaction is immediately accretive and enhances MPLX's Permian NGL value chain as part of its developing well-head water strategy.\nMPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, providing a $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution to MPC. This fully covers MPC's dividend and nearly all of our 2024 capital program. In our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX, has grown its adjusted EBITDA at nearly 7% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provide MPLX financial flexibility, placing it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship.\nMPLX -- sorry, MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC share count by nearly 50%. And Cash generation will continue to influence buyback capacity as we return to a normalized balance sheet. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.2 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle.\nMPC generated second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.12 our operational excellence and commercial performance support our quarterly results. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 97%, capture of 94%, up 2%, while other refining peers reported sequential declines. Adjusted R&M EBITDA per barrel of $7.07 and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $2.7 billion, both of which led refining peers, and we returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results.\nLet me turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by $133 million, driven by increased results in both our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 16%, resulting in a tax provision of $373 million. The second quarter tax rate largely reflects the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the second quarter. Following significant turnaround activity in the first quarter, our refineries ran at 97% utilization, processing nearly 2.9 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $4.97 per barrel in the second quarter, lower, sequentially, primarily due to higher throughputs, lower project-related expenses associated with reduced turnaround activity and lower energy costs. In our largest region, the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating costs were $3.73 per barrel, demonstrating our cost competitiveness. Sequentially, per barrel margins were down primarily due to lower crack spreads.\nSlide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 94% for the quarter. Capture in the quarter reflected tailwinds from gasoline margins, offset by increased headwinds from secondary product pricing, which was driven by high refining industry utilization. Gasoline margins were supported by a falling price environment during the quarter, and in addition, our integrated system and realized demand across our multiple sales channels was a competitive differentiator to our capture performance.\nSlide 8 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2024. Our Midstream segment is generating strong cash flows. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC.\nThe two midstream transactions Maryann discussed earlier further enhance our Permian value chains for both natural gas and NGLs. Through organic growth and disciplined investments, MPLX continues to provide growing cash flows to NPC. MPLX is a differentiator in the MPC portfolio and remains a source of durable earnings growth. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $541 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in refined product prices.\nThis quarter, capital expenditures and investments were $541 million and during the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in tenured senior notes, the proceeds of which MPLX expects to use to retire senior notes maturing in December of this year and February of next year. MPC returned $2.9 billion through share repurchases and $290 million in dividends during the quarter. And in July, we repurchased just over $900 million of MPC shares, leaving $5.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations and highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, excluding cash at MPLX.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 10, we provide our third quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing a utilization of 90%. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $330 million in the third quarter, with activity focused in the Mid-Con and Gulf Coast regions. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be approximately $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.35 per barrel in the third quarter.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.55 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation. The R&M segment generated $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and MPLX distributed $550 million to MPC. This supported investments of over $500 million and capital return of approximately $3.2 billion. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, John. My priorities are consistent with those that made MPC a peer-leading energy investment. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance irrespective of the market environment.\nTo do this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages, ensure the competitiveness of our assets and continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation. durable midstream growth should deliver cash flow uplift. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness. We are committed to leading in capital allocation. We will return excess capital through share repurchases. We and PC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and a compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions]"

Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Effective March 1, two new independent directors join the MPC Board. Eileen Drake and Kimberly Ellison-Taylor have strong records of accomplishment in complex industries making them outstanding additions, and we're happy to have them join our Board.\nAs for the macro refining environment, we remain constructive in our view. Oil demand is at a record high globally, and we expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlook for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023 and primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Within our own domestic and export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And we continue to believe that 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption.\nGlobal supply remains constrained. Anticipated capacity additions have progressed more slowly than expected. And longer term, the level of announced capacity additions remains limited for the rest of the decade. In the first quarter, high global turnaround activity, the transition to summer gasoline blends and light product inventories supported refining fundamentals, especially towards the end of the quarter. As we look forward, we believe these fundamentals will support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for the refining industry. We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world.\nOur system has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude which we believe will grow as cost of transportation increases, the availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and our refining systems complexity all increase our competitive advantage over the international sources of supply. Even with this outlook, we remain focused on capital discipline while investing to grow earnings at strong returns. In the first quarter, we invested over $1.3 billion in capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions comprised of attractive refining projects and midstream investments, including MPLX's $625 million strategic acquisition in the Utica Basin.\nIn refining, we are investing predominantly at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. With a focus on safety and asset reliability, we successfully completed the largest amount of planned maintenance work in MPC's history. Four of our largest and most profitable refineries were in turnaround during the quarter, limiting our financial performance. These assets were in turnaround during a period of lower demand and now we're ready to meet the increased consumption that comes with the summer driving season.\nIn midstream, MPLX continues to execute on attractive growth opportunities. The Harmon Creek [ II ] gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing MPLX's [ Marcellus ] processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. And in the Permian Basin, [ Preakness 2 ] is approaching startup and expect it to be online by the end of May. We're also building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would average to a pace of roughly one new plant per year since 2018.\nAdditionally, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, MPLX enhanced its footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We've already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler pipeline and Rio Bravo pipeline projects into a newly formed joint venture. The platform expands MPLX's natural gas value chain and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution MPC fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to continue to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship.\nOur overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and we intend to grow the company's earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. Beyond these three priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Demonstrating this commitment, today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Our total capital return through share repurchases and dividends since May of 2021 now totals $35 billion with MPC share count reduced by nearly 50%.\nLet me take a second to share our view on value. We continue to believe share repurchases make sense at the current share price level. When we purchased MPC stock, we are buying into a premier, highly advantaged refining system. We're also buying into a growing midstream business via our ownership at MPLX. And finally, we are buying strong business execution, disciplined investment and a commitment to capital returns, which will continue to position MPC as an excellent investment.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThank you, Mike. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate earnings per share of $2.58 for the quarter and $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, while having four of our largest refineries in turnaround. This quarter, in conjunction with the planned turnaround activity, we took the opportunity to execute incremental smaller, high-return, quick hit projects focused on optimization and reliability initiatives. This planned maintenance activity contributed to a reduction in refinery throughput of nearly 270,000 barrels per day or 9% compared with the fourth quarter. We plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter with a focus on safety and asset integrity and in a period of seasonally weaker demand. Now with a large portion of our 2024 activity complete, we are well positioned to run our refining system near full utilization through the summer driving season.\nCapture in the quarter was 92% and reflects the seasonal market backdrop. Light product margins were weaker and product inventory builds were both headwinds to quarterly results. Our commitment to commercial excellence remains foundational. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, and we expect to continue to see the impact in our quarterly results.\nWe are successfully progressing our 2024 capital investment plan. This includes executing on a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery and construction of a distillate [ hydrotreater ] at our Galveston Bay refinery, both expected to yield returns of approximately 20% or more. In addition to these large projects, we continue to execute on smaller, high-return, quick hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost.\nLet me turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by heavy planned turnaround activity, resulting in lower R&M throughputs.\nTo assist with your analysis, we thought it helpful to note the company recorded an $89 million or $0.20 per share charge resulting from the quarterly fair value remeasurement of certain long-term incentive compensation. Aligned with shareholder value creation, the charge was driven by the $53 or 36% increase in our share price as well as our total shareholder return performance versus our peers during the quarter. Again, this charge, which we did not adjust for reduced earnings by $0.20 per share.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 18%, resulting in a tax provision of $293 million. While this rate is lower than what we'd expect for the [ seat ] to see for the year, it reflects the permanent tax benefits of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in MPLX as well as a discrete benefit related to equity compensation realized in the quarter.\nMoving to our segment results, slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the first quarter. Our refining and marketing results reflect lower throughputs associated with planned turnaround activity as our refineries ran at 82% utilization processing over 2.4 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $6.14 per barrel in the first quarter. Higher sequentially, primarily due to the lower throughputs. Sequentially, per barrel margins were up slightly as higher crack spreads were offset by lower margin capture.\nSlide 9 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment is growing and generating strong cash flows. In this quarter, MPLX's distribution contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. As Mike said, MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was over $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $389 million use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by minor builds in crude and refined product inventories mainly related to the turnaround activity. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $1.3 billion, including $710 million of growth and maintenance capital and $622 million for MPLX acquisitions net of cash received. Highlighting our steadfast commitment to superior shareholder returns, MPC returned $2.5 billion via repurchases and dividends during the quarter.\nAs Mike commented, earlier today, we announced the approval of an additional $5 billion for share repurchases and as of April 26, we have $8.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. And from May of 2021 through April 26 of this year, we have repurchased 312 million shares or 48% of the shares that were outstanding in May of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, MPC had approximately $7.6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, which includes $385 million of MPLX cash.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. With our significant first quarter turnaround activity behind us, we are projecting higher throughput volumes of nearly 2.8 million barrels per day representing utilization of 94%. Planned turnaround expense is expected to be approximately $200 million in the second quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con region. Operating costs are projected to be $4.95 per barrel in the second quarter, much lower than the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of running our system near full utilization and lower expected operating costs. For the full year, we expect operating cost per barrel to trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel subject to energy cost volatility. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $200 million.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nIn summary, our unwavering commitment to safety, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement positions us well. We will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. The enhanced mid-cycle environment should continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand.\nMPLX remains a source of growth and a unique competitive advantage in our portfolio. We believe it will continue to grow its cash distributions to cover both MPC's dividend and capital requirements and still generate excess cash before the first dollar of refining EBITDA is earned. Another way to frame it, MPC has reduced its share count from approximately $650 million in May of 2021, down to approximately $355 million at the end of the first quarter. Over this same time frame, the MPLX units owned by MPC has held roughly flat at approximately 650 million units. So the ratio of MPLX units held by MPC to our outstanding shares or the potential value to MPC on a per share basis from MPLX has nearly doubled. The midstream business, which continues to grow, provides a unique value proposition for MPC shareholders. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns supported by our steadfast commitment to return capital.\nConsistent with our goal to have the strongest through-cycle cash generation, even with four of our most profitable refineries in turnaround adjusted on a comparable basis, we still generated more cash from operations than our refining peers. I'm very proud of the team's accomplishments.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Mike. As we open the call up for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we'll reprompt for additional questions. With that, operator, we're ready."

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call.[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under industry cab.\nMichael Hennigan CEO; Maryann Mannen, President, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results could differ. Factors that cause actual results to differ are there as well as in our SEC enforcement, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. First, I'd like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee an has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results.\nAt a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results. We're pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team's strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%.\nThese results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX's most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program.\nWe expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns.\nExecuting on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in '23, and we see another year of record oil consumption in '24. The [ IEA ] is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations.\nGasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into '24 anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply-demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets. protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We're committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these 3 objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count.\nFrom May of '21 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC's stand-alone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs.\nIn low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the MPC and Permian basins. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Mike. Solid execution of our 3 strategic pillars remain foundational. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational, and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage.\nTurning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November, and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon.\nWe are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yield at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our costs as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. And $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities.\nSlide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This investment once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitive by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.\nWe expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distilled hydro- treater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high solver distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower-value high sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain.\nThe project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives. We challenge ourselves to lead in greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions that [indiscernible], one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like [indiscernible] superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn J. Quaid\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights. Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of 3 items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge. $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX's Garyville incident response and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX.\nAdjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. [Audio Gap] EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, and reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes.\nFor 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%. And Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter.\nWe ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from light product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel, as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices. Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses.\nWorking capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from Ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX's acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns.\nAs of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17. We provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million.\nWe are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion. Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, John. We've delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low-cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We've invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives.\nLooking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I'm sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC's Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it's in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increase against distribution 10% of reach in the last 2 years, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020.\nEach 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC's total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions.

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Michael Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC's refining [indiscernible] for the third quarter as well as fourth quarter guidance now include the addition of approximately 40,000 barrels a day of capacity related to STAR in our Gulf Coast region.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThank you, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Beginning with our view on the refining environment. In the third quarter, we saw strong demand and global supply tightness supporting refining margins. Diesel cracks led the barrels inventories remain tight and European distillate production ran below capacity. Globally, oil demand is at a record high as the need for affordable and reliable energy increases throughout the world. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year across the gasoline and diesel and demand for jet fuel continues to grow.\nGlobal supply remains constrained and global capacity additions have progressed at a slow pace. In the regions where we operate, seasonal butane blending has increased gasoline supply. However, we expect typical seasonal turnarounds to be supportive of cracks. To that end, we have seen 3.5 million barrels of gasoline inventory drawn out of the U.S. system over the past several weeks. OPEC Plus has reduced production adding pressure to medium sour differentials. While crude differentials have generally been narrowing, we have seen WCS widen and we're strategically situated to run heavy Canadian crude at our refineries across pads 2, 3 and 5. As we look towards 2024, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to the global supply-demand fundamentals and the relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity.\nTurning to our results. In the third quarter, we delivered strong cash generation across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, 94% utilization and solid commercial performance led to segment adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion or $16.06 per barrel. Our midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of over $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, our midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. The strength of MPLX's cash flows supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10%. With this increase, MPC is expected to receive $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2023 capital program.\nWe expect MPLX's cash distribution to continue growing as it pursues growth opportunities, which will further enhance the value of this strategic relationship. We believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned $3.1 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Last week, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and a 10% increase to MPC's quarterly dividend. With this increase, we have grown our quarterly dividend at over 12% compound annual rate over the past 5 years, which has led our refining peers.\nOur overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend, we intend to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. And beyond these 3 priorities, we are firmly committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count.\nLet me also share some of the progress on our low-carbon initiatives. The Martinez renewable fuels facility is being delivered safely, on time and on budget. And by the end of 2023, the facility is expected to produce 730 million gallons per year. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and should benefit from the global strategic relationship with Neste. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility is operating well. The facility processed 75% advantaged feed in the third quarter. The nearby Spiritwood soybean processing plant, which is owned through a joint venture with ADM is expected to deliver enough vegetable oil to produce approximately 75 million gallons per year of renewable diesel.\nAdditionally, we are advancing early-stage developments through our interest in low carbon intensity RNG and other small-scale investments. We believe through these projects, we're taking a disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing and evolving market, while operating our current asset base to deliver superior cash flow and meet demands.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Moving to third quarter highlights. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.14. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $106 million gain on sale of MPC's 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal as well as $63 million of response costs associated with our unplanned outage at Garyville. These adjustments reduced our reported adjusted earnings by $0.14 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.8 billion of our shares. And from May 2021 through October 27, we have repurchased 285 million shares or approximately 44% of the shares outstanding.\nSlide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2023 to third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by approximately $1.2 billion driven by higher R&M margins. Corporate expenses were higher sequentially by $40 million, primarily due to a charge related to valuation of existing performance-based stock compensation expense. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $1 billion.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially, per barrel margins were higher across all regions driven by higher crack spread. Capture was 93%. Refining operating costs were $5.14 per barrel in the third quarter, flat sequentially. We did have unplanned downtime during the quarter, impacting our 2 largest refineries which resulted in lost crude throughput of 4.7 million barrels due to the Galveston Bay reformer outage and 2.1 million barrels at Garyville. Additionally, this downtime resulted in a headwind to our overall capture. We began construction activities on the reform or repair about 3 months after the event, once regulators gave us clearance and we were able to finalize the required repairs. Since then, repairs have progressed as planned and during this outage, we pulled forward turnaround work into the third and fourth quarters which had been scheduled in the first quarter of 2024.\nSlide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 93%. Our commercial team executed effectively despite weak secondary product pricing and refinery downtime, which weighed on capture this quarter. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance is foundational, and we expect to continue to see the results.\nSlide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong third quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially and 3% higher year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughput and rates. Year-to-date, our midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX' earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10% to $0.85 per unit and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basin.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was over $4.3 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $609 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices. Year-to-date, working capital has been $1.4 billion source of cash. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $486 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.1 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximately 72% payout of the $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns.\nAs of October 27, we have approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced last week. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $13.1 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments. This includes approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than third quarter levels due to turnaround activity, having a higher impact on crude units in the fourth quarter. In the Gulf Coast, with respect to the Galveston Bay reformer, repairs have progressed as planned, we anticipate starting the unit back up in mid-November. Production is expected to ramp over the next several weeks. And guidance anticipates returning to full operating rates by mid-December following advanced turnaround activity.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, during this outage, we plan to continue progressing and complete turnaround work that was previously scheduled for 2024. As a result, planned turnaround expense is now projected to be approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter are expected to be $5.60 higher sequentially and due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately [ $1.4 billion ] for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nIn summary, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We'll also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. Through the third quarter, we've invested over $1.7 billion in capital and investment, which includes $390 million of maintenance capital as well as over $900 million on refinery turnarounds in 2023.\nOur focus on safety, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture the enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio. Partnerships is expected to distribute over $2.2 billion to MPC annually and is MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow we believe it will continue to have capacity to increase its cash distributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, supported by our firm commitment to return capital.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Sheila, we're ready for them."

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with our views on the macro environment, refining margins continued strong in the second quarter. Despite crack spreads incentivizing high refining utilization, product inventory levels remain low. Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated, and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong.\nIn the second half of the year, the refining outlook remains healthy. We expect year-over-year U.S. late product demand to grow consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year supported by lower energy prices and recovering air travel. This demand strength post tight inventories and receding economic headwinds are expected to continue to support elevated margins. And as we completed nearly 4 quarters of elevated turnaround activity early in the second quarter, we're expecting an increase in industry plan maintenance work by our peers in almost every region in which we operate. Overall, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to relative advantages over our international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity.\nNow turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, cost discipline and sound commercial performance led to segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.2 billion. Our midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion which is up 5% year-over-year. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it anticipates growing its cash flows and increasing distributions to unitholders. MPLX's distribution MPC was $502 million this quarter, an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's current dividend and half of our planned 2023 capital program, not including MPLX.\nDuring the second quarter, we progressed key projects such as completing the STAR project at the Galveston Bay refinery. The competitive position of our Galveston Bay refinery is enhanced by the increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing as well as distillate recovery. We're well positioned with 2 premier 600,000 barrel per day refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity to support our global commercial strategy. At the Martinez renewable fuels facility, construction activities are progressing. Pretreatment capabilities are starting to come online in the second half of 2023, and the facility is expected to be capable of producing its full capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.\nAt that point, Martinez will be among the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and a strategic relationship with Neste. On capital allocation, in the second quarter, we returned nearly $3.4 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And from May 2021 through the end of July, we have repurchased 264 million shares or approximately 40% of the shares outstanding. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In July, we published our 12th annual sustainability report and our seventh annual perspectives on climate scenarios report. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which aligns with TCFD standards, provides insights into how we see the energy landscape, our thoughts on climate-related risks and opportunities the resources we put towards addressing them and the results that we've achieved.\nOur sustainability report shows continued progress on goals that we have set for ourselves, our efforts to strengthen the resiliency of our operations and to innovate for the future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Moving to second quarter highlights. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $5.32. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $3.1 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $316 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.1 billion of our shares. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, by approximately $700 million as higher refining throughput was more than offset by lower market crack spreads. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance and despite general inflationary pressures, we've maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of our corporate cost since 2020. The tax rate for the second quarter was 18.4% and resulting in a tax provision of approximately $583 million. Our tax provision included a $53 million discrete benefit related to prior years.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Refining utilization increased [ 4% ] to 93% despite significant turnaround activity as plan work had a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. During the quarter at Galveston Bay, an incident occurred at one of the refineries catalytic reformers. This unit has been out of service since May 15. This resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions driven by lower crack spreads and our sour crude differentials. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity early in the quarter.\nRefining operating costs were $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, lower sequentially and due to higher throughput and lower energy costs. Slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 97%. Our commercial team executed effectively and achieved a strong capture result, considering a significant amount of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. Gasoline and distillate margin tailwinds were balanced against weaker secondary product pricing. We are also seeing incremental product yield and crude mix benefits from recent major capital projects. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance has become foundational, and we expect to see the results of this emphasis.\nSlide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong second quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA while flat sequentially was 5% higher year-over-year. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. These disciplined capital investments, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Working capital was an $854 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by changes in crude oil and refined product inventories. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $570 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents a 100% payout of the $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment superior shareholder returns. And as of today, we have approximately $6.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments.\nTurning to guidance, slide 11. We provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94%. Utilization is forecasted to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, and enhance mid-cycle margins, continue to incentivize high refining utilization. While we have not confirmed a start-up date, our throughput guidance assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $120 million in the third quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter are expected to be $5.10, as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower costs, given we have completed the significant portion of our turnaround and project activity.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our second quarter results reflect our team's execution against our strategic pillars across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. Beyond these 3 priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases and to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. In summary, we will continue to invest capital to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets and where we believe there are attractive returns. Year-to-date, we've invested over $1.2 billion. Our focus on operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment.\nMPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio, distributing over $2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe we'll continue to have capacity to increase its cash contributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash flow generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. And now we'll open the call. Sheila?"

The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. .\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.

Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Let me first share our view on the macro environment. In the first quarter, volatility in the global energy market remained high, driven by uncertainties around the potential for recession, the pace of China's economic recovery and the impact of sanctions on Russian products.\nAt the same time, supply remains tight, supported by nearly 4 million barrels per day of global refining capacity that has come offline in the last couple of years. Global demand continues to grow as the need for affordable, reliable energy increases throughout the world. IEA is projecting 2 million barrels a day increase in 2023.\nSince last quarter, distillate cracks have come down, gasoline cracks have improved as expected given the onset of the summer driving season. So overall, we believe supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins throughout 2023. Cracks have decreased from 2022 levels but still above historic mid-cycle levels. In alignment with what we said last quarter, we remain bullish into the driving season, and gasoline strength is expected to improve the diesel situation, while jet demand continues to improve. As we continue through the year, much will depend on the ongoing recovery in China and the extent, if any, of recessionary impacts.\nWe continue building out our global presence, supported by our offices in Houston, London and Singapore as we invest in our global commercial strategy. And our cost advantaged refining system is well positioned to supply growing markets. This quarter, despite significant planned turnaround work at several key facilities, in particular, in our Gulf Coast region at Galveston Bay in Garyville, we delivered the strongest first quarter results in the company's history. Planned maintenance activities reduced refinery throughput by 11 million barrels compared with the fourth quarter.\nOur team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $4 billion or $15.09 per barrel. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it continues to grow its cash flows and capital returns. Our Midstream segment delivers durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year. MPLX distributions to MPC was roughly $500 million this quarter and an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's dividend as well as half of our planned 2023 capital program.\nDuring the first quarter, we advanced value-creating projects. At Galveston Bay, we completed the STAR project. Rather than expand the GBR cokers, we elected to upgrade the resid hydrocracker unit as it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. Fractionation modifications offer increased diesel recovery and the refinery will be able to process significantly more discounted heavy crude.\nOverall, STAR is expected to add 40,000 barrels per day of incremental crude capacity and 17,000 barrels a day of resid processing capacity. Start-up activities are progressing and we expect start to ramp through the second quarter of 2023. The incremental profitability from this project will primarily be determined by the spread between heavy crude and untreated diesel over the incremental 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity.\nAt the Martinez renewable fuels facility, we reached full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels, ramping to design rates and yields as planned. Phase 2 construction activities are on schedule. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 2023, which will enable the facility to ramp to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.\nMartinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities in the world, underpinned by a competitive operating and capital cost profile, robust inbound and outbound logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and our strategic relationship with Neste.\nIn the first quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns.\nLet me share some of the progress on our low-carbon initiatives. The Martinez indicative facilities are competitively advantaged. They're supported by upstream value-creation integration with our Viatris and Cincinnati pretreatment plants and downstream integration with our vast marketing footprint. The strategic partnerships were called debating with Neste, ADM and the Andersons creates platforms for additional collaboration within renewables.\nThis quarter, we had an investment in an emerging producer of dairy farm-based renewable natural gas, providing the ability to participate in early-stage development at an attractive entry point. Our Virent subsidiary is progressing a commercially feasible assessment for converting bio-based feedstocks in the gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel. We believe for these projects and opportunities we are taking steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing market.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Moving to first quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $6.09. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was nearly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $337 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased nearly $3.2 billion of our shares. .\nSlide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2022 to first quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $600 million. This decrease was driven by refining and marketing as refining margins per barrel were down quarter-over-quarter. As we indicated last quarter, throughputs were lower primarily due to the significant planned turnaround activity.\nCorporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of corporate costs since 2020. The tax rate for the first quarter was 21%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $800 million.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliot at the end of December. These impacts carried into the first quarter, reducing our crude throughput by 3 million barrels. Winter storm Elliott and higher planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast region reduced overall refining utilization, which was down 5% to 89%. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in all regions compared with the fourth quarter.\nCapture was 98%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity this quarter. Refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat sequentially in the first quarter at $5.68. Lower throughput compared to the fourth quarter impacted operating cost per barrel. This was partially offset by lower energy costs, primarily in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions, although we experienced higher natural gas prices in the West Coast. We expect operating cost per barrel to be lower in the second quarter as reflected in our guidance.\nSlide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 98%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market environment. Light product margin tailwinds were balanced against impacts associated with inventory builds and planned maintenance activity. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. Still, we believe through our commercial efforts, our capture baseline has moved closer to 100%.\nAs our strategic pillar indicates, we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. We believe these capabilities will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date.\nSlide 9 shows the change in our Midstream adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA was 9% higher year-over-year, reflecting business growth. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing our capital plan with projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. These disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost flow optimization, are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders.\nThis quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us compared to peers without Midstream businesses.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $4.2 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $98 million headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude and product inventory, offsetting benefits from a decrease in refined product receivables related to lower product sales.\nCapital expenditures and investments totaling $664 million this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the first quarter as were progressed on the Martinez renewable fuel facility conversion and the completion of the Galveston Bay STAR project. MPC returned over $3.5 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an 85% payout of the nearly $4.2 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns.\nWe now have $9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced today. At the end of the first quarter, NPC had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 91%. Utilization is forecast to be higher than the first quarter levels due to planned turnaround activity having a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter.\nPlanned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. We expect turnaround activity to be front-half weighted in 2023. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to spend roughly $760 million on turnaround in 2023 and anticipate the full year turnaround spend to be comparable to the level of spend in 2022. Operating cost per barrel in the second quarter are expected to be lower at $5.20 as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower energy costs.\nAs we look further into 2023, we anticipate our operating cost per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel as we complete turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.35 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.\nTo recap, our first quarter results reflect our team's strong operational and commercial execution across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline beyond these 3 priorities we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count.\nWith that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Maryann. In summary, our results reflect the strongest first quarter in the company's history, generating $5.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio, distributing just over $500 million MPC this quarter. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we'll have capacity to increase capital returns to MPC.\nThis quarter, we invested $664 million. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. We remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. Solid execution of our 3 strategic pillars is foundational. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\nWe believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial and operational execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities irrespective of the market environment. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the ability to generate the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital.\nLet me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR - MPLX GP LLC, MPLX LP\n\nThanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Sheila, we are ready for them."

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina. you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of Finance & IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC's capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects stand-alone MPC capital, excluding MPLX. And with that, I'll turn it over Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new director on the MPC Board. Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our Board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft as well as her Board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards.\nAlso like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November and who recently served as CFO for U.S. Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution.\nOur commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96% and our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full year capture.\nOur focus on fostering a low-cost culture enabled us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year. We formed a strategic partnership with Neste, which will enhance the economics of our Martinez renewable fuels project and create a platform for additional collaboration within renewables.\nIn Midstream, our business grew 7% year-over-year. MPLX raised its distribution by 10%. And based on this level, we expect MPC will receive $2 billion of annual distributions. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe that we'll continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unitholders.\nIn 2022, we returned nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with the strong macro environment, led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022.\nBefore Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macro environment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for '23, supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years.\nDemand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust. We have seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic, and we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices.\nUncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential U.S. or global recession and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in '23.\nOur financial priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets for tech to health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\nSecond, our dividend. We're committed to the dividend, which we increased 30% at the end of last year and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth.\nThird, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business. We've been through progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns.\nIn traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez renewable project as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions.\nIn addition, we're focused on growth opportunities in emerging technologies as well as opportunities enabled by digital transformation. Beyond these 3 objectives, we're also returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. In the period from early November through the end of January, we've completed nearly $2.4 billion of share repurchases.\nAnd today, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through-cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital and delivering superior returns to our shareholders.\nWe also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish.\nAs we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewable fuels facility is progressing start-up activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023.\nPretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of '23, which will enable the facility to ramp up through its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bring in more advantaged feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce.\nWe've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Viatris and Cincinnati. We'll continue to look for opportunities, leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM. As evidence of our progress on our sustainability goals, this year, MPC was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the fourth consecutive year. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Moving to fourth quarter results. Slide 6 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65. This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline.\nCorporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments. In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our Refining & Marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate costs. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion, and the full year tax rate was 22%.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions.\nMost of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%.\nLooking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels, which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Even with the disruption at the end of the quarter, our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing 2.7 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries.\nSequentially, we saw per barrel margins decline most notably in the West Coast region, while U.S. Gulf Coast margins were relatively flat, supported by export demand. Capture was 109%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team. Operating expenses were lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower energy cost, partially offset by a special compensation expense of approximately $0.15 per barrel paid in recognition for our employees' contributions due to lower throughputs in the quarter, refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full year refining operating cost per barrel is $5.41. When we compare to 2021 refining operating cost per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs. We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable.\nSlide 9 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds, improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture.\nWe do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter. As our strategic pillar indicates, we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage.\nHistorically, we communicated a capture target of 95%, but over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date and will produce results that can be seen in our financials.\nSlide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our midstream segment delivered resilient fourth quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC.\nSlide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was [$4.4 billion] in the quarter. Working capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices, offset by benefits from inventory impacts.\nCapital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progressed on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay.\nWhile not reflected in the 2022 capital spend due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter.\nMPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November. For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout.\nThis was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval, demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nSlide 12 provides our capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance. Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million, split between low carbon and traditional projects.\nWithin low carbon, $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project.\nIn 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million. And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project, $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost.\nIn marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands. This morning, MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million.\nTheir plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 13, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day, representing 88% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due to turnaround impacts in our U.S. Gulf Coast region.\nPlanned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $350 million in the first quarter with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. The remaining scope of the STAR project, specifically 40,000 barrels per day of crude and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity is expected to be tied in during the turnaround at Galveston Bay in the first quarter and should begin to ramp starting in the second quarter of 2023.\nWe expect the level of 2023 turnaround spending to be similar to the level of spend in 2022. However, unlike 2022, we expect turnaround activity to be front-half weighted this year with significant planned work in the first and second quarters.\nTherefore, we will have executed 4 consecutive quarters of heavy turnaround work. Operating cost per barrel in the first quarter are expected to be flat at $5.60 per barrel for the quarter. In conjunction with our turnarounds, we anticipate higher project-related expenses as we utilize our planned downtime to complete other work planned.\nWe are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast, our expectations of flat operating costs quarter-to-quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently.\nAs we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating cost per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our 3 strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio, we believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits which will enable us to capture opportunities irrespective of the market environment.\nOur goal is to position MPC as a refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of Finance & IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, Sheila, we're ready for questions."

My name is Casey, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nSounds great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab.\nJoining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce Tim Aydt who will be joining our call as a new Executive Vice President of Refining. Tim has over 37 years of experience in leadership roles across our midstream and refining organizations. Most recently, he was Executive Vice President of Pipelines, Terminals and Marine and Chief Commercial Officer, where he oversaw the business development for the MLP.\nNow turning to the macro environment. Roughly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Yet demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust and continues to grow. In the U.S., demand is still below 2019 pre-COVID levels, and we believe there will be a continued recovery. As supply remains constrained and demand continues to rebound, we maintain a bullish outlook towards the refining environment as we look into 2023.\nOur third quarter results reflect the team's operational and commercial execution as we focused on delivering products for consumers in this very tight market. In our Refining segment, we ran near full rates while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. The commercial team focused on optimizing our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to deliver against strong demand. And despite volatility in the global energy markets, our execution reflects progress towards our goal of improving commercial performance.\nWe normally see seasonal decline at this time of the year but to date, we're not seeing those signs. Strong forward crack spreads and wide salary differentials for 2023 indicate the expectation of a strong refining environment going forward. In the fourth quarter, we're currently running our system at full utilization, except for the planned maintenance activity we have occurring given our back of the year weighted turnaround schedule.\nAside from the Refining business, I want to point out that our Midstream segment earnings continue to grow. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 9% year-over-year in midstream. We've been executing strategic capital investments, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing the portfolio, including advancing several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin. The strength of these cash flows supports MPLX's decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10%. Based on this level, MPC will receive $2 billion of distribution from MPLX annually.\nWe've received questions regarding the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire the outstanding public units. So we want to restate what we said in the past. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions to MPC is $2 billion per year, and we expect that to continue growing. MPLX has continued to demonstrate resilient through-cycle earnings and growing cash flows. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic partnership will continue to be enhanced, and we do not plan to roll up MPLX.\nSwitching to capital allocation, we believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In October, we completed our $15 billion return of capital commitment, repurchasing approximately 30% of MPC's shares outstanding. We're committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total return to shareholders.\nToday, we announced an increase to MPC's quarterly dividend of approximately 30%. In addition, we intend to continue repurchases, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and we expect to commence buybacks in November using the remaining $5 billion repurchase authorization.\nIn early 2000, we shared our 3 strategic areas of focus. They have become part of MPC's DNA embedded in our unwavering commitment to increase profitability, have the best through-cycle cash flow generation and drive long-term value creation. As we focus on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, in September, we closed on our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste. Construction is well underway, and we expect Phase 1 mechanical completion by year-end.\nWe're excited about the partnership with Neste, a global leader in feedstock procurement and renewable fuels production. This joint venture enhances the value of the project by reducing MPC's capital commitment to $0.55 per gallon as well as improving the overall project feedstock slate. Neste has the obligation to bring 80% advantaged feedstock in Phase 2. Due to these improvements, we expect MPC share in the JV EBITDA to be only 25% lower than our original stand-alone case.\nAdditionally, this strategic partnership with Neste creates a platform for collaboration. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage the differentiated knowledge and capabilities of 2 industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution.\nWe continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy and have made progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves. Focusing specifically on the Martinez Renewables project which converts our petroleum refinery into a renewable fuels facility. We anticipate the conversion to result in a 60% reduction of the facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, 70% lower total criteria air pollutants and 1 billion gallons of water saved annually. If you haven't had a chance yet, we invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike.\nMoving to third quarter results. Slide 6 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude 3 items: a $549 million noncash pretax gain related to the contribution of our refining assets to the Martinez Renewables JV, a $509 million noncash gain related to an MPLX third-party contract reclassification and a $28 million LIFO inventory charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was just under $4.5 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $285 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.9 billion of our shares.\nSlide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA and from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down approximately $10 per barrel, reflecting a 25% quarterly decline. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.4 billion. The tax rate is similar to last quarter due to the Refining & Marketing representing a larger component of total earnings.\nMoving to our segment slide results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, we focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet continued strong market demand. Our Refining assets ran at 98% utilization processing over 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. We saw margins decline sequentially across all 3 regions. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile global market. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter. Energy costs were approximately $0.15 per barrel higher in the third quarter, driven by higher natural gas prices. Additionally, we recorded a nonrecurring multiyear property tax assessment of $0.13 per barrel in the third quarter, which we will continue to pursue recovery.\nWe believe the actions we have taken to bring our structural operating cost down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. The cost increases we have seen year-to-date have almost entirely been driven by higher energy costs.\nTurning to Slide 9, which provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter. Market backwardation remained a headwind for the industry but our commercial strategy of selling ahead of product backwardation while keeping inventories optimized, supported our ability to meet demand and capture strong prompt margins. And while not as significant as the previous quarter, secondary product prices were a headwind as they lagged higher light product prices.\nOur ability to capture 97% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile 3 months was in part due to our commercial responses.\nSlide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2022, our Midstream segment demonstrated earnings growth with adjusted EBITDA up approximately 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high-return projects to drive further growth for our midstream business. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX' earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.775 per share and MPC expects to receive $2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and as MPLX grows its free cash flow we believe it will have the capacity to return capital to its unitholders.\nSlide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter, operating cash flow excluding changes in working capital, was just under $4.5 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $1.9 billion headwind for the quarter. This quarter, we made a payment of $2.3 billion for estimated federal income taxes declining crude prices or also a headwind to working capital. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $756 million this quarter. The increased level of capital spending was related to a ramp in activity related to the Martinez Renewables fuels facility conversion and the Galveston Bay store project. The STAR project is expected to be completed early 2023.\nOther cash flow benefits of $790 million is primarily driven by the distribution MPC receipt from the Martinez Renewables JV upon closing on September 21. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $11.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nMoving to Slide 12. We have completed our $15 billion share repurchase commitment, utilizing the proceeds from the Speedway divestiture at an average price of $78, ahead of our commitment of no later than the end of 2022. As you will see today, when our quarterly financials, the 10-Q was published, we were able to complete that early in the month of October. We intend to begin repurchase against our $5 billion outstanding authorization in November, now that our financials are public.\nOn Slide 13, I'd like to walk you through our financial priorities, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We believe the quarterly increase to $0.75 per share we announced today is secured through cycles, competitive with peers and the broader market and leaves opportunity to potentially grow our dividend in the future. We anticipate this dividend will be supplemented with repurchases and we are committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total returns to shareholders. We will evaluate growth opportunities and margin enhancing projects.\nShare repurchases will be used to return excess capital to shareholders, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and will continue to lower our share count. Underpinning these priorities, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation, allowing us to execute our strategy.\nOn Slide 14, we highlight the strength of MPC's balance sheet. We continue to manage our balance sheet through an investment-grade credit profile. At the end of our third quarter, MPC stand-alone gross debt to capital ratio is 21% and which is under our target of a 25% to 30% gross debt-to-capital ratio. MPLX has a leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to EBITDA under its target of 4x. Both businesses have strong balance sheet with leverage ratios under their respective targets.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 15, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing 93% utilization. Utilization is forecast to be lower than third quarter due to planned turnaround activity having a higher impact on crude units in the fourth quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $430 million in the fourth quarter with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. Turnaround activity is reflected in our fourth quarter throughput guidance.\nWe are expecting operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter to be lower projected to be $5.30 per barrel for the quarter. This is primarily driven by expected lower natural gas and energy costs. As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every dollar change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.\nIn closing, we will continue to execute on our 3 strategic pillars, strengthening the competitive performance of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture and improving our commercial performance. We are committed to position MPC as a reliable and efficient energy provider with new investments focused on high-return opportunities supporting the company's evolution, which will position it to lead in an energy diverse future. We will stay steadfast in our plan to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, striving to deliver superior cash returns regardless of market conditions and while ensuring, we safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\nLet me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Maryann. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, can you open up for questions today."

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian, Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investor tab.\nJoining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our operational activity was driven by strong market demand for transportation fuels we manufacture. Demand remains resilient, largely driven by the removal of globally imposed mobility restrictions and the pent-up desire to travel.\nJet fuel demand continued its recovery, up nearly 20% from the same quarter last year, with the increased resumption of travel. Gasoline demand remained very resilient through the quarter in part due to the start of the summer driving season. Diesel demand after a strong beginning to the year, softened a bit in the second quarter due to lower trucking volumes.\nDuring the second quarter, in order to meet robust customer demand, we ran our refining system at full utilization. We optimized our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as possible. Commercially, we optimized around our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to meet this customer demand.\nThis resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 billion as we saw crack spreads this quarter respond to uncertainty in the product markets, driven by the potential for sanction impacts on top of an already tight supply and related inventory levels.\nMaryann will walk you through the details of our results. But looking forward, we expect tight supply, low inventory levels and strong global demand to continue to incentivize high refining runs into the third quarter. We will continue to execute on what we can control running a safe, reliable, low-cost system, improving our commercial performance and strengthening the competitive performance of our assets.\nOn capital allocation, we remain committed to the 4 priorities we previously outlined. First, we're going to take care of our assets by deploying maintenance capital. We want to ensure we can safely operate our assets protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\nSecond, we're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. And as we've stated in the past, once we complete the $15 billion capital return program that resulted from the Speedway sale, we will reassess the level of our dividend.\nThird, we see this as a return on as well as the return of capital business. As we enter the second half of the year, our capital spending outlook remains on track.\nWe continue to progress our Martinez renewable fuels facility with the first phase of the facility currently targeted to be mechanically complete by year-end. Once completed, the facility is expected to be capable of bringing nearly 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel supply into the market.\nWe also expect to be able to close our JV with Neste in the coming months. The time frame for completing the facility and closing the JV are dependent upon the timing of obtaining the air quality permit. We'll continue to look for other opportunities to generate a return on capital such as cost reduction projects and opportunities that build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages to drive returns and shareholder value.\nAnd fourth, after executing against the first 3 objectives, we look to return capital to shareholders. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares. And today, we announced a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In June, we published our annual sustainability report and our annual perspective on climate scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our greenhouse gas reduction targets. And through 2021, we have achieved a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity emissions, and an 11% reduction in our absolute Scope 3, Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur perspectives on climate-related scenarios which is aligned with TCFD standards, provides insight into some of the strategic considerations we take to set meaningful objectives, dedicate resources to accomplish them and then hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate results. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves, which we have been reporting on since 2011. We believe our investors and other interested stakeholders will find that the extensive disclosures in these reports illustrate our company's financial strength, adaptiveness and resilience to climate-related risks.\nMoving to second quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $230 million benefit related to changes in the 2020 and 2021 RVO requirements published by the EPA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $9.1 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was almost $7 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $313 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since our last earnings call.\nSlide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2022 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially and driven primarily by an approximately $6.4 billion increase from Refining & Marketing. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.8 billion. The tax rate is higher this last quarter due to refining end marketing representing a larger component of earnings in the quarter.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, our R&M team was focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet market demand. Refining ran at 100% utilization processing approximately 2.9 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries safely and reliably. This is the same level of throughput achieved back in 2019 pre-pandemic before the closures of Gallup and Martinez.\nCapture was 96%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile market. Operating expenses were higher in the second quarter, driven primarily by natural gas prices, which were approximately $3 per MMBtu higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter.\nWhile we have been able to mitigate some of the impact of higher prices, the cost increase we have seen in the first half of the year has been almost entirely driven by higher energy cost. We continue to believe the cost reductions we made to bring our structural operating costs down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. With higher natural gas prices, we would expect operating costs to remain elevated in the third quarter. Distribution costs were modestly higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter due to higher refinery utilization, which resulted in higher system volumes.\nTurning to Slide 8, which provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, our capture results this quarter were impacted by a few key factors. Secondary products continue to be a headwind as prices lag higher light product prices. This was partially offset by strong gasoline and distillate margins as well as higher volumetric gain due to higher product prices.\nProduct backwardation created a headwind during part of the quarter. But during this time, we were able to leverage our robust logistics capabilities to translate a portion of our physical barrels into the market on a more prompt basis. And our ability to capture 96% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile 3 months was in part due to our commercial responses.\nSlide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Performance is underpinned by strong operations and a commitment to strict capital discipline.\nMPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant capital to its unitholders. Today, MPLX announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchase authorization.\nSlide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $7 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was roughly flat for the quarter as we saw benefits from an increase in crude oil payables related to higher refining throughput, offset by a build in crude oil inventories. Since the first quarter of 2021, working capital related to increasing prices has been a source of cash flow.\nCapital expenditures and investments totaled $546 million this quarter. We continue to spend on our STAR project, which is projected to increase crude capacity at the Galveston Bay refinery by 40,000 barrels per day. This project is expected to be completed early 2023. We are progressing the conversion of Martinez renewable fuel facility and expect the first phase to be mechanically complete by year-end.\nDuring the quarter, MPC returned $313 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion worth of shares. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $13.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our objective has been to complete the $15 billion repurchase program no later than the end of this year. We remain on track to meet this commitment. Upon completion of the program, we will reassess our dividend level.\nSince the launch of this program in May 2021, we have repurchased approximately 12.1 billion shares at an average share price of approximately $74 per share. Over this time, we have reduced MPC share count by approximately 162 million shares or over 24%. We've received the Board's approval for a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll work through our capital allocation priorities and continue to assess the market environment to determine how we might execute against this authorization.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day representing 94% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than second quarter due to higher planned turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the third quarter with activity spread across all 3 regions.\nAs we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our planned turnaround activity is back half weighted for 2022. Turnaround activity is reflected in our third quarter throughput guidance we expect this elevated level of activity may reduce our light product yields. We'll optimize to minimize the impacts, but we think our capture rate for the third quarter could be lower than the second quarter.\nIn coordinating maintenance work, we'll always try to maximize turnaround and catalyst cycles to the economic optimum, but we also do not compromise on safety or asset integrity and ensure work is scheduled to achieve this balance Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. We are expecting higher operating costs in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by the elevated cost of natural gas as well as slightly higher project expense work, which we normally coordinate to occur during turnarounds to limit the impact on throughput reduction.\nAs a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity of approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.\nIn closing, we will continue to optimize our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as demand requires. We remain committed to advancing our low-cost initiatives and focused on areas to drive continued commercial outperformance, and we will stay steadfast in our plan to execute against our capital allocation priorities to drive shareholder value.\nLet me turn the call back to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Maryann. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we're ready for the questions."

My name is Elan, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on the website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab.\nJoining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. Year-over-year, demand trends have been, for the most part, positive and the market seems to have reached a post-COVID point of stability. Distillate remains stable, Jet continues to recover, and Gasoline has been more resilient than we would have expected given normal seasonality and recent geopolitical events.\nThe biggest factor outside of our control is changes in global supply and demand. At the end of 2021, Global light product inventories were already tight. Sanctions and boycotts following the Russian invasion of Ukraine have increased supply uncertainties. Product margins have risen to cover the higher cost structure of marginal supply particularly in European regions where there's a high reliance on Russian natural gas.\nWe expect continued volatility in 2022 with an advantage for safe, reliable and low-cost operators. We are focused on optimizing our maintenance schedules to maximize uptime and allow us to do what we can to produce volumes to meet the market demand. As we do this, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.\nWith this in mind, we anticipate the U.S. refining system running at higher utilization rates in the coming quarters to meet rising demand. MPC's first quarter results reflect the continued recovery for our products and services which supported higher margins and higher throughput across regions. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. We repurchased $2.8 billion in shares in the quarter. And since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. Through today, we've completed 80% of our initial $10 billion capital return commitment.\nI would also like to highlight the strength of MPLX in our portfolio. Last year, MPC received $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant cash to MPC and its public unitholders. Another milestone in our sustainability objectives was the joint venture agreement with Neste for the Martinez Renewable Fuels project.\nThis strategic partnership with Neste enhances our Martinez project by leveraging our complementary strengths and expertise. The project will utilize existing process infrastructure, diverse inbound and outbound logistics and is optimally located to support California's LCFS goals while strengthening MPC's footprint in renewable fuels. Our intended partnership with Neste also creates a platform for additional collaboration within renewables.\nWe believe there will be opportunities to leverage this partnership between 2 industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution and the goal of leading in sustainable energy. MPC will manage project execution and operate the facility once construction is complete. Additionally, MPLX Logistics assets support Martinez will remain owned and operated by MPLX. We are progressing through the permit process. Contra Costa County certified the Environmental Impact Report for the Martinez project, and we're hopeful that the county will shortly provide final approval. We remain excited about the prospects of the project and its ability to deliver low carbon intensity fuels to support California's climate goals.\nShifting to Slide 5, we focus on challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. In February, we became the first among our peers to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. The new Scope 3 target further enhances MPC's disclosures in addition to our existing Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets.\nMPLX also established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity from natural gas gathering and processing operations by 75% below 2016 levels. In the second quarter, we will publish our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports and provide updates on the progress on the goals we have previously said. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the first quarter results.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.49. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was $1.9 billion, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $330 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion in shares, which takes us to $2.5 billion repurchased since our last earnings call. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, driven primarily by $175 million decrease from refining and marketing. The tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which reflects the benefits from the public portion of MPLX net income, which is not taxable to MPC. Moving to our segment results.\nSlide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported strong first quarter earnings with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion. Utilization was 91% for the quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower production which was primarily the result of unplanned downtime in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we experienced 2 unplanned outages. In the beginning of February, the Galveston Bay refinery experienced a citywide power loss, which resulted in a complete plant outage. Later in the month as we were bringing our Garyville refinery back to service following turnaround activities a fire occurred near our hydrocracker unit. The unit was repaired and returned to service after about 3 weeks.\nBoth of these events resulted in approximately $200 million of lost profit opportunity. Margin headwinds in the quarter were a result of the lower capture of 84% that we experienced this quarter and were primarily realized in the Gulf and West Coast. Operating expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower planned project expense as well as a lower average natural gas price coupled with lower energy consumption compared to the fourth quarter. Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter, averaging over $0.70 in MMBtu higher in March than in January. In April, natural gas prices averaged $6.70 in MMBtu or nearly 80% higher than the average price in 2021. The current forward strip for Henry Hub is around $8 for the rest of the year, so we would expect natural gas to be a headwind as the year progresses.\nNatural gas is an input cost for our refineries, which historically has represented approximately 15% of our operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs were lower in the first quarter due to lower product volumes.\nTurning to Slide 9. We want to directly address the refining and marketing capture this quarter. In the first quarter, our capture result was 84%. A few factors drove the majority of the headwinds secondary and light product margins, impacts associated with inventory builds and associated derivative views to manage volatility and to a lesser extent, Gulf Coast refinery outages impacted our yields.\nSlide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was an approximate $600 million source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices, partially offset by increases in crude and product inventory. In March, MPLX issued $1.5 billion worth of long-term debt, utilizing a large portion of the proceeds to repay the borrowings under the intercompany loan with MPC.\nDuring the quarter, MPC returned $330 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares. Now 80% complete with our initial $10 billion capital return commitment, we could begin using the $5 billion incremental authorization starting in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nLast week, we held our Annual General Meeting, which concluded our proxy season, we appreciate the engagement from our investors as we work to create shareholder value, focus on sustainability and position ourselves to deliver results in an energy diverse future.\nTurning to guidance. On Slide 12, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day, representing 95% utilization. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the second quarter. Expected activity is relatively light and spread through all 3 regions.\nAs Mike mentioned, our optimized turnaround schedule in the second quarter is expected to allow us to run our assets safely and reliably at high utilization as we remain focused on supplying the products and services markets are demanding. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. Earlier in the call, we shared our natural gas sensitivity, the increase we are currently seeing for natural gas costs are reflected in our second quarter guidance, on top of our average baseline $5 per barrel of operating cost.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million. As we look at the impact of inflation on full year results, the 2 areas of focus are wages and certain supply chain inputs. However, we have identified incremental sustainable cost reductions that we are executing against to offset these costs.\nNotwithstanding all of that, we will continue to identify the headwind from rising energy cost to our refining system throughout the year. Slide 13 provides our capital investment plan for 2022. Once we have closed on the Martinez JV, MPC will receive $400 million and be reimbursed for 50% of the capital spent to date. After the JV is closed, MPC will be responsible for its 50% share of the capital spend going forward, and Neste will be responsible for its 50% share. The total cost for the Martinez refinery conversion is still expected to be $1.2 billion and MPC's net cost will be reduced to approximately $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update once we have closed the JV. As a reminder, ongoing growth projects in our Refining and Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast, and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and ARCO marketing brand.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\n(Operator Instructions) Operator, we'll now open the call."

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me today on the call are Mike Hennigan, CEO; and Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects stand-alone MPC capital, excluding MPLX.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Hennigan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Kristina, and good morning, and thanks for joining our call.\nBefore we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. During the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in Omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well. And on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records. While jet demand reach post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.\nWhen we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact. Based on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand. Light product inventories remain tight and U.S. demand continues to recover, we believe that refining margins will be well positioned for 2022.\nOn the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares. That puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program. Further reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization. This brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.\nToday, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook. We expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion. Total costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion. Approximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023. This competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.\nAt Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021. We remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction. Our plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.\nWe've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance. Our strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures and alliances, all of which are common in this space. A recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM. We're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the 2 facilities. We remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.\nOn Kenai, we have been working a sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share. In 2021, we progressed all 3 of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution. On the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven.\nOur Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation. We made 2 strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility. And this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.\nAs we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.\nFinally, on commercial. While I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio. In March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan. In December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickenson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.\nAnd in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant. We converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.\nOur team's execution on these 3 strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.\nShifting to Slide 5. We remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy. We have 3 company-wide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well. In the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results.\n\nMaryann T. Mannen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, TechnipFMC Plc\n\nThanks, Mike.\nSlide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.27 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30. Adjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pretax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.\nBeginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.\nFinally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.\nSlide 7 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure over the past 2 years. As we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things. We will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets. And we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.\nSince the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Our refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel. While we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5. Additionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.\nHowever, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. This improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom line profitability and upcycles.\nTurning to Slide 8. We would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022. First, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we're committed to the dividend. As we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.\nThird, we continue to believe this is both a return on and return of capital business and we will continue to invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that are resilient and reduce cost. In renewables, current spend is primarily focused on our Martinez renewable fuel conversion. We believe that share repurchases can be used to meaningfully return capital to shareholders.\nIn order to successfully execute the strategies guided by these priorities, MPC needs a strong balance sheet as a foundation. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.\nMoving to another key focus area. Slide 9 highlights our focus on strict capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2022 capital outlook for MPC. MPC's 2022 capital investment plan totals approximately $1.7 billion. As we continue to focus on strict capital discipline, our overall spend remains approximately 30% below 2019 spending levels. Sustaining capital is approximately 20% of capital spend, underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance.\nOf the remaining 80% for growth, approximately 50% of this $1.3 billion supports the conversion of Martinez into a renewable fuels facility. The remainder of the growth capital is for other projects already underway. At our refineries, the growth capital is primarily for projects that enhance returns at MPC's large coastal assets with a focus on completing Galveston Bay Star project as well as smaller projects at Garyville and Los Angeles. Going forward, we expect growth capital will continue to have a significant portion for renewables and projects that will help us reduce future operating costs.\nSlide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by a $354 million increase from Refining & Marketing. The adjustment column reflects $132 million of pretax charges for make-whole premiums for debt redemption during the quarter, which has also been excluded from the interest column.\nMoving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported continued improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased $354 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions.\nU.S. Gulf Coast production increased by 14%, recovering from storm-related downtime last quarter and solid margin per barrel increased 31% due to higher export sales and higher sales of light product inventory. The West Coast margin per barrel increased 40% associated with increased demand and refinery outages. Utilization was 94% for the quarter, slightly improved from the third quarter. The higher Gulf Coast throughput was offset by lower throughput in the Mid-Con for planned turnaround activity.\nOperating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. There was also higher routine maintenance and planned project expense. Additionally, we saw natural gas prices softened during the quarter, coming off highs in the $5 to $6 range and ending in the $3 to $4 range.\nSlide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.\nSlide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion in the quarter. This excludes changes in working capital and also excludes the cash we received for our CARES tax refund in the quarter, which was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash and is included in the income tax part of the chart. Working capital was an approximate $1.3 billion source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by a reduction in crude and product inventory.\nAs we announced on last quarter's call, MPC redeemed $2.1 billion in senior notes in December. Under income taxes, we received approximately $1.6 billion of our CARES tax refund in the fourth quarter. We also used about $300 million to offset against our Speedway tax obligation. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect in the first half of 2022. We paid approximately $1.2 billion for our Speedway income tax obligation. All that remains is about $50 million of state and local taxes.\nWith respect to capital return during the quarter, MPC returned $354 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.7 billion worth of shares. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nSlide 14 provides our capital investment plan for 2022 which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.7 billion. The plan includes $1.6 billion for Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $300 million or roughly 20% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.\nOur growth capital plan is approximately $1.3 billion, split between renewables and ongoing projects. Within renewable spending, the majority is allocated for the Martinez conversion. Ongoing projects in our refining and marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and Arco marketing brands.\nAlso included is approximately $100 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs and capture commercial value.\nThis morning, MPLX also announced their 2022 capital investment plan of $900 million. Their plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of their share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.\nOn Slide 15, we review our progress on our return of capital. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of company shares. This puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion repurchase program commitment, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining. We remain committed to complete the $10 billion program by the end of 2022. And as we are ahead of pace given our recent repurchases, could foresee completion sooner than initially planned.\nAs part of our long-term commitment to return capital, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization today, increasing our recent repurchase authorizations to $15 billion. We plan to continue using open market repurchase programs, although all of the programs we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete our commitment. We intend to use programs that allow us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings call.\nAs we have said many times, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation allowing us to execute our strategy. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points about our balance sheet.\nMPC ended the year with approximately $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. But longer term, we believe that we will need to maintain about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will always ensure that we have enough liquidity to endure market fluctuations.\nCurrently, we have a $5 billion bank revolver that is undrawn. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade profile. At year-end, MPC's gross debt-to-capital ratio is 21% and our long-term gross debt-to-capital target is approximately 30%. As we continue to execute our share repurchase program, we will see that ratio increase. After the recent redemption in December, our current structural debt is approximately $6.5 billion, and we do not have any maturities until 2024.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 17, we provide our first quarterly outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the first quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Gulf Coast region. Our 2022 planned turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.\nTotal operating costs are projected to be $5.10 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.\n\nKristina Anna Kazarian\n\nVP of IR, Marathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nThanks, Maryann. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we'll open it to questions."

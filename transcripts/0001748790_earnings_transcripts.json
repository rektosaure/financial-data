I would now like to turn the call over to Tracey Whitehead Head of Investor Relations . You may begin .\n\nThank you . Operator and thank you , everyone for joining Amcor's fiscal 2026 first quarter earnings call . Joining today is Peter Konetzni , Chief Executive Officer and Michael Casamento Chief Financial Officer .\n\nBefore I hand over a few items to note on our website , Amcor plc under the investor section , you'll find today's press release and presentation , which we will discuss .\n\nPlease be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release . And presentation . Remarks will also include forward looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions .\n\nThe second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future earnings to be different than current estimates and reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings , including our statements on form 10-K and 10-q .\n\nFor further details . Please note that during the question and answer session , we request that you limit yourself to a single question and then rejoin the queue .\n\nIf you have any additional questions or follow ups . With that , over to you , pick .\n\nThank you Tracy , and thank you to everyone joining us . I'm excited to welcome you today to discuss our first full quarter operating as a combined company , we're 180 days in , and I pleased with our teams have come together to integrate and execute against our priorities .\n\nWe're also seeing strong and consistent validation by our customers , who are very receptive to our expanded offerings and innovation capabilities . We're now experiencing the quality of the combined business as the global leader in consumer packaging and dispensing solutions for nutrition , healthcare and beauty and wellness .\n\nWe're gaining momentum. Margins increased in both operating segments, and we are addressing identified non-core assets to enhance focus on our core business.\n\nAdjusted EPs of 19.3 cents per share was above the midpoint of our guidance range , increasing 18% compared with last year . This includes the addition of the Barry business and was supported by disciplined cost performance , improved productivity and synergy delivery toward the upper end of our expected range .\n\nOur synergy run rate continues to build and we have clear line of sight to opportunities that will drive at least 260 million in synergy benefits in fiscal 26 .\n\nWe're confident in delivering a year of strong earnings and free cash flow growth . This is an exciting time for Amcor , and I look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to create an even stronger business that delivers significant long term value for our shareholders and is the global packaging partner of choice for our customers .\n\nNow moving to slide three and safety , which has always been a core value for legacy , Amcor and Barry as a combined company .\n\nOur focus on safety remains absolute and fiscal 26 has started well with strong performance for Q1 . Our industry leading safety metrics continue with Amcor's total recordable incident rate at 0.55 .\n\nThis is a slight increase compared with last year's performance , which is typically the case when we acquire a business . We have already identified opportunities for improvement across our now much broader footprint and global workforce , and we are proud that 89% of our combined sites remained injury free in Q1 .\n\nSlide four highlights our key messages for today , which align with our near-term priorities , delivering on the core business , integrating Barry , realizing synergies and optimizing our portfolio .\n\nFirst , core business execution . As mentioned , we executed well in the first quarter with EPs above midpoint of guidance . This positions us well to achieve our full year financial objectives , including earnings per share , growth of 12 to 17% and doubling free cash flow over fiscal 25 .\n\nSecond, integration momentum remains strong. We delivered $38 million in synergies during the quarter, which was toward the upper end of our guidance range.\n\nIn addition to strong cost and financial synergies , we have already secured revenue synergies totaling more than 70 million in annualized sales . And our strong pipeline continues to build this performance .\n\nCombined with our track record of executing synergy targets from prior large integrations, this reinforces our confidence in delivering a total of $650 million in synergies through fiscal 2028, including at least $260 million in fiscal 2026.\n\nThird , we're addressing previously identified non-core assets and have entered into agreements to sell two businesses for combined proceeds of approximately 100 million .\n\nWhile these businesses are small , this swift progress underscores our commitment to disciplined portfolio management . We continue to review options to accelerate actions on non-core assets , and we anticipate additional actions this fiscal year .\n\nFourth , we are reaffirming our fiscal 26 guidance . Importantly , Amcor is well positioned with significant earnings and cash flow growth expected through delivery of 260 million synergies , largely under our control and not impacted by divestment of non-core assets .\n\nThis means achieving our guidance for 12 to 17% EPs growth this year is not dependent on improvements in the macroeconomic environment or in customer or consumer demand .\n\nAnd fifth , the board has approved an increase in quarterly dividend to $0.13 per share . Turning now to slide five . And our first quarter financial results .\n\nAs Michael will cover in more detail ahead of our segment commentary , we've moved quickly to operate as a unified organization . As a result , our commentary is focused on the year over year performance of the combined business .\n\nFiscal year 26 is off to a good start as our business has benefited from disciplined cost , performance , improved productivity and delivery of cost and financial synergies , while also building a pipeline of revenue synergies .\n\nFirst quarter EPs of 19.3 cents per share was above the midpoint of our guidance range , growing 18% on a constant currency basis .\n\nExcluding non-core North America, beverage overall volumes were broadly similar to Q4, down approximately 2% in the quarter and in line with our expectations.\n\nEmerging markets performed better than developed markets , led by solid growth in Asia and Ebit of 687 million was up approximately 4% on a comparable basis .\n\nAs our teams continue to proactively manage and flex costs . These actions , along with the enhanced quality of the combined business , resulted in another quarter of strong margin expansion with reported Ebit margin of 12% , 110 basis points higher than Umbro's reported margin last year .\n\nAnd 50 basis points higher than combined companies comparable margin last year . Moving to slide six , which shows we are in track relative to our one and three year synergy commitments .\n\nOur teams delivered 38 million synergies during the quarter , which was toward the high end of our guidance range . Approximately 33 million of those synergies benefited Ebit and came from G&A and procurement savings , with the remaining 5 million preliminarily , preliminary primarily , excuse me , related to interest headcount reductions now exceed 450 .\n\nAnd discussions with our vendors and suppliers are progressing well . Our procurement savings and opportunity pipeline continued to build . We are also off to a fast start on revenue synergies , which I will return to shortly .\n\nOur teams are executing well against our proven integration playbook , positioning the business to deliver strong earnings growth in fiscal 26 . We're confident in delivering at least $260 million in synergies this year , and 650 million in total through fiscal 28 .\n\nToday , we have reaffirmed both targets before turning the call over to Michael . I want to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be his final earnings call .\n\nAs Amcor CFO , as he has decided to return to Australia to spend more time with his family . Michael has been an exceptional partner to me and to the business , and we thank him for his many contributions over the past decade .\n\nHe will continue with Amcor in an advisory capacity through June , working closely with our teams to support smooth transition . We look forward to welcoming Steve Scherger , who will join Amcor as CFO next week .\n\nSteve brings deep industry expertise and a strong understanding of both the US and global packaging markets . We are fortunate to have an executive of his caliber and reputation join our leadership team , and we're confident that his insights and experience will further strengthen our ability to deliver value for customers and shareholders .\n\nMichael , over to you ."

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Whitehead, you may begin.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over a few items to note. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in those materials. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation there's several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details.\n[Operator Instructions] With that, over to you, PK.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Tracey, and thank you to everyone joining us today. I would like to start by highlighting that this has been a significant milestone quarter for Amcor. We completed the acquisition of Berry Global and are now 100 days into combining 2 complementary businesses, and transforming Amcor's ability to create value for our customers and shareholders. Our efforts are reflected in our expectation to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 17% in fiscal '26, with free cash flow expected to double to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.\nSignificant work was done ahead of close and integration efforts kicked off quickly on day 1. Feedback from customers has been positive and leadership teams are in place across the organization. We're executing against our synergy work plans, and we have undertaken the strategic portfolio review discussed on prior calls. In short, we are creating a stronger business that is well positioned to deliver higher levels of consistent organic growth and long-term shareholder value.\nTurning to Slide 3 and safety. Similar to Amcor, safety has always been a core value for Berry. Both companies have a long history of excellent execution in providing a safe workplace, and this remains our #1 priority. For fiscal '25, Amcor's Total Recordable Incident Rate, TRIR, was 0.27, and 68% of our sites remained injury-free for the entire year. For the 2 months of May and June, Berry's TRIR was 0.57. Our commitment to providing and sustaining a safe working environment remains absolute.\nSlide 4 outlines our key messages for today, and these are aligned with our near-term priorities to deliver on the base, integrate and capture synergies and optimize the portfolio. First, in terms of results. With 2 months contribution from Berry, Q4 shows a step-up to a high level of quarterly net sales EBITDA and EBIT for Amcor. Second, integration is progressing well. Synergy realization is tracking to plan, and we remain confident in delivering $650 million in total synergies through fiscal '28, including $260 million in fiscal '26.\nThird, we have now conducted a strategic review of our combined portfolio, primarily focused on defining our core portfolio. Going forward, Amcor is the global leader in consumer packaging and dispensing solutions for nutrition and health. As part of this review, we also identified businesses that are less aligned with our core portfolio. And for these, we will explore alternatives to maximize value. Most importantly, our fiscal '26 guidance reflects expectations for a year of strong earnings and cash flow growth, largely driven by self-help actions.\nTurning to Slide 5 and our fourth quarter results. While the acquisition of Berry drives strong increases across several financial metrics, the performance of both legacy businesses fell short of our expectations for two reasons. First, and consistent with broader market data, we experienced sequentially weaker volumes for our consumers and customers in both our Flexibles and Rigid Packaging solutions segments through the quarter, particularly in North America. Overall volume performance across both legacy businesses was similar and on a combined basis were 1.7% lower than last year compared to our expectations for relatively flat.\nSecond, in addition to lower volumes, earnings in the North American beverage business were negatively impacted by operating challenges at a few high-volume sites, which resulted in higher costs. Michael will speak more to the nature of the challenges, but let me just say here that we are comprehensively addressing the performance of this business. On that point, we have taken advantage of the Amcor and Berry combined platform to divide the legacy Amcor Rigid Packaging business in its 3 parts. North American beverage is now being run as a separate dedicated beverage business unit with new and focused management. We're addressing the operating challenges, and we will be improving efficiency across the network. Amcor's legacy specialty containers business is now integrated with the legacy Berry business in North America, confirming an excellent product and technology fit. And in Latin America, the legacy Rigid Packaging and Flexibles businesses are being combined to create scale and synergies in the region.\nBefore turning over to Michael to cover the results, I'd like to talk about the progress we've made over the last 100 days, integrating the Berry and Amcor businesses and the work we have done to define our core portfolio. Beginning with Slide 6 and integration. First and foremost, we have quickly engaged with customers around the world, highlighting the many benefits and new opportunities this combination creates.\nFeedback has been very positive. And already, we have seen additional business wins directly linked to combining the product portfolio, operations and capabilities of our legacy businesses. As an example, legacy Amcor is now providing membrane [indiscernible] for coffee capsules supplied by legacy Berry, thereby offering a packaging solution rather than individual packaging components. This is a great early example of the opportunity discussed when we announced the merger.\nFrom a G&A cost synergy perspective, we have moved fast to begin eliminating duplication, lowering headcount by more than 200 until now. In terms of operations and footprints, we have been combining assets, identifying open capacity, repatriating outsourced film supply and transferring production volumes across the network to improve efficiency and lower cost. While still in the very early stages, we have closed 1 site, approved closure of 4 additional sites, and we are making good progress on further footprint actions.\nLooking at procurement. We have combined spend data within one platform to provide full transparency, access and real-time insight across the function globally. And our teams have worked extensively with our direct and indirect suppliers in all regions, validating the synergy pipeline and delivering quick wins, which will benefit earnings from the first quarter of fiscal '26.\nI'm happy with the progress we've made over the first 100 days, bringing our two companies together, and feel good about how we are executing against our proven integration playbook and setting the business up to drive strong earnings growth in fiscal '26. We're confident in delivering $260 million synergies in fiscal '26 and a total of $650 million through fiscal '28, and we are reaffirming both targets today.\nSlide 7 profiles Amcor's core combined portfolio. These are large, stable end markets with attractive growth and margin profiles where we have leadership positions and room to grow. Approximately 75% of sales come from advanced solutions requiring innovation and 50% of sales are generated from focus categories, which I come back to shortly.\nSlide 8 shows our unique and expanded product portfolio with Flexibles and Rigid Packaging solutions to address the varied needs of our customers in these sizable end markets. This view also again highlights the complementary nature of this combination with both companies bringing different capabilities and product strength to create a stronger customer offering than either could do on a stand-alone basis. We already have leading positions in these categories and plenty of room to grow given the fragmented nature of these markets.\nSlide 9 further identifies 6 focus end market categories, which we have spoken about previously and collectively represent approximately $10 billion or 50% of core portfolio sales. Each has higher than average growth rates historically supported by long-term consumer trends and a requirement for complex packaging solutions. We are already winning in these attractive categories, and are now better positioned with enhanced scale, capabilities and solutions.\nTurning to Slide 10. As part of the portfolio review, we have also identified several businesses with combined annual sales of approximately $2.5 billion that are less aligned with our go-forward core portfolio for one or more reasons. They may have a different growth of margin profile that the business operates in an industry with relatively low barriers to entry or where Amcor may not see a clear pathway to becoming a leading supplier at scale. For these businesses, we will explore alternatives to maximize value, which may include restructuring, partnership or JV ownership models, cash sales or a combination thereof. These actions will enhance focus on our core portfolio, result in higher levels of more consistent organic growth and create value for shareholders.\nOur $1.5 billion North America beverage business has been placed in this group. And over the next few quarters, we will execute against the work plan I mentioned earlier to strengthen the performance of this business before exploring alternatives. We will remain disciplined as we work through these processes, and there is no definite timeline for completion. However, we do expect to make progress in some of the smaller assets in fiscal '26.\nLooking forward, and as you will hear from Michael, when he covers our fiscal '26 guidance, Amcor is now a stronger business, and we are taking the right strategic actions to build on our foundation for creating long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.Thanks, PK, and hello, everyone. Before getting into further detail of financial performance for Q4, a couple of things to note. Firstly, a reminder that the reported Q4 financial results include 3 months contribution from the legacy Amcor business and 2 months contribution from the legacy Berry business. Second, as PK mentioned earlier, we moved swiftly to operate as a unified organization, making decisions and managing the business on a combined basis. This included optimizing our network by reallocating volumes to better balance supply and demand. And as a result, while both legacy businesses saw a similar overall volume performance in May and June, our volume commentary will be primarily focused on year-over-year performance on a combined basis.\nStarting with the Global Flexible Packaging Solutions segment on Slide 11, which includes Amcor's large-scale Flexible Packaging business and Berry's Flexible business from the 1st of May 2025, Volumes for the combined businesses were down approximately 1.5%. By region, demand in North America was weaker than anticipated, with volumes down low single-digit primarily reflecting softer demand in unconverted film as well as in categories such as snacks and confectionary that can be a little more discretionary.\nAcross all other regions, volumes were broadly in line with the prior year, with continued growth across Latin America and Asia, including in Brazil and China, offsetting modestly lower volumes in Europe.\nFrom an end market perspective, we delivered another quarter of solid growth across several focus categories. Health care, protein, including meat and dairy, and liquids delivered low to mid-single-digit volume increases, supported in part by market share gains and pet care was strong. These gains were more than offset by softer volumes in other categories, including unconverted film, snacks and confectionary and home & personal care, which generally fall into our niche application and nutrition value categories.\nOverall, net sales increased by 18% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the acquisition of Berry along with favorable price/mix trends. And adjusted EBIT of $450 million was up 11% on a constant currency basis, largely driven by approximately $50 million of acquired earnings, net of divestments, with the remaining variance reflecting an unfavorable price/mix, partly offset by cost benefits. EBIT margin remained solid at 14.1%.\nTurning to Slide 12 in the Global Rigid Packaging Solutions segment, which includes Amcor's legacy Rigid Packaging business along with Berry's larger scale consumer packaging in North America and Consumer Packaging International businesses from the 1st of May 2025. Overall net sales increased by 121% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the acquisition of Berry. Rigid Packaging Solutions saw similar combined volume trends to those I just mentioned for Flexibles, down approximately 2% and down 1% excluding North America beverage.\nAs noted earlier, our performance in the quarter reflects ongoing soft consumer and customer demand primarily in the United States. Outside of the U.S., volumes in Europe were in line with the prior year and modestly higher in Latin America. By category, volumes grew low single digits across health care, and foodservice was in line with last year, offset by low single-digit volume declines within beauty and wellness and specialty categories. Volumes across a broad range of food and beverage end markets were in line with last year.\nAdjusted EBIT came in at $204 million, up 173% on a constant currency basis, and this was driven by approximately $150 million of acquired Berry Global earnings net of divested earnings from the December 2024 Berry kept joint venture sale, with the remaining variation largely reflecting lower North American beverage earnings.\nTurning to more details on North American beverage. As mentioned, volumes came in below our expectations entering the quarter. And in addition, we experienced operating challenges at high-volume sites, which resulted in elevated costs through the quarter, including higher freight costs to service out of region supply, higher labor costs and lower fixed cost absorption. As PK mentioned, we have developed a detailed plan to address current challenges and have already taken a number of actions. While we expect these measures will lead to better operational performance through fiscal '26, we anticipate the cost base for North America beverage will remain elevated in Q1.\nEBIT margin for Global Rigid Packaging Solutions was 10.9%, a new level of performance based on our acquisition of Berry. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 13. Annual adjusted free cash flow of $926 million was within the guidance range provided in April. And as usual, cash generation and conversion was strongest in the fourth quarter of the year. CapEx for the year was $580 million, up from last year, driven primarily by the addition of Berry for the 2 months. We anticipate capital spending in the range of $850 million to $900 million in fiscal '26, with associated depreciation expected to be slightly above CapEx levels.\nTurning to leverage. Leverage was 3.5x exiting the quarter, taking into account combined annual earnings, and we expect leverage to fall to approximately 3.1 to 3.2x over the next 12 months. This excludes the benefit of any proceeds received from asset sales through fiscal '26, which would enable us to deliver further.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2026 on Slide 14, which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not reflect the completion of any portfolio optimization actions. We anticipate a year of strong EPS and cash flow growth, and we are confident we will realize significant synergies from the Berry acquisition. We are not factoring in a meaningful rebound in consumer demand, which we believe is a prudent approach given the current macroeconomic environment and ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their potential impact on customers and end consumers.\nAs such, we currently anticipate broadly flat volumes for FY '26. We expect adjusted earnings per share of between $0.80 to $0.83 on a reported basis, representing strong year-over-year growth between 12% and 17%.\nOur confidence in delivering 12% earnings growth in FY '26 -- our confidence in delivering at least 12% earnings growth in FY '26 is based on self-help in executing against our identified synergies of $260 million.\nIn terms of phasing for the fiscal year, we expect approximately 42% to 45% of earnings will be delivered in the first half, with more weighting to the second half, particularly Q4 as our synergy run rate will build through the year. For Q1, we expect EPS to be between $0.18 and $0.20 per share, including approximately $35 million to $40 million of pre-tax synergies, which represents 8% growth compared with adjusted EPS of $0.162 per share last year. And we expect earnings from the combined base businesses to be broad -- the base business to be broadly in line with the prior year based on our expectation that the demand environment will remain challenged.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we expect free cash flow to double over fiscal '25 to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in FY '26, which is after deducting approximately $220 million of cash integration and transaction costs. Net interest expense is expected to be in the range between $570 million and $600 million, and we anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 21%. So in summary for me, we're excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to execute with discipline.\nSo with that, I'll hand back to you, PK.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Michael. I want to leave you with a few closing thoughts prior to opening the call for questions. We have several levers under our control that will lead to strong earnings growth over the next several years. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $260 million in synergies this fiscal year and a cumulative total of $650 million by the end of '28, reflecting the strength of our integration strategy and execution. We're taking definite actions that will improve the financial performance of our North American Beverage business. And through portfolio optimization, we are focusing the business on attractive nutrition and health markets, each and all of these contribute to creating a stronger business and long-term shareholder value.\nOperator, we're ready for questions."

My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Half Year Results 2025. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, Kate, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's fiscal '25 second quarter earnings call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on this call.\nPlease be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions.\nThe second and third slides in today's presentation list several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, over to you, P.K.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Tracey, and thank you to all who have joined us for today's call. Amcor had a very active second quarter, and we're progressing well on 3 clear priorities: one, deliver on the base business; two, complete the work required to close the announced merger with Berry Global; and three, make sure we are well prepared for a fast start and integration.\nWith the base business, we start as always with safety on Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of the commitment our teams demonstrate to safety every day. The safety and well-being of our people will always be our top priority, and we're constantly looking for opportunities to improve.\nIn fiscal '25 to date, we have continued to deliver outstanding results. We achieved an industry-leading total recordable incident rate of 0.30, and 79% of our sites remained injury-free for more than a year.\nOur key messages for today are on Slide 5. Q2 results were in line with expectations we set in October as we continue to execute and deliver across key financial metrics. We are pleased to report our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential volume improvement and a return to sales growth, albeit marginal.\nMargins also continue to improve, helping drive a 5% increase in both adjusted EBIT and EPS on a comparable basis. This solid performance, along with our confidence in the second half, leaves us on track to deliver against our full year guidance, which we are reaffirming again today.\nAnd finally, as we continue to execute well on the underlying business, we're also highly focused on the unique opportunity we have to accelerate growth and enhance margin -- enhance earnings and cash generation through the previously announced combination with Berry.\nTurning to Slide 6. On our Q1 earnings call in October, I outlined my strategy for Amcor to deliver consistent, sustainable organic growth in the low to mid-single-digit range through an unwavering focus on our customers, on sustainability and on our product -- on our portfolio mix. I also shared my future vision for Amcor to become the global packaging partner of choice. The merger with Berry is directly aligned with this strategy and moves us further towards our vision.\nSlide 7 highlights the compelling rationale behind this combination. One of the most powerful and transformational long-term benefits of this merger is the opportunity to drive stronger, more consistent and sustainable volume-driven organic growth and to further improve margins. There are a number of growth unlocks that will become available with 2 of the most significant shown on this slide.\nFirst, the combined company will be a better business with a broader primary packaging portfolio at scale across consumer goods and health care end markets. In the context of a stronger, larger scale company, Amcor will be uniquely positioned to further refine and prune our portfolio mix to focus even more on attractive higher-value, faster-growing end markets.\nThis journey is already underway with Berry's recent divestitures of its HHNF and tapes businesses, which have significantly enhanced their product mix while reducing cyclicality. As a result of further pruning, we will increase average growth rates, margins and cash generation across the remaining portfolio.\nSecond, this combination creates exceptional capability and material science and innovation. We will drive growth for innovation and more sustainable packaging solutions by effectively and efficiently leveraging our combined resources.\nBringing together more than 1,500 R&D professionals, an annual R&D investment of $180 million will allow us to optimize and redirect R&D spend, providing capacity to focus on solving the most complex functionality and sustainability challenges faced by our customers and consumers. Accelerated growth, combined with significant synergies, means this combination will drive compelling near- and long-term value for all shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 8. You've seen this slide before, but let me recap a few of the drivers behind the significant and sustainable financial value we're creating. We continue to pressure test our assumptions and are confident in the $650 million in total cost growth and financial synergies we've identified and will deliver.\nWe expect to realize 40% or $260 million of total synergies in the first year and the full run rate in year 3 with an additional $280 million of onetime cash benefits from working capital improvements, which will fund cash costs to achieve synergies. Including synergies, this combination is expected to deliver significant cash EPS accretion of over 35% and annual cash flow in excess of $3 billion.\nThis will allow us to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet and deploy additional cash to invest in organic growth and M&A. We expect to increase long-term EPS growth and take the outcomes under our value -- shareholder value creation model to a new and higher level.\nTurning to Slide 9 and an update on the steps we have taken towards closing. We are moving very quickly from a process perspective to complete the work required to bring the merger to close. On January 23, we filed the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus with the SEC, and shareholder meetings are scheduled to take place on February 25.\nInitial materials required to secure regulatory approvals across nearly all required jurisdictions have been submitted, and the first approvals have been received. The composition of the Board of Directors has been finalized, and our path to completion is well advanced.\nFrom an integration preparedness perspective, we're also well positioned. We are focused on building our teams, filling key roles and ensuring we will make a fast start upon close with clearly defined plans for the first 100 days, in line with our proven integration playbook. We have a strong track record of successfully executing on large transactions, and our teams have significant experience in integrating sizable businesses.\nMoving to Slide 10 for a summary of our financial results. As noted earlier, delivering on the base business is a top priority, and we continue to execute well, with second quarter results in line with the expectations we outlined in October. Our differentiated value proposition resonates with customers, supporting a return to overall sales growth in Q2 as net sales of $3.2 billion were slightly ahead of last year. Overall volumes grew by 2.3%, improving on the first quarter and offsetting an unfavorable impact of price/mix. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in volumes.\nAs expected, destocking continued in health care, and demand remained soft in the North American beverage business, impacting mix and unfavorably impacting overall volumes by more than 1%. Across the balance of the business, overall volume growth was consistent with the first quarter, up approximately 4%.\nImproving volume trends and continued proactive cost and productivity actions more than offset unfavorable price/mix headwinds, leading to another quarter of solid earnings growth.\nAdjusted EBIT increased by 5% compared with last year, and adjusted EBIT margin expanded by over -- year-over-year by 40 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.161 also grew by 5% on a comparable basis. And cash generation was above the prior year, positioning us to reaffirm our fiscal year guidance.\nI'll now turn the call over to Michael to cover the results and outlook in more detail.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, P.K., and hello, everyone.\nBeginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 11 and focusing on our fiscal Q2 performance. Q2 volumes were up 3% compared with last year, reflecting ongoing solid growth across all key geographies and a number of important end markets.\nNet sales also returned to growth, increasing by 1% on a comparable constant currency basis. And higher volumes more than offset unfavorable price/mix of approximately 2%, primarily related to lower health care volumes.\nAs expected and discussed in prior earnings calls, we continue to see destocking in the health care in North America and Europe pharmaceuticals, which resulted in a headwind of approximately 1% to overall segment volumes. Compared to the fiscal first quarter, destocking abated, and the related price/mix headwind improved. And exiting the second quarter, we believe health care destocking is now largely behind us.\nAcross the balance of our Flexibles portfolio, volumes were up 4%, reflecting solid demand across regions and in many product categories. In North America and Europe, second quarter demand remained solid, with volumes increasing mid-single digits in both regions, despite the negative impact of health care destocking.\nTop line growth was strong across the Asian region, reflecting price/mix benefits and mid-single-digit volume growth, supported by strong demand in China and across Southeast Asia.\nIn Latin America, volumes were broadly in line with last year's second quarter with good growth in Colombia and Peru, offset by demand in Argentina.\nFrom a product category standpoint, ready meals and premium coffee showed strong growth. And dairy, meat, liquids and pet care were up low to mid-single digits. In health care, medical returned to growth. However, pharma volumes continue to be down low double digits compared with last year as a result of destocking. And as I mentioned earlier, it is now largely behind us.\nGood earnings leverage continued, and adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $322 million grew by 4% on a comparable constant currency basis. Higher volumes combined with strong cost performance and the benefits from restructuring led to another quarter of margin expansion, with adjusted EBIT margins up 20 basis points to 12.8%.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 12. The Rigid business continues to advance its performance, and the trajectory of overall segment volumes improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. Net sales were approximately 1% lower than last year, reflecting an unfavorable impact from price/mix of approximately 2%, partly offset by a return to volume growth with overall volumes up approximately 1%.\nAs expected, customer and consumer demand in the North American beverage business remains soft and variable through the quarter. While beverage volumes were down mid-single digits, this marks an improvement on the first quarter of approximately 4 percentage points.\nLatin America volumes were down single digits versus last year, reflecting weaker customer demand in Argentina and Colombia, which was partly offset by growth in other countries, including Brazil.\nThe specialty containers business delivered strong growth in spirits, wine and beer, with volumes down in health care due to destocking. And volumes in our -- in the closures business were higher than last year.\nFrom an earnings perspective, the business executed well in another quarter of growth and margin expansion reflecting benefits from an ongoing focus on cost and productivity measures. Adjusted EBIT of $53 million was up 10% on a comparable constant currency basis with EBIT margin increasing by 70 basis points to 7.3%.\nFinally, in late December, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in Bericap North America closures business, which we announced back in October. Proceeds of $122 million were used to reduce debt, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, which takes us to the cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 13.\nOn a year-to-date basis, the business generated a net cash outflow of $38 million, which includes an inflow of more than $350 million in cash flow in the second quarter, approximately $80 million better than last year's second quarter, largely on the back of improvements in working capital.\nStronger quarterly cash flow and receipt of proceeds from the Bericap sale led to a reduction in net debt of approximately $375 million compared with last quarter.\nLeverage also improved sequentially, coming in at 3.3x, which is in line with the expectations we provided on our October call. We expect leverage to further reduce through the second half of the fiscal year, and we remain confident in meeting our expectation to exit fiscal 2025 with leverage at 3x or lower.\nThrough the first 6 months of fiscal 2025, we returned approximately $365 million in cash to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.\nThis brings me to the outlook on Slide 14. And as P.K. mentioned earlier, based on our solid first half performance and our confidence in the second half, we remain on track to deliver for the full year, and we are again reaffirming our guidance.\nFor fiscal '25, we continue to expect adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share on a reported basis, representing comparable constant currency growth of 3% to 8%. We continue to expect to deliver strong growth in the underlying business for the year as earnings momentum continues to build.\nAnd as we've pointed out previously, it's important to remember that the guidance assumes an EPS headwind of up to 4% related to more normalized levels of incentive compensation based on our expectations for improved annual financial results. Excluding this incentive normalization, we expect growth from the underlying business in the mid-single to low double-digit range.\nWe continue to assume overall volumes will increase in the low to mid-single-digit range for the year, with trading performance through January in line with this expectation.\nWe have updated our interest guidance to between $290 million and $300 million, bringing the midpoint modestly lower to reflect the benefit in the second half related to the Bericap proceeds being used to reduce debt.\nAnd as a reminder, the overall impact of the Bericap sale on EPS for the year is relatively neutral, taking into account the loss of annualized EBIT of approximately $19 million and the benefit of lower interest.\nOur effective tax rate range remains unchanged at 19% to 20%. In terms of phasing through fiscal '25, we expect this will be aligned with historical average, with the second half generating 55% to 58% of EPS based on our guidance range and the fourth quarter being the strongest of the year and typically 30% or more of full year EPS.\nAnd finally, we're affirming our expectations to generate strong adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion for the year, supporting our confidence in exiting the year with leverage back at 3x or lower, as I noted earlier.\nWe are pleased with our continued execution across the underlying business, and we are confident in our outlook for the year. And we're excited about the additional opportunities we have to accelerate future growth through our combination with Berry.\nSo with that, I'll hand back to P.K.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, Michael. A few closing remarks to summarize ahead of taking questions.\nWe're executing well on the underlying business and are confident our merger with Berry is a winning combination for all stakeholders. The path to completion is clear with meaningful milestones already behind us. We remain highly focused on next steps to ensure we are setting the organization up for success, and we remain on track and confident the transaction will close around the middle of calendar year 2025.\nKate, we're ready to take questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on this call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to differ from current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, over to you, P.K.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Tracey, and thank you to all who have joined us for today's call. I want to open the call with a big thank you to our Amcor colleagues around the world, all of whom demonstrated tremendous focus in fiscal '24. Their hard work and dedication enabled us to improve our financial performance through the year and to finish the year strong, and I want to publicly recognize their efforts. In terms of Q4, we start as always with safety on Slide 3.\nSafety is our #1 priority, and our efforts to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our teams resulted in another year of improved performance, which reinforces our industry leadership when it comes to safety. 73% of our sites have remained injury-free for 12 months or longer. And overall, Amcor experienced a 12% reduction in injuries compared to fiscal '23. Our commitment to our people, and to their safety remains our most important value, and we continue to aspire to achieve our ultimate goal of 0 injuries. Turning to Slide 4.\nAmcor's near-term priorities remain consistent with those I shared on our Q3 earnings call, and I'm happy to report we're successfully delivering against these priorities. As I just mentioned, providing a safe and healthy work environment for our global workforce will always be #1.\nSecond is to stay close to our key stakeholders, including employees and customers, which helped us finish the fiscal '24 year strongly. Our teams continue to execute well in the fourth quarter, maintaining cost discipline as volume trends continue to improve sequentially with a return to volume growth in Q4. As a result, we delivered another quarter of solid margin expansion and earnings per share growth above the expectations we set out in April.\nThird is to build on the progress we have worked hard to deliver across the business and ensure we maintain momentum in fiscal '25. We expect our earnings and volume performance to continue to improve, and this is reflected in our fiscal '25 guidance. And fourth, I and our senior leaders continue to focus on providing stability for the business and helping our teams deliver for all our stakeholders. We're executing well and winning with our customers as we continue to reinforce that Amcor's strategy, agenda and priorities have not changed. Moving to our key messages for today on Slide 5.\nFirst, Amcor reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter, driven by solid performance in the underlying business and a return to volume growth, resulting in both segments delivering adjusted EBIT growth on a comparable basis.\nSecond, volumes, EPS growth and free cash flow were ahead of expectations we set out in April. Overall volumes increased 1% in the quarter compared to last year, which exceeded the low single-digit decline we were anticipating. Earnings per share also outperformed expectations, up 9%, which was above our guidance for mid-single-digit growth.\nThird, we expect to build further momentum and deliver annual EPS growth through continued strong performance from the underlying business. At the midpoint of our fiscal '25 EPS guidance range of growth of 3% to 8%, we expect total annual value generated to once again be consistent with the 10% to 15% outlined on our shareholder value creation model, assuming a dividend yield aligned with historical average.\nIt is important to point out that we expect the underlying business to continue to deliver strong growth in line with the high single-digit earnings growth experienced in Q4, considering our guidance includes an EPS headwind of approximately 4 percentage points related to normalization of incentives. Michael will step through the components embedded in our guidance range in more detail shortly.\nOur final key message is that our capital allocation priorities and strategies for long-term growth have not changed. We continue to invest in organic growth across the business, including in higher-value priority categories in emerging markets. Strategic M&A also remains an important source of incremental growth and value creation. We believe the strength of our market positions, our opportunities to invest for growth, our execution capabilities and our commitment to a compelling and growing dividend and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating sums up a convincing investment case for Amcor. Moving to Slide 6 for a summary of our financial results.\nWe finished fiscal '24 on a strong note as customer demand continued to improve off second quarter lows, and our teams did an excellent job leveraging our differentiated value proposition to support our customers and drive volumes higher. At the same time, our unwavering focus on proactive cost management through the year resulted in 4 consecutive quarters of strong margin expansion. Overall volumes returned to growth earlier than we anticipated and were up 1% in Q4, our second consecutive quarter of strong sequential volume improvement.\nAs expected, volumes across health care categories and in the North American beverage business remained soft through the fourth quarter. Combined, these 2 businesses, which represent approximately 25% of sales in Q4, unfavorably impacted overall volumes by approximately 2%. Across the balance of the business, overall volumes were approximately 3% higher than the June quarter last year. This reflects broad-based improvements in customer demand across many end markets and what we believe is the end of destocking in all categories other than health care. Price/mix had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately 3%, primarily driven by continued destocking in high-margin health care categories.\nCost reduction and productivity initiatives remained a focus, and we delivered another quarter of significant cost savings totaling more than $110 million, including an additional $20 million of benefits from structural cost initiatives in Q4. This builds on the outstanding efforts by all our teams across the businesses through the first 3 quarters, bringing the total cost savings for the year to more than $40 million, including structural savings of $35 million. The result of improving volume trends and our focus on cost and productivity actions was another quarter of strong earnings delivered as momentum in Amcor's underlying business continue. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.211 grew by 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, above our April guidance for mid-single-digit growth and adjusted EBIT was up 4% compared with last year.\nOverall, for fiscal '24, we delivered adjusted EPS toward the top end of our guidance range we provided last August and our ongoing focus on cash conversion was rewarded with adjusted free cash flow of $952 million, up more than $100 million on last year and just above the top end of our guidance range. We also continued to return significant cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend, in addition to share repurchase, which combined totaled approximately $750 million for fiscal '24.\nI'll turn it over to Michael now to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook. Michael?\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, P.K., and hello, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7 and focusing on our fiscal Q4 performance.\nQ4 volumes increased by 3%, which represented a significant sequential improvement of 5 percentage points compared with the March quarter. Net sales, however, were down 1% on a comparable constant currency basis as volume growth was offset by unfavorable price/mix of approximately 4%, primarily related to lower health care sales, which we anticipated. Destocking in health care categories continued in North America and Europe, and this resulted in a headwind of approximately 2% on overall segment volumes.\nAcross the balance of our Flexibles portfolio, Amcor experienced very solid growth, with volumes increasing by approximately 5% in the quarter. The improved customer demand we saw in the third quarter continued as customers increased their focus on growing volumes and return to more normalized order patterns now that destocking has ended. This led to broad-based growth across most geographies, with volumes increasing in several categories, including meat, cheese, home and personal care and unconverted film and foil.\nAcross North America and Europe, fourth quarter demand improved across many end markets, resulting in a return to overall volume growth in the low to mid-single-digit range in both regions despite continued softness in health care. In North America, volumes were higher in meat, cheese and snacks categories. And in Europe, the business delivered particularly strong volume growth in meat, home and personal care and unconverted film and foil.\nEmerging market volumes were up mid-single digits in Q4. Most countries experienced solid growth, with volumes in China increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter and strength continuing in India, Thailand, Brazil and Mexico, to name a few.\nAdjusted EBIT for the quarter of $403 million was 5% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Higher volumes, combined with strong cost performance through the quarter, including from restructuring initiatives, led to another quarter of margin expansion, with EBIT margins up 110 basis points to 15%. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8.\nVolumes and earnings trajectory for Rigids continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with the business delivering consecutive quarters of earnings growth in the second half. As anticipated, overall volume performance for the business improved sequentially as the 5% volume decline in Q4 was 3 percentage points better than the March quarter. As expected, the Q4 decline was driven by lower volumes in the North American beverage business. Across the balance of the Rigid Packaging portfolio, volumes were in line with the fourth quarter last year and favorable price/mix benefits of approximately 3%, resulted in a 2% decline in net sales on a comparable constant currency basis.\nIn North America, beverage volumes were down 8%, reflecting lower consumer demand in Amcor's key end markets and unfavorable customer mix. Volumes improved by 3 percentage points on a sequential basis as destocking ended and warmer weather resulted in modest improvement in consumer consumption versus the March quarter. In Latin America, volumes increased in the low single-digit range compared with last year, driven by continued growth in Brazil and Colombia.\nFrom an earnings perspective, the business delivered another quarter of earnings growth and margin expansion through an ongoing focus on cost reduction and productivity measures and the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives. Adjusted EBIT increased by 2% in Q4, with EBIT margin increasing by 70 basis points to 8.8%. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9.\nAdjusted free cash flow for fiscal '24 was just above the top end of our guidance range at $952 million, up more than $100 million or 12% compared with last year. Cash generation was strong through the fourth quarter, and we delivered good cash conversion by remaining laser-focused on improving working capital performance, with inventories reducing for the sixth consecutive quarter. The timing of spend on CapEx projects was also a modest tailwind in the year, which we expect to unwind in fiscal '25. Leverage at 3.1x was down 0.3 of a turn from the March quarter and was in line with our expectations for year-end. This brings me to the outlook on Slide 10.\nFor fiscal '25, we expect to continue building on the volume and earnings momentum we achieved through the second half of fiscal '24. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share on a reported basis, representing comparable constant currency growth of 3% to 8%.\nAs P.K. noted earlier, we expect the growth in the underlying business will remain strong in fiscal '25. However, it's important to note that our guidance includes an EPS headwind of approximately 4% related to more normalized levels of incentive compensation based on our expectations for improved annual financial results. Excluding this incentive normalization, our guidance range implies expected growth from the underlying business in the high single to low double-digit range.\nOur guidance range assumes an expected volume increase in the low to mid-single-digit range for the year, with trading performance in July aligned with this expectation. Interest expense is expected to be between $290 million and $305 million, and the effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 19% to 20%. When combining interest and tax in absolute terms, the expectation is for a modest headwind to earnings when compared with fiscal '24.\nIn terms of phasing, we anticipate this will be broadly aligned with historical average of approximately 45% of earnings being delivered in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with the fourth quarter typically the strongest of the year.\nAnd finally, we expect to continue to generate strong adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, even as we fund an increase in capital expenditure of approximately $40 million to $60 million from a lower base in '24, which I mentioned earlier. And we expect to exit the year with leverage back within our 2.5 to 3x management range. We are pleased with the finish to fiscal '24 and look forward to delivering strong financial results in '25 and beyond.\nSo with that, I'll hand it back to you, P.K.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Michael. In closing, on Slide 11, we finished '24 on a strong note, and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in volumes we're seeing across most geographies and end markets. Earnings both -- earnings growth in both segments in the second half of fiscal '24, combined with a return to volume growth in the fourth quarter and the trends experienced in the first several weeks of fiscal '25, give us confidence that momentum will continue to build on the underlying business.\nWe expect overall volumes to continue to grow in fiscal '25 and we will maintain a sharp focus on cost control and productivity initiatives to drive solid earnings growth. And importantly, assuming a dividend yield aligned with historical average at the midpoint of our EPS guidance range, we are well positioned to deliver annual value generated in fiscal '25 to be in line with the 10% to 15% outlined in our shareholder value creation model.\nWe'll continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow the business by staying close to our customers, providing the support and the differentiated more sustainable packaging solutions they need to protect, preserve and promote their products as they drive their own volume growth. We continue to invest in organic growth, including in higher-value priority categories and emerging markets.\nStrategic M&A is an important source for incremental growth and value creation, and we're committed to a compelling dividend, which grows annually. We're confident in our execution capabilities and in the opportunities we have to continue delivering profitable growth from the underlying business and to create strong free cash flow in fiscal '25 and beyond.\nOperator, we're now ready to turn the line over to questions."

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Third Quarter 2024 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, a few items to note. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call.

[Operator Instructions] With that, over to you, P.K.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Tracey, and thank you to all who have joined us for today's call. Prior to discussing our third quarter performance, I want to spend a few moments recognizing my predecessor, Ron Delia, and his many accomplishments at Amcor.\nIn the last few years alone, Ron led us through the transformational acquisition and integration of Bemis, the largest acquisition in the company's history, successfully and safely guided the business through a pandemic and made the difficult and correct decision to divest our business in Russia. And most recently, Ron directed our teams in navigating a particularly challenging economic period.\nAnd now I speak for the Board, our global management team and our employees around the world, in thanking Ron for his leadership, guidance and dedication during his 18 years with Amcor and 9 years as CEO. I've worked closely with Ron, our Board and the other members of our executive team over many years to help shape and execute our strategy, and I'm honored to take the leadership reins in an interim capacity at this time.\nToday, Amcor is the established industry leader in our key markets and geographies, has world-class talent and clearly differentiated commercial innovation capabilities, all providing us with multiple opportunities to capture high-value growth. Importantly, the business is also well positioned to continue benefiting from the proactive steps taken by our leaders across the company to align the cost base with recent challenging market conditions.\nThe results of those decisive actions were again evident in our third quarter financial performance as we showed strong earnings leverage across the business. Third quarter year-over-year volume performance also improved on a sequential basis, and we expect this trend to continue driving stronger earnings growth as we close fiscal year '24.\nMy role right now is to ensure we stay focused and on track and that we capitalize on the strong position we're in to maintain momentum and further accelerate earnings growth. It is a team effort and will drive success, and I'm surrounded and supported by credible leaders and talented team players throughout our organization.\nAs seen on Slide 3, my near-term priorities are simple. First, ensure Amcor continues to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our global workforce. Second, stay close to our key stakeholders, including our employees and customers, and finish our 2024 fiscal year strongly. After an improved third quarter performance, we are well positioned to do so, and we've raised our full year guidance today.\nThird, build on the momentum we have worked hard to deliver across the business, and as we work through our planning cycle for fiscal '25, set clear priorities to ensure our momentum continues. And fourth, provide stability for the business and keep our teams focused on delivering for all our stakeholders by reinforcing that. Our strategy has not changed, our agenda has not changed and our priorities have not changed.\nMoving to Amcor's Q3 performance, starting with safety on Slide 4. Our commitment to health and safety of our teams remains our #1 priority, and we continue to focus on providing a safe and healthy work environment. 72% of our sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months or longer, and we've experienced a 19% reduction in injuries compared to the first 9 months of fiscal '23. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture and is a critical cornerstone of our success.\nTurning to our key messages for today on Slide 5. First, outperformance in the underlying business resulted in adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter that exceeded the expectations we set out in February. Our Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segment each delivered adjusted EBIT growth, leading to Amcor returning to year-over-year earnings growth a quarter sooner than we anticipated. Improved working capital performance through the year also resulted in a year-to-date increase in adjusted free cash flow.\nSecond, as I mentioned earlier, our third quarter volume trajectory improved significantly on a sequential basis as destocking abated across most end markets, and we experienced higher customer demand in several of our businesses. While this is clearly an encouraging and positive trend, our teams remain highly focused on continuing to control costs, and this helped us deliver a third consecutive quarter of improved earnings leverage and a return to earnings growth.\nThird, our March quarter financial performance and expected further momentum in our fourth quarter gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $0.685 to $0.71 per share and reaffirm our guidance for adjusted free cash flow between $850 million and $950 million for the fiscal year. We believe we have turned the corner after a challenging calendar 2023, and we expect our sequential volume and earnings growth trajectories will continue to improve, which is supported by the demand trends experienced across the business in the first weeks of April.\nFinally, we remain confident in our capital allocation framework and strategy for long-term growth. We believe the strength of our market positions, our opportunities for investment and our execution capabilities, along with our commitment to a compelling and growing dividend, make a convincing investment case for Amcor.\nMoving to Slide 6 for a summary of our financial results. The first 9 months of fiscal '24 continued to reflect significant benefits from our proactive cost actions. Three consecutive quarters of strong operating leverage helped offset the unfavorable impact of 7% lower year-to-date sales, leading to a decline in adjusted EBIT of 3%. We believe we've reached an inflection point in the trajectory of earnings and volumes with our Q3 results, and we are pleased with our financial results in the March quarter.\nBetter-than-anticipated demand trends and continued strong cost performance resulted in EBIT and earnings per share ahead of our expectations entering the quarter. The underlying business saw a return to profit growth in the third quarter with adjusted EBIT up 3% compared with last year. Volume trends improved as the broad-based destocking experienced in the December quarter abated and customer demand strengthened.\nOur teams also continue to focus on cost reduction and productivity initiatives and delivered another quarter of outstanding results with approximately $130 million in total cost savings, including approximately $15 million of benefits from structural cost initiatives. These benefits, combined with improving volume trends, resulted in another quarter of improved earnings leverage. Interest and tax expects were modestly higher than the prior year, in line with our expectations, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.178, grew by 1%.\nQ3 net sales were down 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which primarily reflects overall volumes 4% lower than the prior year. This is predominantly related to expected ongoing weakness, including further destocking in health care categories and in the North American beverage business, which collectively represent approximately 30% of Amcor's total sales.\nAcross the remaining 70% of our business, overall net volumes were relatively flat with last year, a significant improvement compared with the December quarter, and the business delivered volume growth across several categories and geographies. Outside of health care, we believe destocking is now largely behind us.\nPrice/mix for Q3 had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately 3%, which is a result of greater volume declines in high-margin health care categories, which we anticipated and called out last quarter. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend and share repurchases, and which totaled approximately $570 million through the first 9 months of the year.\nI'll turn it over to Michael now to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, PK, and hello, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7 and focusing on our Q3 performance. Net sales for Q3 were down 6%, reflecting an unfavorable price/mix impact of 4% and a 2% decline in overall volumes, which was a significant improvement of 8 percentage points compared with the December quarter. As we anticipated and called out last quarter, volumes for health care products remained weak and destocking continued, particularly in North America and Europe.\nIn total, health care volumes were down double digits, and this had an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on overall segment volumes and was the primary driver of the 4% unfavorable mix in the quarter. Across the balance of our Flexibles portfolio, net volumes grew approximately 1% in the quarter, with growth in several end markets, including meat, pet food, cheese and unconverted film and foil, and we also saw growth across a number of emerging markets.\nAcross North America and Europe, third quarter net sales declined at high single-digit rates, unfavorably impacted by a mid-single-digit lower volumes and unfavorable price/mix related to declines in health care categories. Excluding health care, across these 2 regions, we saw mid-single-digit volume growth in cheese, and a strong, sequential improvement in meat and pet care volumes, which were flat and up low single digits for the quarter, respectively.\nAcross the Asian region, net sales were modestly higher than the prior year. China grew volumes for the third consecutive quarter, and volume growth in Thailand, India and the Philippines also helped offset lower volumes in Southeast Asian health care business. In Latin America, the business delivered good volume growth in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Q3 adjusted EBIT of $358 million was 5% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Strong cost performance through the quarter, including from restructuring initiatives, combined with broadly improving demand trends, led to another quarter of strong earnings leverage, and EBIT margins increased by 170 basis points to 13.8%.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. Q3 net sales were 8% lower on a comparable constant currency basis, mainly reflecting lower volumes. While overall volumes were down 8% for the quarter, this represents a meaningful improvement over the December quarter. In North America, overall beverage volumes continue to be impacted by soft consumer and customer demand in Amcor's key end markets, along with some lingering destocking. Total beverage volumes were down 11%, improving sequentially from the 19% decline we experienced in December quarter, which was impacted by significantly more destocking.\nLatin American volumes were in line with last year with growth in Brazil and Colombia offset by weaker demand in Argentina. We are pleased to see the Rigid Packaging business return to earnings growth, with adjusted third quarter EBIT up modestly over last year. Strong earnings leverage resulting from a continued focus on cost reduction and productivity measures and the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives more than offset lower volumes, leading to an 80 basis point increase in EBIT margins to 8.7% for the quarter.\nMoving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9. Adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was approximately $100 million ahead of last year, mainly driven by improved working capital performance and successfully reducing inventory levels for the fifth consecutive quarter. Leverage at 3.4x is broadly in line with the first half and within the range of expected outcomes for the third quarter.\nAs a reminder, the business is cycling through temporary increases in working capital, and trailing 12-month EBITDA remains at lower than historic levels, reflecting the divestiture of our Russian business in December 2022. Looking ahead, we continue to expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3x at the end of our fiscal year, supported by seasonally stronger earnings and cash flow in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nThis brings me to our outlook on Slide 10. As PK noted earlier, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to $0.685 to $0.71 per share to reflect our performance in the underlying business in the third quarter and our expectation that volumes will continue to improve through the balance of the year. We also remain focused on controlling costs and expect to deliver further savings in Q4, including from our structural initiatives.\nFor fiscal 2024, we continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus or minus low single-digit range, with share repurchases adding a benefit of approximately 2% and favorable currency translation contributing a benefit of up to 2%. This is offset by negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our Russian business in December 2022, the impact which was all in the first half. We also expect a negative impact of up to 6% from higher interest and tax expense, which takes into account our updated estimate for the full year net interest expense of between $310 million to $320 million.\nWe are confident we will build on our third quarter performance, and adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to grow over last year by mid-single digits on a comparable constant currency basis. And overall volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to be down in the low single-digit range, primarily due to ongoing destocking in health care categories and continued weak consumer and customer demand in North American beverage.\nWe expect the volume improvement we experienced in the third quarter to continue as we progress through the fourth quarter, which will position us well as we enter fiscal 2025. We have also reaffirmed our guidance range for adjusted free cash flow of $850 million to $950 million for the year. So with that, I'll hand back to PK.\n\nPeter Konieczny\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Michael. In closing, on Slide 11, our Q3 financial results, guidance for the balance of the fiscal year and our expectation that we will continue to build earnings momentum in fiscal '25 all highlight that Amcor is a very well-positioned business.\nAmcor's industry leadership across the globe is well established. Our differentiated innovation capabilities are assisting the world's best-known brands and smaller companies in achieving their objectives to protect, preserve and promote their products while enabling them to meet the sustainability commitments they have made to the stakeholders, and Amcor's talented employees around the world are capitalizing on growth opportunities in priority categories, emerging markets and through sustainable offerings while also continuing to closely focus on cost controls.\nWe're confident we will continue to see positive momentum given the actions we have taken and continue to take across our operations to invest in growth, reduce cost and improve productivity. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, my role right now is to ensure we stay focused and on track and that we capitalize on the strong position we are in to maintain momentum and further accelerate earnings growth.\nThe continued safety of our people will always be at the top of Amcor's agenda, but a very close second for me right now is to keep our teams focused on delivering for all our stakeholders by reinforcing that our strategy, our agenda and our priorities have not changed. Our Q3 volume trajectory and financial performance underscores our confidence in stronger earnings growth momentum as the challenges we faced in calendar '23 are put further behind us. We have raised our full year EPS guidance, and we anticipate delivering mid-single-digit earnings growth in Q4.\nOur performance in the first few weeks of April supports this expectation, and our commitments to our longer-term growth and value creation strategy gives us line of sight to a return to growth in line with our shareholder value creation model.\nOperator, we're now ready to turn the line over to questions."

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor's First Half and Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Tracey, you may begin your conference.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal 2024 First Half and Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items.\nOn our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. And reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's second quarter and first half results for fiscal '24. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAs seen on Slide 3, our focus on safety remains unwavering, and our significant commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment continues to be rewarded. 70% of our sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months or longer, and we've experienced a 17% reduction in injuries when compared to the first half of fiscal 2023. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture and is the #1 priority for our global teams.\nTurning to our key messages on Slide 4. First, our reported earnings per share for the second quarter and first half were modestly better than the expectations we set out in October. And improved working capital performance helped drive a year-over-year increase of more than $100 million in adjusted free cash flow.\nSecond, our financial performance through the half was supported by strong and proactive focus on controlling costs. This helped us offset second quarter volumes that we're a couple of percentage points lower than we anticipated. Our teams around the world continue to respond doing an excellent job proactively taking further cost actions.\nThird, our first half financial performance puts us on track to deliver against our full year guidance, which we are again reaffirming today. Relative to the first half, we believe Q2 was the low point for earnings growth and we continue to expect the trajectory of adjusted EPS growth to improve through the second half of fiscal '24, including delivering mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nOur confidence is supported by our improved earnings leverage as well as a number of known factors, we'll cover in more detail later that will benefit earnings through the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, our volume trajectory has improved generally through January and this underpins our confidence that Q2 marked the low point for volumes.\nFinally, we remain confident in our long-term growth and value creation strategy and in our ability to deliver a combination of strong earnings growth and a compelling and growing dividend. The strength of our market positions, execution capabilities and consistent capital allocation framework collectively continue to make a compelling investment case for Amcor.\nMoving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Organic sales on a comparable constant currency basis were down 8% for the half and 10% for the quarter. Price/mix benefits were around 1% for the first half and flat in the second quarter, reflecting moderating inflation, which resulted in reduced pricing actions by our teams. Volumes were down 9% for the first half and down 10% for the December quarter. Second quarter volumes were modestly lower than our October expectations, with the main difference being an acceleration of destocking, especially in the month of December.\nFirst half and December quarter adjusted EBIT was $709 million and $352 million, respectively, modestly above our expectations. On a comparable constant currency basis, declines of approximately 6% in both periods reflect lower volumes, partly offset by benefits related to decisive and proactive cost actions taken across our businesses in response to evolving market dynamics.\nIn total, our actions reduced costs by more than $200 million in the first half compared to last year, with a reduction of more than $130 million achieved in the second quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.313 and $0.157 per share, respectively, also modestly above our earlier expectations. For both periods, this would count 10% on a comparable basis, reflecting lower adjusted EBIT and the unfavorable impact of higher interest costs.\nWorking capital improvement remains a focus and helped drive free cash flow for the first half, well ahead of the same period last year and in line with our expectations. And we returned approximately $390 million of cash to shareholders in the first half through a combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend, which has increased to $0.125 per share.\nI'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, Ron, and hello, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6. Year-to-date, net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 8% lower, which largely reflects weaker volumes. Volumes were down 9%, mainly due to lower market and customer demand and accelerated destocking.\nIn North America, first half net sales declined at high single-digit rates driven by lower volumes in categories, including meat, liquid beverage and health care, which more than offset growth in the condiments, snacks and confectionery categories.\nIn Europe, net sales declined at low double-digit rates driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits. Volumes were lower in snacks, coffee, health care and in unconverted film and foil. This was partly offset by higher confectionary volumes.\nAcross the Asian region, net sales were modestly higher than the prior year. Volume growth in Thailand, India and China helped offset lower volumes in the Southeast Asian health care business. In Latin America, net sales declined at high single-digit rates driven by lower volumes mainly in Chile and Mexico, partly offset by growth in Brazil.\nFirst half adjusted EBIT was 5% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis as a result of lower volumes, partly offset by favorable price/mix benefits and ongoing actions taken to lower costs increased productivity and strengthen operating cost performance. EBIT margin of 12.6% was comparable to prior year despite a 50-basis-point unfavorable comparison related to the sale of our Russian business last year.\nFor the December quarter, reported sales were down 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, and price/mix was relatively neutral compared with last year. Volumes were down 10% in the quarter, reflecting continued soft market and customer demand. Destocking also continued through the quarter accelerating in the month of December and was particularly impactful in health care where volumes were lower than last year by double digits.\nIn response to market dynamics, the business continued to take decisive cost actions, focusing on operating efficiencies and delivering procurement benefits, limiting discretionary spend and advancing structural cost reduction initiatives. This resulted in another quarter of strong performance, partly offsetting weaker volumes with adjusted EBIT declining 5% on a comparable constant currency basis.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. Year-to-date net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 8% lower, with price/mix contributing around 1%. Volumes were down 9% for the first half, with lower volumes in North America, partly offset by growth in Latin America. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the first half were 14% lower than last year, including a 13% reduction in hot fill beverage container volumes due to lower consumer and customer demand and elevated levels of destocking through the first half.\nIn Latin America, volumes grew mid-single-digit rates with new business wins in Brazil, Peru and Colombia, partly offsetting lower volumes in Mexico. Adjusted EBIT was 9% lower than last year on a comparable basis, reflecting lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance.\nFor the December quarter, net sales were also down 10% on a comparable constant currency basis. Price/mix contributed around 2%, and volumes were down 12% for the quarter, reflecting lower volumes in North America, partly offset by new business wins, driving mid-single-digit growth in Latin America.\nOverall, North American beverage volumes were 19% lower for the quarter, reflecting a high single-digit decline from destocking as some of our customers took action to significantly reduce inventories in both hot fill and cold field categories. Volumes were also impacted in the high single-digit range by incrementally softer consumer and customer demand in Amcor's key end markets.\nIn addition, we had net new business wins in the hot fill category, which partly offset a loss in cold fill as we elected not to retain volumes that fell short of our profitability threshold. Second quarter adjusted EBIT declined by 12% and reflecting lower volumes, partly offset by benefits from continuing to proactively manage costs, including realizing labor savings by taking more plant shutdown days to better align capacity with market dynamics as well as driving procurement benefits.\nMoving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. As Ron covered earlier, adjusted free cash flow for the half came in more than $100 million ahead of last year. With our teams continuing to make progress against our priority to reduce inventories and driving capital increments across the board.\nOur financial profile remains solid with leverage at 3.4x, broadly in line with the first quarter and where we expected it to be as we cycle through temporary increases in working capital and given trailing 12-month EBITDA now fully reflects the divestiture of our Russian business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3x at the end of our fiscal year, supported by seasonally stronger earnings and cash flow in the second half.\nThis brings me to our outlook on Slide 9. As Ron mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. We continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus or minus low single-digit range, with share repurchases adding a benefit of approximately 2%, and favorable currency translation contributing a benefit of up to 2%. This is offset by a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our Russian business in December '22, the impact of which was all in the first half.\nWe also expect a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense, which takes into account our estimate for full year net interest expense of between $315 million to $330 million, which is modestly lower than where we were forecasting last quarter. Our full year tax rate expectations are unchanged in the range of 18% to 20%.\nIn relation to phasing, we believe that December quarter marks the low point in terms of Amcor's earnings growth and volume declines. January volumes have improved following heavy customer destocking in December. And while we expect market dynamics to remain volatile in the near term, our volume trajectory is expected to continue to improve through the balance of the year. We anticipate Q3 volumes will be down in the mid-single-digit range, and expect fourth quarter volume declines in the low single-digit range.\nTaking into account offsetting benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a reduced headwind from higher interest costs compared with last year, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be down mid-single digits on a comparable constant currency basis. And for the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to increase by mid-single digits over the prior year. And Ron will talk through the factors that support this return to growth shortly.\nAdjusted free cash flow continues to trend better than last year as we expected and we are again reaffirming our guidance range of $850 million to $950 million for our fiscal '24 full year, which will be up to $100 million higher compared with last year. Our plan to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in '24 is unchanged, and we continue to pursue value-creating M&A opportunities.\nWith that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Michael. Prior to opening the call to questions, I want to provide additional insights into our outlook for the balance of the year as well as a reminder, the key components comprising our longer-term model for driving shareholder value.\nLooking first at the balance of fiscal '24. As I referenced earlier and as highlighted on Slide 10, there are a number of key factors already known to us that give us confidence our earnings trajectory will improve through the second half of the fiscal year. First, the earnings headwind related to the sale of our business in Russia is now fully behind us, eliminating an unfavorable comparative that impacted reported earnings throughout calendar '23. Second, while second half interest expense is expected to be higher than last year, the magnitude of the headwind from the rapid rate increases over the past 18 months begins to abate as we move through the balance of the year.\nThird, we have benefits from structural cost savings of $35 million in the second half with an additional $15 million to benefit fiscal '25. These savings are primarily related to plant closures as we optimize our global footprint. And fourth, earnings leverage has improved due to our commitment to take proactive actions to align our cost structure with evolving market dynamics. This includes eliminating shifts to take out labor reducing over time, driving procurement and maintaining tight control of discretionary spend.\nIn total, over the last 12 months, we reduced headcount by more than 2,000 full-time employees or approximately 5% of our workforce with more than 1,000 of these reductions taken out in the first half of fiscal '24.\nFrom an earnings perspective, operating costs were lower by more than $200 million in the first half of fiscal '24 compared with the prior period. And more than $100 million of this cost reduction was delivered in the second quarter, which is almost double the approximately $70 million delivered in the first quarter. The result has been and will continue to be improved earnings leverage which we've achieved this financial year-to-date despite significantly lower volumes.\nAs Michael mentioned, we are off to a better start in January and are confident Q2 marks the low point for earnings growth and volume declines and with our overall trajectory expected to improve as we move to the balance of the year.\nTo sum up, we're confident the positive earnings impact from multiple known factors will drive improved momentum in the second half of fiscal '24, including delivering mid-single-digit earnings growth in our fiscal fourth quarter. Importantly, we're not assuming an improving consumer demand environment, and we'll continue to be proactive in taking actions to ensure our cost base and pricing strategies reflect market conditions.\nMoving to Slide 11. As we look beyond the second half of this fiscal year, these known factors will serve as important building blocks supporting a return to delivering against our shareholder value creation model, through a combination of strong earnings growth and a compelling and growing dividend, currently yielding 5%. The starting point in creating value will always be growing the business. And over the last 10 years, we've averaged 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. As you can see on this slide, we have multiple drivers of margin accretive growth, each with significant upside opportunity over the longer term. We will also continue to enhance our ability to grow in these areas through stepping up CapEx over a multiyear period, and executing on strategic M&A.\nAs volumes normalize and improve, these generally faster growing and higher value growth areas will represent a larger proportion of sales becoming increasingly stronger contributors to earnings. And when we return to a more normalized volume growth environment, this combination of improved mix and the proactive steps we've taken to optimize our cost base positions Amcor well to again deliver strong earnings growth in line with our long track record.\nTo close on Slide 12, we're executing well to deliver against the earning and cash flow expectations we set coming into fiscal '24. Our teams are being proactive as market dynamics evolved and focusing on the controllables to take additional cost out where appropriate. We have line of sight to mid-single-digit earnings growth in Q4 and our commitment to our longer-term growth and value creation strategy positions us well to deliver on our shareholder value creation model when the volume environment normalizes.\nOperator, with those opening remarks, we're now ready to turn the line over to questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal '24 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. Before handing over, a few items to note. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call.\nPlease be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions.

Reference can also be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's first quarter results for fiscal 2024. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAs seen on Slide 3, Amcor continues to be an industry leader in safety with a recordable case frequency rate that has trended significantly downwards over many years. In our first quarter, 65% of our sites around the world were injury-free for the past 12 months, with more than 30% injury free for 3 years or more. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture, and providing a safe and healthy working environment is the #1 focus for our global teams.\nTurning to our key messages on Slide 4. First, we delivered a first quarter result in line with our expectations despite a challenging demand environment characterized by continued weak consumer demand and ongoing customer destocking. Against this backdrop, our teams executed well and remained focused on managing the areas under their immediate control.\nSecond, the first quarter performance puts us on track to deliver against our full year guidance, which we are reaffirming today. Our expectations for phasing through the 2 halves of the fiscal year have not changed, and we continue to expect adjusted EPS for the second half of fiscal '24 to grow by mid-single digits over last year on a comparable constant currency basis. As a reminder, there are several reasons why we expect a stronger second half, including continued benefits and increased earnings leverage from ongoing price and cost actions, additional benefits from structural cost initiatives building through the year, a reduction in interest expense headwinds and favorable comparisons to the prior year's volume performance.\nOur third key message is we're making significant strides in our sustainability efforts within our own operations and in the design of our products. Our commitment to sustainability and the creation of a circular economy for packaging represents one of our most promising avenues for growth as we enable our customers to meet consumer demand for more responsible packaging.\nAnd fourth, we remain confident in our long-term growth and value creation strategy. The strength of our market positions and underlying business, our proven execution capabilities and our consistent capital allocation framework collectively make a compelling case for investment in Amcor.\nMoving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. September quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations as we continue to take proactive cost and price actions to align the business with market dynamics, including ongoing inflation and continued weak and volatile volumes. Sales were 6% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis, which reflects price/mix benefits of approximately 2%, offset by an 8% decline in volumes, which was within the range we anticipated for the first half of fiscal '24.\nAs expected, volume weakness persisted and was broad based through the September quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and continued customer inventory destocking. Fiscal first quarter adjusted EBIT of $358 million was 5% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Benefits from ongoing cost actions and price and mix benefits were more than offset by the weaker volumes.\nAnd our teams drove working capital improvements, which resulted in free cash flow being well ahead of the same period last year. We expect to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders this fiscal year with returns of approximately $200 million in the first quarter, up more than 10% over last year through a combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend which the Board increased to $0.125 per share.\nI'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, Ron, and hello, everyone. Turning to our Flexibles segment performance on Slide 6. Net sales were down 8% on a reported basis, which includes a favorable impact of 3% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and an unfavorable impact of 2% related to the pass-through of lower raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were down 6%, reflecting 8% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 2% as the business continues to take pricing actions to recover inflation.\nFirst quarter volume trends remained similar to last quarter, with all regions continuing to be impacted by lower consumer demand and destocking. Volumes across North America and Europe were down high single digits, with Europe a little softer than North America. Volumes in Latin America were also down high single digits. And in Asia, volumes were broadly in line with last year as continued growth in India and a return to positive volume growth in China offset lower overall volumes in Southeast Asia.\nThe impact of destocking across the Flexibles business was similar to last quarter, accounting for approximately 1/3 of total volume declines. By end market, we continue to see soft demand and destocking impact categories, including protein, coffee, liquid beverage and health care. Pet care and confectionary categories remained strong in key markets with volume growth delivered in the quarter. Adjusted EBIT was down 5% in comparable constant currency terms for the quarter, reflecting favorable operating cost performance and price/mix benefits, offset by the lower volumes.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. Reported sales were 6% lower than last year, including the favorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and the unfavorable impact of 1% related to the pass-through of lower raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 6% lower than last year as price/mix benefits of approximately 1% were offset by a 7% decline in volumes.\nIn North America, volumes in both the beverage and specialty containers business continued to be impacted by lower consumer demand and similar levels of custom destocking as experienced last quarter. In the beverage business, overall volumes were down 9%, although mix trends were favorable. In specialty containers, volume growth in food was offset by weaker volumes in health care and home and personal care.\nIn Latin America, while market demand was somewhat softer across the region, our business is benefiting from new business wins and overall volumes were up mid-single digits compared with last year. The businesses in Brazil and Colombia delivered strong volume growth, offsetting lower volumes in Mexico. Adjusted EBIT was 6% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower overall volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance.\nIn terms of cash flow and the balance sheet, on Slide 8. Our adjusted free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations and meaningfully better than last year, enabling us to reaffirm our full year cash flow guidance, which I'll come back to shortly. The cash flow improvement of more than $170 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, mainly reflects our focused inventory reduction efforts, which have resulted in a decrease of more than $500 million since the peak in November 2022. We remain highly focused on working capital performance, which is particularly critical in this environment of continued inflation and raising interest rates -- rising interest rates.\nWe also continued to return cash to shareholders, purchasing approximately 3 million shares during the first quarter for a total cost of $30 million. And consistent with our comments in August, we expect to allocate a total of at least $70 million towards share repurchases in fiscal '24. In terms of the balance sheet, we maintained a strong investment-grade credit rating with leverage of 3.3x, in line with our expectations at this time, taking into account the usual seasonality of cash flows and the short-term impacts of cycling the divestiture of our Russian business earnings and higher working capital levels. We expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3x by the end of the fourth quarter.\nTurning to our outlook on Slide 9. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations and we are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. We continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus or minus low single-digit range, and share repurchases will result in a benefit of approximately 2%. The U.S. dollar has strengthened slightly since August, and we now anticipate currency translation to result in a benefit of up to 2%. This is expected to be offset by a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our 3 plants in Russia in December 2022. And we also expect a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense.\nOur expectations for interest and tax expense for the full year remain unchanged with interest in the range of $320 million to $340 million and a tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. In terms of cash flow, we are trending better than the first quarter last year, and we continue to expect significant adjusted free cash flow in the range of $850 million to $950 million in fiscal '24, representing growth of up to $100 million over last year. Our plan to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in 2024 is unchanged, and we continue to pursue value-creating M&A opportunities.\nTurning to Slide 10. Amcor has a proven track record of strong and consistent long-term earnings growth. As noted on our call in August, it's important to call out that fiscal 2024 phasing of comparable earnings growth is not expected to align with prior years. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we anticipate challenging market dynamics will persist in the near term, resulting in similar mid- to high single-digit volume declines through the December quarter. Combined with the unfavorable impact of higher interest expense, which is expected to moderate in the second half, our guidance for the first half is unchanged.\nCompared with last year, we expect that adjusted EPS for the 6 months of fiscal 2024 will be down in the high single-digit to low double-digit range on a comparable constant currency basis. For the second quarter, this implies adjusted EPS and EBIT in absolute terms will be broadly in line with or marginally lower than the September quarter just finished.\nAs Ron mentioned earlier, our confidence in delivering mid-single-digit comparable constant currency earnings growth in the second half of fiscal '24 and resuming our long-term trend of high single-digit earnings growth shortly thereafter is supported by visibility to several known second half factors.\nFirst, we have the benefit of approximately $35 million from structural cost-saving initiatives that builds through the year; second, we have increased earnings leverage resulting from ongoing benefits of price and cost actions taken; third, as I noted earlier, a reduced interest headwind; and fourth, we expect that customer inventories will have largely normalized as we progress through the second half, and we will benefit from favorable prior year volume comparatives.\nFinally, and also consistent with our comments in August, we do not need to see a significant change in the demand environment to return to solid earnings growth in the second half and beyond. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Ron to provide some longer-term comments.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Michael. Before we open the call to questions, I want to provide a few words on the building blocks that inform how we think about growth over the longer term and then finish with a brief preview of our 2023 sustainability report which will be released in the coming days.\nLooking at Slide 11, we have multiple drivers that have enabled us to deliver solid and sustainable earnings growth over the longer term, including opportunities in priority categories, emerging markets and through innovation. These have not changed and collectively give us confidence in our ability to deliver future growth in line with our historic trend rates.\nTurning to Slide 12 and some highlights from our forthcoming sustainability report, which covers the significant strides we've made in product development and operational sustainability. Sustainability provides meaningful opportunities to differentiate and drive growth and value. This is particularly important in today's landscape as consumers focus on the critical need for more sustainable, high-performance packaging solutions and as customers increasingly look to work closely with responsible sustainability-focused partners.\nStarting with our own operations. Since launching Amcor's EnviroAction program 15 years ago, we've diligently worked towards reducing our greenhouse gas emission intensity and have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 40% against our 2006 baseline. Along the way, we've also increased our ambition and committed to net 0 emissions by 2050, in line with the science-based target initiatives.\nIn fiscal 2023, we delivered an annual reduction in absolute emissions of 10% through a range of measures, including an increasing focus on the use of renewable electricity. In addition to carbon-related objectives, we maintain robust targets for reducing water and waste. 100% of our sites have a water management plan in place and 143 of our sites have achieved 0 waste to disposal certification, which is an increase of around 20% in the last 12 months.\nTransitioning to Slide 13. We also continue to make significant progress in supporting the development of circular systems and what we believe are the 3 requirements for responsible packaging. Package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Amcor's industry-leading innovation capabilities position us well to develop the more sustainable and high-performing packaging consumers are looking for, and we believe this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth and differentiation.\nToday, almost all of our Rigid Packaging and Specialty Carton portfolios are fully recyclable. Looking at our Flexibles portfolio, 61% of fiscal 2023 sales were recycle-ready according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation definition, meaning these solutions are designed to be recycled using current technologies where infrastructure is available. Additionally, another 28% of sales had recycle-ready alternatives available, providing a meaningful growth opportunity when our customers are ready to transition more of their portfolios to sustainable solutions.\nIn total, 89% of our Flexible Packaging portfolio is designed to be recycled or has a recycle-ready alternative, a 6 percentage point increase over fiscal '22. Our use of recycled content also continues to grow, increasing by 29% over fiscal '22, reflecting our commitment to work closely with customers to reduce the use of virgin materials. Over the past 4 years, we've more than tripled our use of recycled material, and we're confident we'll achieve 30% recycled content across our portfolio by 2030.\nWe also continue to leverage our position as an industry leader and trusted resource to help our customers navigate their sustainability journeys. As an example, in fiscal '23, we hosted several Amcor webinars, which were attended by hundreds of customers; and covered topics such as the use of recycled content in food contact and health care packaging and the impact of evolving regional regulations on packaging options. Through these efforts, we're reinforcing our value proposition and helping customers accelerate conversion of their packaging portfolios to comply with emerging regulations and to meet their own sustainability goals.\nWe take pride in the strides we've made across all aspects of our sustainability journey. We eagerly anticipate the opportunities ahead, which will continue to differentiate Amcor and also advance our growth objectives, all while contributing to the creation of a circular economy for the packaging industry.\nIn summary, on Slide 14, fiscal '24 has started in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our earnings and cash flow guidance today as we continue to have confidence and visibility to solid earnings growth in the second half. We're making good progress on our sustainability agenda and we remain focused on our strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation.\nOperator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

I would now like to turn the call over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mandeep, and thanks, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal '23 Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation.\nRemarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details.\n[Operator Instructions] Over to you, Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining, Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2023 and June quarter results. We'll begin with some prepared remarks, starting as we always do with safety on Slide 3.\nSafety is our most important value at Amcor, and throughout fiscal 2023, we again made strong progress on our journey for continuous safety improvement across the company. 69% of our sites remained injury free for at least 12 months, and we reduced injuries globally by 31%. While we're pleased with these results, ultimately, it's not just the number of injuries we're focused on but also the severity of the injuries that do occur. Tragically, in June, a contractor's employee lost his life at our Pondicherry site in India after falling from a roof.\nWe immediately conducted a detailed investigation, and we're deploying the learnings across all Amcor sites with the goal of eliminating the risk of similar accidents in the future. We are relentlessly focused on safety globally, and this tragic incident is a stark reminder of the importance of those efforts.\nMoving to our key messages on Slide 4. First, Amcor delivered solid operating performance for the 2023 fiscal year. Adjusted EBIT was up 1%, and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our industry-leading dividend. Across the organization, our teams demonstrated agility by taking action to navigate highly challenging and volatile market dynamics characterized by ongoing inflation, softening consumer demand and customer destocking, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year.\nOur ability to modestly grow adjusted EBIT under these circumstances was the result of proactive and decisive actions to effectively manage the areas under our control, which is our second key message. Our teams did an excellent job prioritizing pricing to recover increases in raw materials and general inflation. And as we entered the 2023 calendar year, we stepped up the intensity of our cost reduction efforts to drive productivity benefits. Additionally, we invested in structural initiatives, including strategic plant closures that will deliver meaningful cost savings in fiscal '24 and '25.\nThird, as a result of these comprehensive actions, Amcor is well positioned to return to solid mid-single-digit earnings growth in the second half of fiscal '24, which also leaves us well placed to grow at our long-term trend of high single-digit rates thereafter. While we expect current market conditions to persist over the near term for the entire industry, we'll continue to recover inflation and are confident the benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a sustainable positive impact on earnings leverage.\nAdditionally, we'll be cycling weaker volume comparatives in the second half and the headwinds we faced from the sale of our Russian plants and significantly higher interest expense are largely limited to the first half of fiscal '24. All these known benefits are largely within our control and underpin our expectation of a return to solid earnings growth in the second half without having to rely on a significant change in the demand environment. And finally, as we and the entire CPG industry continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment, Amcor remains laser focused on executing against our long-term growth and value creation strategy.\nWe're well positioned as a recognized industry leader, and we continue to pursue opportunities to invest in our strong underlying business, particularly through innovation and sustainability initiatives in faster-growing, higher-value markets. We're also actively pursuing value-creating M&A, such as the deal announced last week to acquire Phoenix Flexible Packaging in the high-growth Indian market, and we're committed to returning cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend and share repurchases.\nMoving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Fiscal '23 and June quarter financial performance was well within our May guidance range as proactive cost and price actions helped counter ongoing inflation and increasingly soft and more volatile volumes as we progress through the year. Reported net sales for the year were up 1%, which includes an unfavorable currency impact of 3% and approximately $775 million of pricing to recover higher raw material costs. Organic sales were flat on a comparable constant currency basis as volumes were 3% lower, offsetting a price/mix benefit of around 3%.\nFull year adjusted EBIT of $1.6 billion was up 1% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from strong operating leverage in the first half of the year and accelerated cost actions in the second half. Adjusted EPS of USD 0.733 per share was down 2% on a comparable constant currency basis.\nFor the June quarter, sales were down 5%. Positive price and mix of approximately 2% included recovery of $100 million of general inflation, and volumes were at the lower end of our expected range, down 7%. Last quarter, we referenced accelerated demand weakness in March and April, and this persisted broadly through the June quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and continued customer destocking including in priority categories, which also impacted mix compared with last year. While earnings were in line with our guidance, the June quarter is historically Amcor's strongest of the year, making it more difficult to flex costs. As a result, weaker volumes had a more pronounced impact on earnings and adjusted EBITDA of $436 million was 7% lower than the prior year on a comparable basis.\nWe continue to execute well on our capital allocation priorities, returning approximately $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders during the year through a combination of dividends, which the Board increased to $0.49 per share and the repurchase of approximately 41 million shares or 3% of shares outstanding for a total cost of $431 million. Since 2020, we've repurchased approximately 11% of our outstanding shares, and our industry-leading dividend currently yields around 5%. Our overall financial profile also remains robust with return on average funds employed of 15.4%.\nSlide 6 highlights the proactive actions we continue to take to manage the areas under our control. We've been successful in pricing for inflation throughout the year, passing through a total of $1.1 billion to compensate for higher raw materials and general inflation, including labor, energy and freight. We also delivered more than $200 million in annual cost savings through productivity initiatives including a reduction of more than 1,200 full-time employees. And we're investing in structural initiatives that will deliver approximately $35 million in savings, primarily in the second half of fiscal '24, with an incremental $15 million benefit in fiscal '25. And importantly, we expect the benefits from these fiscal '23 cost actions and structural initiatives to have an ongoing favorable impact on earnings leverage.\nI'll turn it over now to Michael to cover more of the financials.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, Ron, and hi, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7. Fiscal '23 reported sales were in line with last year, which included recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $515 million, accounting for 5% sales growth. Excluding the raw material impact and negative currency movements, sales grew 1% for the year, driven by price/mix benefits of 4%, reflecting our ability to continue to price to recover inflation across all Flexibles business groups. This was partly offset by 3% lower volumes.\nAnd while volumes in all regions were impacted by slower demand and destocking, particularly in the second half of the year, our strategic focus on higher-value priority categories continue to drive solid sales growth for the year. Volumes in the pharmaceutical and pet care categories were especially strong, helping to limit the impact of broad-based lower volumes in other categories. As Ron mentioned, throughout the year, the business did a good job aligning operating costs with challenging market conditions, while pricing to recover inflation. This focus resulted in a 1% increase in adjusted EBIT for the year on a comparable constant currency basis. Margins remained strong at 12.8% despite 100 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars from passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nIn terms of the fourth quarter, net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were down 5% with positive price/mix of 2% more than offset by a 7% decline in volumes. This represents an accelerated volume decline compared with the March quarter and was consistent trend across most regions. The greatest sequential declines continue to be seen in the North America and European markets. Our overall June quarter volumes were lower by high single digits, consistent with softer retail scanner data and with categories such as premium coffee, protein and health care also being incrementally impacted by customer destocking. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $387 million was 7% lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of lower volumes, unfavorable mix and ongoing inflation partly offset by benefits from continued pricing and cost actions.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. Fiscal '23 reported net sales were 4% higher than the same period last year, including approximately $260 million or 8% of sales related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs.\nOrganic sales declined 3%, reflecting 4% lower volumes, partly offset by a price/mix benefit of 1%. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the year were down 6%. Hot fill volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking.\nIn specialty containers, volumes were lower than last year, with growth in the health care, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in food, home and personal care. And in Latin America, volumes were down low single digits versus last year, which reflects challenging macroeconomic conditions across the region.\nFiscal '23 adjusted EBIT was down 7%, and strong earnings growth in the first half was more than offset by challenging market conditions that accelerated through the second half of the year. Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points from the increased sales dollars related to passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nLooking at the June quarter. Comparable constant currency net sales were down 4%. Price/mix benefits of 2% were more than offset by a 6% volume decline as lower consumer demand and customer destocking continued to impact the business, particularly in North America. On a comparable currency basis, adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $73 million was down $22 million against the strong comparative period. As Ron mentioned earlier, the June quarter is typically the seasonally strongest of the year, and together with volatility in customer order patterns, this limits the ability to fully flex costs. In an environment where production volumes are weaker, fixed cost absorption is also significantly lower, and the combination of these factors amplifies the impact on earnings.\nThe team continued to manage the cost under their control well with additional head count reduction as in more plant shutdown days. And we continue to focus on cost actions as we manage through this cycle of softer demand and destocking. Looking ahead to the September quarter, we do not anticipate market challenges to materially improve, which will have an unfavorable impact on earnings compared with the same quarter last year.\nMoving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9. Our financial profile and investment-grade balance sheet remains strong. Leverage of 3x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis is modestly up from last year but is aligned with our expectations given the softer demand and broad-based destocking through the supply chain.\nAdjusted free cash flow of $848 million was in line with our updated outlook now below last year. This reduction mostly reflects lower accounts payable balances as we moderated our purchasing activities partly to reduce inventories but also in response to the soft demand environment. This is a timing impact, which we expect will abate as we progress through fiscal '24. And whilst we have made good progress bringing down our inventory balances with a reduction of more than $400 million from the peak levels in November 22, we will continue to focus on reducing overall working capital to support increasing cash flow.\nTurning now to the outlook for fiscal 2024 on Slide 10. For the '24 fiscal year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $0.67 to $0.71 per share. This includes expectations that organic growth from the underlying business will be in the plus or minus low single-digit range as volumes are expected to remain weak particularly in the first half. Share repurchases will result in a benefit of approximately 2%, and currency translation is expected to add a further benefit of 2%, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the fiscal year. This is expected to be offset by a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our 3 plants in Russia in December 2022 and a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense.\nAs U.S. dollar renewal interest rates have continued to rise, we expect interest expense for fiscal '24 to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million. In terms of cash flow, we expect to generate significant adjusted free cash flow in the range of $850 million to $950 million in fiscal '24, which represents growth of up to $100 million over fiscal 2023.\nWe have planned to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in '24, and we have been active on the acquisition front, and we'll continue to pursue M&A opportunities. And as always, we'll evaluate our uses of cash as we progress through the year.\nSlide 11 shows that Amcor has a long history of delivering solid and consistent earnings growth, and the phasing of the earnings across the year has also been relatively consistent year-to-year. For fiscal '24, it's important to call out that phasing of comparable earnings growth is not expected to align with historical trends. We do not expect the challenging market dynamics we've seen in the last 2 quarters to meaningfully improve in the near term, and in the first half, we assume mid- to high single-digit volume declines. Given this demand outlook and the unfavorable impact related to higher interest expense, which is expected to moderate in the second half, we anticipate adjusted EPS in the first half of fiscal '24 to be down in the high single-digit to low double-digit range on a comparable constant currency basis when compared to the prior year.\nWhile it's more difficult to predict consumer demand, we do expect customer inventories will have largely normalized by the time we enter the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, we have a number of tailwinds in the second half, all of which are within our control, including the benefit of approximately $35 million from structural cost saving initiatives building through the year, increased earnings leverage resulting from ongoing benefits from price and cost actions, a reduced interest headwind, and favorable prior year volume comparatives. The combination of these known factors supports our expectation that adjusted EPS rose mid-single digits in the second half of fiscal '24 on a comparable constant currency basis. It also gives us confidence in resuming our long-term trend of high single-digit earnings growth shortly thereafter. It's also important to highlight here that we do not need to see a significant change in the demand environment to return to solid earnings growth in the second half and beyond.\nSo in summary, we believe the current industry and Amcor specific challenges will primarily be limited to the 2023 calendar year. We remain laser focused on doing all we can to mitigate the impacts of these challenging conditions while continuing to execute our long-term shareholder value creation strategy. And we expect to return to our historic high single-digit organic growth trajectory as we progress through calendar year 2024.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back to Ron to provide some longer-term comments.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Michael. Turning to our long-term commentary. Slide 12 highlights our strategic areas for investment where we see faster-growing, higher-value opportunities to drive sustainable growth. On prior calls, we've covered opportunities in health care and in M&A, and today, I'll take a few minutes to talk about protein and the opportunities we see to deliver strong growth in the high-value protein category.\nMoving to Slide 13. The protein category for Amcor includes packaging solutions for processed and fresh beef, pork, poultry and seafood. And we like this category because it's a large addressable market, which historically has grown globally at attractive rates, driven mainly by an increasing percentage of the world's population able to afford to add protein to their diet. We also like the fact that there are many ways to differentiate and add value for customers since protein packaging requires specialized, more sophisticated and increasingly more sustainable solutions to preserve and protect these premium products.\nAmcor's unique product offerings have enabled us to successfully grow our participation in the meat category over several years. Annual revenue from the sale of processed and fresh meat packaging now exceeds $1 billion. While inflationary impacts are currently creating challenging market conditions, looking forward, there are several reasons we believe Amcor can drive growth at a mid-single-digit CAGR over the medium term with margins accretive to our overall average.\nFirst, Amcor is well positioned with a comprehensive product portfolio for processed and fresh meat applications, underpinning our development of better products, our strong capabilities and significant investments in innovation, sustainability and technical service. These are critical in an industry that relies on durable, high barrier solutions to preserve shelf life while providing convenience for the consumer in environmentally friendly formats.\nSecond, we have a strong presence in North America, but our global scale and reach enables us to leverage our R&D network and installed capacity to transfer technical and process knowledge across regions as we actively pursue global growth opportunities.\nAnd third, there's a unique go-to-market model in some parts of the world where equipment purchases drive the subsequent sales of packaging films and technical services. Our recent acquisition of Moda positions us well because we're now able to provide a wholly owned turnkey equipment solution aligned with this model, where efficiency and the ability to automate are some of the highest priorities for customers. With the recent investments to enhance our offering and go-to-market strategy, we're well positioned to grow in this high-value market, and we're excited with the many opportunities to firmly establish Amcor as a preferred provider of fresh and processed meat packaging solutions globally.\nI just want to spend a minute on sustainability on Slide 14. We continue to make excellent progress supporting the development of circular systems through the 3 pillars of our responsible packaging strategy: package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. And we've made significant advances -- advancements on the innovation and design front by developing more sustainable packaging solutions and increasing our use of recycled materials. We'll provide a more detailed update in our sustainability report, which is expected to be published in October.\nAnd we've continued to collaborate with other industry leaders in various ways across the value chain to help support the development of the infrastructure required for a circular economy. For example, in May, Amcor, Delterra, P&G and Mars formed a strategic partnership to help reduce plastic waste in the Global South by providing access to waste management and recycling systems and by enhancing consumer education.\nWe're also partnering with Licella and Mondelez to help promote a circular economy by bringing onstream one of Australia's first chemical recycling facilities. This is an exciting development in a market where Amcor's portfolio of recycle-ready flexible packaging solutions is already well above 90% and will provide local access to food-grade recycled material.\nSo closing on Slide 15, our teams are doing a good job navigating challenging industry dynamics by continuing to recover inflation and proactively taking actions to align costs with market conditions. We're confident in our long-term growth strategy. We have good visibility to factors well within our control that will see us returning to earnings growth aligned with our historic performance and our shareholder value creation model.\nAnd operator, with those opening comments, we're now ready to open the line for questions."

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Amcor Ltd.\n\nThanks, Christie, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's fiscal 2023 Third Quarter and Year-to-date Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, Amcor's Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. .\nBefore I hand over a few items to note on our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation.\nRemarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates and reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details.\n[Operator Instructions] With that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining, Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's March quarter and year-to-date results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks, starting as we always do with safety on Slide 3. .\nSafety is our most important value at Amcor, which means our commitment to keeping our coworkers safe is unwavering. We're highly proactive in our approach to continuous safety improvement and our results continue to be rewarded. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we reduced injuries globally by 23% compared to last fiscal year and 64% of our global sites have been injury-free for 12 months or more.\nWhile these are excellent industry-leading results and a reflection of our commitment to mitigating risk and protecting our people, the journey towards 0 injuries continues. Turning to our key messages on Slide 4. First, Amcor's portfolio is well positioned and is primarily exposed to consumer staples and health care end markets. We have leadership positions in several strong underlying businesses, a compelling customer value proposition and differentiated execution capabilities, all of which contributed to solid financial performance for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023.\nThat said, we're not completely immune to broader market challenges, and we were cautious heading into the third quarter. Market dynamics led to increased volume softness and volatility throughout the quarter, particularly in the month of March, and our updated outlook assumes this continues through the balance of the fiscal 2023 year. Against this backdrop, our teams remain laser-focused on supporting decisive price and cost actions. The recovery of higher input costs remains a top priority, and we're also taking a range of actions to flex and reduce operating costs while advancing structural cost reductions.\nThese actions give us confidence that earnings growth will build as we progress through fiscal '24. Importantly, we remain focused on executing against our strategy for long-term growth and value creation. We have a strong, well-positioned business, and while we navigate short-term challenges, we'll continue to reinvest for organic growth, pursue M&A opportunities and/or repurchase shares and pay a compelling and growing dividend.\nMoving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Reported net sales for the first 9 months were up 4%, which includes an unfavorable currency impact of 4% and approximately $750 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Organic sales were up 2% on a comparable constant currency basis and volumes were 2% lower.\nFor the March quarter, sales were up 1% on a comparable constant currency basis, with volumes down approximately 3.5%. In both periods, price/mix benefits of around 4% included recovery of general inflation, which has totaled approximately $240 million on a year-to-date basis and approached $100 million for the quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.2 billion and EPS of $0.541 per share were both up 4% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from strong operating leverage in the first half of the year.\nIn the March quarter, adjusted EBIT of $382 million was down 2.5% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. A modest decline as proactive cost actions helped offset significant headwinds related to a challenging operating environment. We continue to execute well on our capital allocation priorities, returning approximately $745 million of cash to shareholders during the first 9 months through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe ramped up our share repurchases during the third quarter, and year-to-date, we've bought back 18 million shares for a total cost of $200 million and our overall financial profile remains robust with return on average funds employed above 16%.\nNow turning to Slide 6. I want to provide a bit more color on what we've seen through the third quarter, and more importantly, the decisive actions we're taking and will continue to take. Three primary factors influenced our performance in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments in the quarter.\nFirst, the general market remains soft and more volatile, leading to lower volumes from a combination of weaker consumer demand and further destocking. Last quarter, we highlighted that demand would be a critical driver of our financial performance, and we expected Q3 and Q4 volumes could be in the range of plus or minus low single digits.\nIn January and February, volumes were tracking at the lower end of those expectations down between 1% and 2%, then weakened through the month of March to be down almost 7%. Volatility in customer order patterns also increased throughout the quarter, most notably in our Rigid Packaging North American beverage business.\nOur teams are adept at flexing the cost base to match anticipated demand although more volatility in orders compromises the ability to pull the appropriate cost levers quickly enough in response, leading to operating inefficiencies. Second, mix trends were unfavorable across much of the business. Destocking continued in higher-value premium coffee and protein categories. And although health care continued to contribute solid growth, it was at a slower rate as we begin to lap a very strong prior year.\nOur North American beverage business also experienced unfavorable product and customer mix. And third, cost inflation is ongoing as we expected. While the rate may be moderating in some areas, inflation remains elevated in most of our markets. So these impacts are not entirely new, and we saw the need for caution at the back end of last quarter and have been out in front, proactively managing the controllables and taking decisive pricing cost actions, which continued in Q3.\nFirst, we've successfully driven more than $1 billion of price on a year-to-date basis to compensate for higher raw materials and general inflation, and we'll continue to take further actions where inflation persists. Second, we continue to actively flex and reduce operating costs. We've reduced our global headcount by more than 1,000 positions, lower discretionary spending, increased the number of full or partial plant shutdown days and extracted more procurement benefits.\nYear-to-date, these efforts have lowered costs by approximately $140 million. We expect to drive additional cost savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million across the business in Q4, including a further reduction of approximately 200 positions. And third, as we've previously announced, we're also pursuing a range of structural cost savings initiatives. And to date, we've announced 3 plant closures and 1 partial closure, and we could add more depending on how the demand environment evolves.\nWe expect to deliver at least $50 million in cost savings from these structural initiatives, which will begin to benefit earnings in fiscal '24, primarily in the second half. We expect current market conditions will persist in the near term, so we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can control and responding with actions. I'll now turn it over to Michael to cover more of the financials.\n\nMichael Casamento\n\nThanks, Ron, and hi, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7. Year-to-date reported sales grew 2%, which included a recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $490 million, representing 6% sales growth. Excluding the raw material impact of negative currency movements, sales grew 3%, driven by favorable price/mix benefits across all Flexibles business units, partly offset by 2% lower volumes. .\nOur strategic focus on higher-value priority categories has continued to drive year-to-date sales growth, particularly strong volume growth in the health care and pet care categories has helped limit the impact of lower volumes in other categories such as protein and premium coffee.\nThe business has continued to show solid operating cost performance and recovery of inflation, resulting in a 5% year-to-date increase in adjusted EBIT on a comparable constant currency basis. Margins remained strong at 12.4% despite the 80 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars from passing through higher raw material costs.\nIn terms of the third quarter, a few call outs worth touching on. Net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 2% higher, reflecting positive price/mix benefits. Volumes were down 3% in the quarter as market conditions led to a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking to varying degrees across all Flexibles businesses. This compares to a 1% reduction in volumes in the first half of the year, with the greatest sequential declines in Europe and North America, where compared with the same quarter last year, volumes were down mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively.\nIn both regions, the overall trends towards lower volumes and month-to-month variability is consistent with retail scanner data with categories such as premium coffee and protein being incrementally impacted by customer destocking. This also contributed to unfavorable mix in the quarter, along with expected slowing of growth rates in health care as we cycled strong growth in the prior year.\nAdjusted EBIT for the quarter was broadly in line with the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting unfavorable volume and mix trends and ongoing cost inflation. This was offset by continued pricing actions and benefits from cost productivity and cost reduction initiatives, which increased as we progressed through the quarter.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. On a year-to-date basis, net sales were 8% higher than the same period last year, including approximately $260 million or 11% of sales related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Organic sales declined by 2%, reflecting 3% lower volumes, partly offset by 1% price/mix benefits. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the first 9 months were down 5%, hot fill volumes were up 2% and are significantly up over the past 2 years, with growth in key categories, including isotonics, juices and ready-to-drink tea, offset by lower cold fill container volumes, which reflects a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking.\nSpecialty container volumes were comparable with last year, and Latin America volumes were down 2% with challenging economic conditions leading to lower consumption across most of the region. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT was in line with last year as strong earnings growth in the first half was offset by a more challenging March quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.2% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points from the increased sales dollar related to passing through higher raw material costs.\nLooking at the March quarter, Comparable constant currency net sales were down 4% with continued soft consumer demand and customer destocking driving volumes lower in both North America and Latin America. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was down $7 million on a constant currency basis, reflecting unfavorable volume and mix trends and ongoing cost inflation. This was partly offset by benefits from cost reduction initiatives.\nAnd as Ron mentioned earlier, volatility has been particularly notable in North America beverage business, with order patterns changing on a week-to-week basis, significantly impacting our ability to flex costs quickly enough in response.\nCombined with mid-single-digit volume declines and unfavorable customer product mix trends, this has had a meaningful impact on operating leverage for our beverage business than we have seen in other businesses. As market-driven consumer demand remains soft and customers continue to reduce inventories, the business took a range of actions to lower costs, including reducing headcount.\nAcross the network this year, the business has also taken temporary plant shutdowns to better align production with lower demand where possible and to prioritize our inventory reduction efforts. Looking ahead, the June quarter is typically the seasonally strongest quarter for North America beverage business.\nThis year, based on continued challenging market dynamics, we expect volume weakness with increased volatility mix challenges and ongoing inflation to persist through the U.S. summer and we anticipate the need to continue reducing inventories through the June quarter.\nAs a result, relative to what we have seen in the March quarter, we expect this combination of factors to have a larger unfavorable impact on June quarter earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9.\nOur financial profile remains strong with leverage at 3.1x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, broadly in line with last year and where we would expect it to be at this time of year. Year-to-date cash flow remains below last year, mostly related to lower accounts payable balances as we moderate our purchasing activities, partly to reduce inventories, but also to reflect the soft demand environment.\nThis is a timing impact, which will abate in the coming quarters. We are already making good progress on inventories with balances coming down over the last several months, and we expect a further reduction in the June quarter. Our cash flow is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, and we expect adjusted free cash flow in Q4 to be broadly in line with last year. This brings me to our outlook on Slide 10.\nGiven our expectation that current market conditions will persist in the near term, leading to a mid-single-digit overall volume decline in the fourth quarter, we are updating our guidance range for adjusted EPS to $0.72 to $0.74 per share assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through the balance of the year.\nWe also expect full year adjusted free cash flow in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes our updated expectations on timing for working capital improvements. The slide lays out the elements making up our guidance. We expect a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases and earnings from the underlying business to be in line with last year, notwithstanding the significant market challenges we faced and will continue to face through the balance of fiscal '23.\nAs Ron mentioned, we have already passed through more than $1 billion in price related to raw materials and general inflation and delivered $140 million of cost reductions year to date and we expect to deliver an additional $50 million to $60 million in cost savings across the business in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year, we've also highlighted the significant nonoperating headwinds we faced from higher interest expense and the divestiture of our 3 plants in Russia, which will be absent or significantly reduced in the second half of fiscal '24. But combined with the benefits from the proactive actions we are taking in response to current market conditions, we are confident that earnings growth will build as we progress through the 2024 fiscal year. With that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRon Delia\n\nOkay. Thanks, Michael. While we navigate a challenging environment in the short term, we have a strong foundation, and we remain committed to our strategy of driving long-term growth and profitability. And that strategy consists of investments in both organic growth and strategic M&A. .\nOn previous calls, we've highlighted the importance of our priority categories, emerging markets and innovation in helping deliver organic growth and better mix over the longer term. And our financial results over the years have demonstrated the success of that focus. For the longer-term comments today, I want to highlight how M&A complements each of these areas and spend a little time outlining our approach to delivering additional growth through acquisitions.\nTurning to Slide 12. Disciplined M&A has been a part of Amcor's playbook for a long time. Our history of successful deal execution and integration has helped us establish or build industry-leading positions, support earnings growth and drive consistent value creation.\nOur model starts with strategic fit. We look across a number of factors when prioritizing opportunities, including businesses where Amcor or the target has a leadership position, where the target can complement our existing footprint or where we gain access to a new customer base or new technologies.\nSecond, in terms of financial strategy, we have been and will continue to be highly disciplined. We target all deals to deliver a double-digit return on the cash investment and well above our cost of capital within 3 to 5 years. And third, our investment-grade balance sheet and strong annual cash flow provide ample capacity and access to financing to continue to pursue M&A or share repurchases in addition to investing in the base business and funding the dividend. And we've been quietly active on the acquisition front. Last week, we signed a deal to acquire Moda Systems, a New Zealand-based manufacturer of high-performance vacuum packaging equipment for the fresh meat, poultry and dairy markets, with machines currently installed in a number of geographies, including North America.\nThis is a small but important acquisition, which will complement Amcor's existing strength in film enabling us to offer a total system solution for automated protein packaging. Other recent deals over the past 9 months include the acquisition of Shanghai-based medical packaging company, MDK in January, a deal that checks all the boxes to reinforce a priority category, expand an emerging market and broaden our product technology offering.\nAnd in August last year, we completed the acquisition of a state-of-the-art Flexibles packaging plant in the Czech Republic which increases our capacity to service strong growth in end markets, including pet care and coffee from a highly efficient, scalable production hub in a low-cost region.\nOn the corporate venturing side, our teams have done an excellent job identifying opportunities to help fund, support and learn from new external developments that have the potential to become smart, functional and sustainable packaging solutions in the future. M&A and corporate venturing are integral parts of our growth agenda and looking forward, we'll continue to be active, but also strategic and disciplined.\nBefore we turn to questions, just a minute on sustainability on Slide 13. We continue to advance our sustainability agenda on a number of fronts, and our success in supporting customers transition their own portfolios to more sustainable solutions and reduce their carbon footprints has recently been acknowledged by several important industry third parties.\nEarly in 2023, our innovation and sustainable product design leadership was highlighted by the World Packaging organization with Amcor's AmPrima and AmSky recycle-ready product platforms named as winners in 3 categories. In February, the CDP or carbon disclosure project awarded Amcor and A- as part of its annual ratings. And this superior grade recognizes Amcor's ongoing sustainability commitment and achievements, including our pledge to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050 and our new target to use 30% recycled material across Amcor by 2030.\nAnd also in February, Amcor's leadership in responsible packaging and overall commitment to ESG was recognized by MSCI with a AA rating, marking the fifth consecutive year that we received the ranking. In summary, on Slide 14, the market remains challenging, but we're well positioned and confident in our ability to manage through this short-term period while continuing to generate value for our customers and shareholders.\nMost importantly, we believe the actions we're taking now will result in earnings growth building as we progress through fiscal '24, and we remain focused on delivering against our strategies for long-term growth, including executing well on M&A, and expanding our leadership in sustainability. Operator, with those opening remarks concluded, we are ready to open the call to questions. Operator, we're ready to open the line for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nHead of IR, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal '23 First Half Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on the call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation.\nRemarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. And reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q, for further details.\n(Operator Instructions) With that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Tracey. And thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's first half financial results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAnd I'll start with Slide 3, which covers our first and most important value, safety. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture, and our management teams understand our collective responsibility to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Our dedication to eliminating injuries in the workplace continues to result in industry-leading metrics.\nIn our first half, we improved further and made great progress with a 24% reduction in the number of injuries globally compared to last year. And 65% of our global sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months, with more than 30% injury-free for 3 years or more.\nSafety and a culture of caring for our people will always be our highest priority.\nTurning to our key messages for today on Slide 4. First, the business delivered a strong first half and second quarter despite ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving value for customers while managing the many aspects of the business under their control. We've increased our focus on flexing costs as demand evolved, and we're proactively taking actions to drive further efficiency and productivity improvements while recovering general inflation and passing through higher raw material costs. The outcome was strong operating leverage, with an 8% increase in both EBIT and adjusted EPS in the first half on a comparable constant currency basis.\nSecond, although not entirely immune in a weakening demand environment, our business remains resilient. 95% of our portfolio is exposed to consumer staples and health care end markets which, combined with our broad geographic footprint, positions us well through economic cycles. Our volume performance through the first half demonstrates that resilience and compares favorably to the mid-single-digit or higher declines reported by others in our value chain.\nThird, a solid first half, strong execution and a resilient portfolio gives us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance ranges for fiscal '23. We're confident in the ability of our teams to continue focusing on the controllables. However, we're also mindful that, through the second quarter, the demand environment softened and became increasingly volatile. We expect this will continue in the near term. And as we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're more cautious in relation to the demand outlook, and we currently expect to be toward the lower end of our EPS guidance range.\nAnd our final and most important key message is that we remain focused on executing against our strategy for long-term growth. The business generates significant annual cash flow, which allows us to invest in organic growth opportunities, pursue acquisitions, pay an attractive and growing dividend and regularly repurchase shares. We're confident in the strength of our underlying business, execution capabilities and capital allocation framework, all of which support our compelling investment case.\nMoving to a few financial highlights on Slide 5. First half reported net sales were up 6%, which includes approximately $670 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Excluding this impact, organic sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and volumes were 1% lower.\nBoth the Flexibles and Rigid segments did an excellent job driving price and mix benefits, including recovering around $160 million of general inflation. We're making good progress on our commercial and strategic agenda and, with our priority segments, continuing to deliver high single-digit organic growth and several of our emerging markets businesses also growing at high single-digit rates in line with long-term trends.\nPositive price/mix performance more than offset modestly lower overall volumes, which reflected generally softer and more volatile demand as well as customer destocking in parts of the business. Operating leverage was strong as we continue to increase our focus on costs, and the business delivered an 8% increase in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the first half.\nLooking at our December quarter financial performance. Reported net sales growth was 4% and 1% on an organic basis, adjusted EBIT and EPS each grew 7%, so another solid quarter highlighting the benefits of geographic diversification and exposure to more defensive end markets even as we experienced softer demand.\nThrough the first half, Amcor returned approximately $400 million of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And today, we've increased our planned repurchases for fiscal '23 by up to $100 million. Our overall financial profile remains robust with return on average funds employed at 17%.\nWe're pleased with our first half and our December quarter financial performance, and I'll now turn it over to Michael to cover more of the specifics.\n\nMichael John Casamento\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Ron. And beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6. The business performed well in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, executing to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improve cost performance and deliver solid mix benefits. Reported first half sales grew 5%, which included recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $460 million, representing 9% of growth.\nOur teams continue to do an excellent job passing on increases in commodity costs. And as expected, the related price-cost impact on earnings for the second quarter was modestly positive after being neutral in Q1. Excluding the raw material impact and negative currency movements, sales grew 3% for both the first half and December quarter driven by favorable price/mix benefits of 4%, partly offset by modestly lower volumes.\nAs Ron mentioned, sales across our higher-value priority segments, which include health care, pet care and protein, remained strong, collectively growing at high single-digit rates through the first half and contributing to positive price/mix.\nWe also continued to see strong growth in our businesses in India and Southeast Asia, particularly in health care and media end markets. This helped limit the impact of lower volumes in some business units across categories, including coffee, dairy, condiments, confectionery and home and personal care where we have seen varying degrees of customer destocking or lower demand. Volumes were lower in China due to COVID-related lockdowns and in Latin America where inflationary pressures unfavorably impacted demand in several countries.\nIn terms of earnings for Flexibles, we again demonstrated strong operating leverage. Adjusted EBIT of 8% for the half reflects ongoing price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins remained strong at 12.6% despite the 120 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. The business built on its first quarter performance with another quarter of solid earnings growth. First half sales increased by 12% on a reported basis, which included approximately $210 million or 13% of sales related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Organic sales declined by 1% for the half, reflecting 2% lower volumes, partly offset by a 1% price/mix benefit.\nLooking at the December quarter, overall volumes declined by 5%, with the beverage business in North America and Latin America impacted by lower consumer demand and customer destocking. In North America, first half beverage volumes were down 5%. This included hot fill container volumes, which increased 2% in the half but were down 2% in the December quarter, which was in line with market. Cold fill volumes were lower in the half and quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking. In Latin America, volumes were marginally higher for the first half with growth in Mexico and Argentina offset by lower volumes in Brazil. Consistent with what we saw in the Flexibles segment, the December quarter was unfavorably impacted by softer consumer demand in the region.\nThe Specialty Containers business delivered good performance with solid volume growth from health care, dairy and nutrition end markets. And overall adjusted EBIT for the Rigid segment in the first half increased 7% on a comparable constant currency basis, with our teams being able to adjust to evolving market conditions and improve operating cost performance.\nMoving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 8. We had a strong sequential improvement in adjusted free cash flow, which came in at $338 million for the December quarter, in line with last year. For the half year, cash outflow of $61 million was lower than last year, largely reflecting the unfavorable impact on the working capital cycle related to higher levels of inventory and higher raw material costs. These impacts also make our cash flow seasonality, which is typically weighted to the second half of the year, more pronounced for fiscal '23.\nOur financial profile remains strong with leverage at 2.8x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis. This is in line with our expectations for this time of year given the seasonality of cash flows and the receipt of proceeds from the Russia business sale. We repurchased $40 million worth of shares in the December quarter and expect to repurchase up to $500 million in total through the 2023 fiscal year.\nPrior to turning to our outlook, I wanted to provide a few more comments about the completed sale of our Russian business. We received sale proceeds of $365 million, in addition to $65 million of cash which was repatriated upon completion.\nIn terms of the use of total proceeds received, we expect to do 3 things. First, we will invest approximately $120 million in a range of cost-saving initiatives across the business to partly offset divested earnings. This is in addition to approximately $50 million of cash we allocated back in August for similar initiatives. Second, we plan to allocate up to $100 million for additional share repurchases. And finally, the balance is expected to be used to reduce net debt in proportion with divested EBITDA, maintaining our leverage ratio.\nTaking us to the outlook on Slide 9. We are maintaining our guidance range for adjusted EPS of $0.77 to $0.81 per share, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through the balance of the year. As Ron mentioned, while we are taking aggressive action now to flex the cost base across the business, we expect the environment will remain volatile in the near term. And entering the second half of the fiscal year, we are more cautious in relation to the demand outlook and currently expect to be toward the lower end of our EPS guidance range.\nOur earnings bridge on this slide lays out the elements underlying our expectations. We expect earnings growth of approximately 3% to 8% on a comparable constant currency basis to be comprised of approximately 5% to 10% growth from the underlying business and a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases. This will be partly offset by a negative impact of approximately 4% related to higher estimated interest and tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be lower than last year, in the 18% to 19% range. However, the year-over-year benefit this provides is more than offset by higher interest expense.\nNow that we have clarity on the timing of the sale, we expect a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the divestiture of our 3 plants in Russia. In addition, the U.S. dollar has weakened since our last update, and we now expect a negative impact of approximately 4% from currency translation movements.\nWe are also reaffirming our adjusted free cash flow range for the year of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, although likely towards the lower end of the range, as noted on last quarter's call.\nSo in summary from me today, the business has delivered another solid result, and we remain focused on supporting our customers and taking actions to continue recovering inflation and flex the cost base. Balancing these priorities will leave our business well positioned as we navigate through higher-than-usual volatility in demand and macroeconomic challenges in the near term.\nWith that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, Michael. And in previous quarters, we've highlighted multiple drivers of organic growth, which you see on Slide 10, and include priority segments, emerging markets and innovation. Before we open the line to questions, I want to just take a few minutes to talk about one of our most important priority segments, which is health care.\nAn overview of our global health care packaging business is shown on Slide 11. With more than $1.8 billion in annual sales in fiscal '22, our portfolio covers both Flexible and Rigid Packaging formats and is evenly split between medical device and pharmaceutical packaging. This is a truly global business with global customers and globally recognized products and technology platforms and it's one where we have scale in every region, including in emerging markets.\nThis is not an easy market to enter because health care packaging is also highly complex with many functional demands, quality standards and regulatory requirements. This complexity provides ample opportunities to differentiate and add value through our industry-leading product innovation, material science and global regulatory capabilities and makes health care a strong contributor to Amcor's growth profile from both a volume and mix standpoint. It also supports strong collaboration with customers, leading to a book of business that tends to be more consistent over the medium and longer term.\nMoving to Slide 12. Globally, health care packaging is a substantial market with significant headroom and growing at mid-single-digit rates over time, and we're investing to capture more of that growth. As an example, in the December quarter, we localized thermoforming production in Europe at our medical packaging site in Sligo, Ireland. This is an exciting project that leverage the experience and technical know-how of our sites in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. As a result, our European business and customer base will now benefit from local access to a broader range of specialized health care packaging solutions.\nIn another organic growth example, we opened a world-class dedicated health care greenfield plant in Singapore at the end of calendar 2021, enhancing our ability to serve the rapidly growing Asian market.\nM&A also plays a role in supplementing organic growth in this segment. A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Shanghai-based MDK, a leading provider of medical device packaging in the China market. This is a great acquisition that enhances our leading position in the broader Asia Pacific medical packaging market by adding product capabilities and a complementary customer base.\nDrilling down a little more on sustainability and moving on to Slide 13. Across all substrates and end markets, the sustainability of packaging solutions continues to be a critical consideration for customers, consumers and regulators. Our collective objective is to create a truly circular economy for the packaging industry. And the solution is responsible packaging, including package design, infrastructure development and consumer participation.\nIn terms of package design, Amcor is well positioned as a leader in the industry. Today, nearly 100% of our rigid packaging and specialty cartons products and more than 80% of our flexibles products are designed to be recycled or have a recycle-ready alternative. This matters because as deadlines to meet previously established goals rapidly approach, customers are increasingly adopting more sustainable solutions.\nAs an example, this quarter, Mars adopted AmFiber performance paper for part of their confectionery range in the Australian market, and Ferrero Rocher launched an AmFiber pilot in the European market. These 2 companies joined Nestlé, who initiated a global transition to paper-based packaging for one of their core brands in 2022 and are now adding a pilot for the KitKat brand.\nWe've also seen important progress in the development of the infrastructure and technology required to produce recycled materials. While the use of food-grade recycled PET is growing rapidly, including in our Rigid Packaging business, the ability to produce recycled content for and from flexible packaging will be a critical ingredient to creating circularity. Significant strides are being made in advanced recycling technologies, which enable use of recycled content and flexible packaging applications where mechanically recycled material may present regulatory or technical challenges.\nTo meet ongoing demand for more recycled material and to support infrastructure and technology development, Amcor continues to increase our long-term offtake commitments. In December, we announced a 5-year extension of our partnership with ExxonMobil to purchase certified circular polyethylene, giving us line of sight to significant quantities of recycled material that can be used in health care and food-grade packaging applications.\nWe also recently announced a partnership with Licella to further explore an investment in one of Australia's first advanced recycling facilities. These agreements provide another point of differentiation and value, which can be applied across all end markets for customers like Mondelez who've incorporated 30% advanced recycled material into their packaging for the Cadbury Dairy Milk brand in the U.K. and Australia. These capabilities also position Amcor to meet the sustainability goals we share with our customers and to contribute to a truly circular economy for the packaging industry.\nTurning to Slide 14. The opportunities and investments I've outlined today in our health care business, our innovation across a range of substrates and our increasing access to advanced recycled materials are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway, giving us confidence that we have built and continue to build a strong foundation for growth and value creation. We don't expect to be immune to macroeconomic challenges, but we believe we're well positioned with a resilient portfolio and multiple drivers of growth, including cost productivity. Additionally, our consistently strong cash flow provides the ability to reinvest in the business, to pursue acquisitions, repurchase shares and grow the dividend, all of which positions us well to generate strong and consistent value for shareholders over the long term.\nAnd finally, in summary, on Slide 15, we've delivered a strong first half in a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging. We're more cautious on the demand environment entering the second half, but our portfolio leaves us well positioned. And most importantly, we remain focused on executing against our strategies for long-term growth.\nOperator, with those opening remarks, we're now ready to open the call to questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nHead of IR, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions.\nThe second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates and reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tracey. Thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's first quarter financial results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAnd I'll start with Slide 3, which covers our first and most important value, which is safety. The first quarter showed continued progress on our long-term objective of eliminating injuries across our global operations. Our teams are doing a good job proactively identifying and addressing potential risks, and the results are evident with a further 31% reduction in the number of reported injuries globally compared to last year. This good work has also led to a solid increase in the number of our sites that have been injury-free for the past 12 months or more, which stood at 63% at the end of the quarter. Our top priority will always be the well-being of our 44,000 global employees and achieving our goal of 0 injuries.\nTurning to our key messages for today on Slide 4. First message to leave you with is the business has delivered another strong quarterly result, highlighting the relative stability of our end markets, our relentless focus on recovering higher raw material costs and staying ahead of inflation and our proactive approach to driving costs out of the business in a volatile and challenging operating environment. The result was another quarter of strong operating leverage with 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share on a comparable constant currency basis.\nSecond, we're confident in our ability to sustain solid organic earnings growth from the underlying business in fiscal '23. We've reaffirmed our guidance ranges for comparable constant currency EPS growth and free cash flow while updating our reported EPS guidance to reflect further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We assume the macroeconomic environment will remain challenging. However, our continued focus on sustainability, innovation and higher growth, higher value-add segments, combined with our proactive approach to managing costs, supports our confidence in delivering against our expectations for the year.\nThird, our attention to sustainability is unwavering. We understand our role in supporting the circular economy, and we continue to improve the sustainability profile of our products. And finally, we want to leave you with a good understanding of why we're confident that Amcor's strong resilient business will drive long-term shareholder value creation.\nMoving to some of the first quarter financial highlights on Slide 5. We've had a strong start to the year. On a constant currency basis, net sales growth was 15%, which includes approximately $400 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Excluding this pass-through impact, organic sales grew 3%. Both the Flexibles and Rigid segments generated price mix benefits and have done an excellent job recovering general inflation of approximately $75 million as a result of nonmaterial costs increasing at double-digit rates. Overall volumes were marginally lower, reflecting somewhat softer and variable customer demand through the quarter.\nAs I mentioned earlier, operating leverage was strong with solid top line growth and proactive delivery of cost efficiencies in both businesses, driving EBIT up 9% and adjusted earnings per share up 10%. We continue to expect to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders this fiscal year through approximately $400 million of share repurchases and a growing dividend, which increased to $0.1225 per share this quarter. And our financial profile remains strong with return on average funds employed at 16.5%.\nWe're pleased with our first quarter financial performance, and we'll now turn it over to Michael to cover more of the specifics, including our fiscal '23 outlook. Michael?\n\nMichael John Casamento\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Ron, and hello, everyone. Turning to our Flexibles segment performance on Slide 6. Our Flexibles business had another excellent quarter with all business units delivering solid organic sales growth while executing well on inflation recovery, cost initiatives and mix management. Net sales were up 6% on a reported basis, which includes recoveries of higher raw material costs of approximately $270 million, representing 10% of quarterly sales growth.\nThe teams have continued to successfully manage the pass-through of higher raw material costs. And as expected, the related price cost impact on earnings for the quarter was relatively neutral. Excluding the raw material impact, organic revenue growth of 3% was driven by favorable price mix benefits of approximately 4%, partly offset by lower volumes.\nSome business units experienced lower demand in certain categories during the quarter. However, our broad market coverage and geographic diversification limited the overall volume impact. Sales across our combined priority segments grew high single digits for the quarter, with health care a particular standout, delivering strong sales and volume growth across every region.\nIn our Asian business, overall volumes were higher than the prior year despite lower volumes in China, which was impacted by ongoing COVID-related lockdowns.\nAdjusted EBIT was up 11% in comparable constant currency terms for the quarter, reflecting overall sales growth, price mix benefits and outstanding cost performance, including quick actions taken to flex the cost base in regions where the operating environment has been more challenged. Adjusted EBIT margin of 12.7% was comparable to last year, notwithstanding the 130 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars associated with passing through high raw material costs.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. The key takeaway for Rigids is the business delivered another quarter of solid sales and earnings growth. Reported sales were up 19%, which included the pass-through of higher raw material costs of approximately $130 million or 17% of sales. Excluding this pass-through, organic sales growth of 3% was driven by price mix benefits of 2% and volume growth of 1%.\nIn North America, we had positive product mix in the beverage business with hot-fill volumes up 6%, reflecting growth across a range of categories, including sports drinks, juices and ready-to-drink teas. From an overall standpoint, beverage volumes were lower than last year, reflecting a decrease in lower value cold fill and preform volumes.\nIn the Specialty Container business, volumes increased mid-single digits led by strength in health care, dairy and nutrition markets. And in Latin America, volumes were up high-single digits with strong performance in key countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 7% on a comparable constant currency basis driven by higher overall volumes, strong inflation recovery and continued solid operating and cost performance. EBIT margins were 7% and over the past several quarters have been negatively impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to a sharp increase in resin pricing being passed through the sales line and significantly increasing sales dollars as a result.\nIn terms of the balance sheet on Slide 8, we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating, which provides us with flexibility to invest for growth and access to lower cost debt markets across key currencies. Leverage at the end of the quarter was 3x and right in line with our expectations for this time of year given the seasonality of cash flow.\nAnd as we highlighted in August, free cash flow was lower than the same quarter last year as we expected. Our cash flow is typically weighted to the second half of the year. And in fiscal 2023, the seasonality will be more pronounced given higher raw material costs and the decision to increase inventory levels through last year to offset some of the volatility created by supply constraints.\nWe have reaffirmed our full year cash flow guidance with [Cranes] , which I'll come back to shortly. Notwithstanding the temporary increase in inventory levels, we remain highly focused on working capital performance, which is particularly critical in this inflationary environment, and we've maintained our 12-month average working capital sales ratio at 8%.\nIn August, we announced an incremental investment in ePAC and the purchase of a Flexibles plant in the Czech Republic and funded both of those investments in the September quarter for a total of around USD 100 million. And while we did not repurchase any shares during Q1, we continue to expect to allocate approximately $400 million towards share repurchases in fiscal '23.\nTurning now to Amcor's outlook for fiscal '23 on Slide 9. While we expect market conditions to remain challenging through 2023, we have had a strong start to the year. And taking into account the relative stability of our end market exposures and our strong track record of consistent execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against the outlook we provided in August. We have reaffirmed our expectations for organic growth of 5% to 10% from the underlying business and a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases while continuing to expect an impact from the following 3 nonoperating items.\nFirstly, a negative impact of approximately 4% from higher interest expense after tax. Forward curve expectations have continued to move higher and interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. Net of our expectations for a slightly lower effective tax rate, we continue to expect a 4% headwind to EPS, as we noted in August.\nSecond, an estimated 2% negative impact from the scale down and sale of our 3 plants in Russia, which we continue to expect in the second half of the fiscal year. And third, a negative currency translation impact of 5%, which is higher than the 2% we anticipated back in August due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result of this U.S. dollar strengthening, we are updating our expectations for adjusted EPS on a reported basis to be $0.77 to $0.81 per share.\nIn terms of cash flow, we continue to expect a seasonally stronger second half, and we have reaffirmed our adjusted free cash flow expectations to a range of approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion. However, the stronger U.S. dollar pushes our current expectation toward the lower end of the range.\nSo in summary for me today, the business has delivered another strong quarter of organic sales and earnings growth as we remain focused on executing for our customers, managing margins and taking decisive actions to rapidly recover inflation while flexing our cost base. Our ability to successfully balance these priorities supports our confidence in delivering another year of solid underlying growth despite persistent market challenges.\nWith that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nOkay. Thanks, Michael. Before we open the call to questions, I'd like to cover some of the drivers that inform how we think about our growth over the longer term and are relevant for our fiscal '23 outlook as well.\nFor several periods, we've highlighted multiple commercially oriented drivers that have enabled us to deliver solid and sustainable organic earnings growth over the last 3 years. These drivers include opportunities in priority segments, emerging markets and innovation and they've not changed. And when combined with our ability to deliver continual cost improvements by leveraging our scale advantages and capabilities, these drivers give us the confidence we'll continue to consistently deliver solid organic earnings growth from the underlying business even in the face of continued challenging and evolving macroeconomic conditions.\nOur focus on priority segments, including protein, health care, premium coffee, pet food and hot-fill beverages, will continue to be a driver of growth and mix benefits. With more than $4 billion in collective annual sales, we have leading positions in each of these large addressable markets that have been growing at higher than market rates for us historically. And over time, we expect they'll continue to grow at mid-single-digit rates with higher-than-average margins. As Michael mentioned, health care was a particular standout in the first quarter with strong growth across all regions.\nEmerging markets also continue to be a focus for Amcor. We have a large-scale diversified emerging markets portfolio, which generates annual sales of more than $3 billion. And this is another source of organic growth. And over the long term, we expect these markets collectively will continue to grow at mid-single-digit rates. In the last quarter, several emerging market countries delivered double-digit earnings growth, including India, Brazil and Mexico.\nInnovation provides a third opportunity for us to drive growth and value, particularly as customers and consumers focused on the critical need for more sustainable, high-performance packaging solutions. Amcor has industry-leading R&D and material science capabilities and expertise. And when coupled with our unmatched scale and geographic reach, these capabilities provide unique ongoing opportunities to develop differentiated products to meet the needs of our customers.\nFor example, we're winning new business by taking fresh protein packaging solutions initially developed by the legacy Bemis business into the Asia Pacific market, including modified atmosphere packaging solutions in China and the Eco-Tite high barrier recyclable films in Australia. And a cross-functional Amcor team came together to partner with Pfizer to develop packaging for the first commercial batches of Paxlovid in the U.S. market. Leveraging technology developed by our teams in Europe and our global footprint, we were able to start production of living and base material at the same time in 5 Amcor sites across 5 countries in order to fully meet Pfizer's requirements in 1/3 of the standard lead time.\nLooking ahead, the strategic choices we've made to focus on these organic growth drivers will guide how we prioritize investments back into the business. We see a wide range of attractive growth opportunities across each of these areas. And we're actively investing to sustain the organic growth momentum we've built over several years.\nBefore closing, a few words on sustainability. Sustainability is fundamental to everything we do and is deeply embedded in Amcor's strategy and risk management framework and the basic start within our own operations. Our 2022 sustainability report will be released in a few weeks and will highlight some of the important progress we've made through the year.\nThis includes reaching a cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity of 35% since the launch of Amcor's enviro-action program in 2008. A critical journey will continue through our commitment to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050.\nIn addition to carbon-related objectives, we maintain robust targets for reducing water and waste and achieved significant milestones during the year. A few weeks ago, we also released our first TCFD report, highlighting the important work we're doing to help ensure we make the right decisions on climate and packaging sustainability.\nTurning to Slide 12. We continue to make progress supporting the development of circular systems through the 3 pillars of our responsible packaging strategy: innovation, infrastructure and consumer participation. Today, nearly 100% of our rigid and specialty carton packaging portfolios are fully recyclable. And in our Flexible Packaging segment, 83% of our product portfolio is designed to be recycled or has a recycle-ready option available for trial.\nIn fiscal '22, we used more than 130,000 metric tons of PCR, up 30% from the prior year and representing 6% of our total resin usage. And we're now building and increasing on our objectives with a new commitment that 30% of our total resin used will be recycled material by 2030.\nIn one example to bring this focus on recycled content to life, we've worked closely with Mondelez on the recent launch of packaging for several Cadbury Dairy Milk products, incorporating 30% food-grade recycled content in both the U.K. and Australia. This is an important example of how a combination of strong relationships, differentiated capabilities and a global footprint can translate into volume growth and mix benefits for Amcor.\nWe've also continued to collaborate with others to support the development of recycling infrastructure. On October 12, Amcor was the only packaging company to join 11 brand owners in the Consumer Goods Forum to publicly signal a commitment towards further increasing the use of recycled materials in packaging. Together, we expressed our common interest in purchasing commercial volumes of chemically recycled plastic and our support for the development of credible, safe and environmentally sound chemical recycling infrastructure. Our sustainability journey is ongoing, and our long-term strategy is helping to create a responsible packaging industry for the benefit of Amcor and its customers but crucially for the environment as well.\nTurning to Slide 13. We've built a strong foundation to deliver growth and value creation, and we've consistently executed well against our strategy. We don't expect to be immune to economic challenges and uncertainties but we believe we're relatively well positioned with the defensive consumer staples and health care-focused portfolio and multiple drivers of growth and cost productivity. And our consistently strong cash flow provides the ability to reinvest in the business, to pursue acquisitions or repurchase shares and to grow the dividend and positions us well to generate strong and consistent value for shareholders over the long term.\nIn summary, on Slide 14, despite a continued challenging economic backdrop, we've had a strong start to the financial year. Our consistent execution has enabled us to deliver solid sales growth and excellent operating leverage, resulting in double-digit organic EPS growth. We're confident in our ability to deliver against our outlook for EPS growth and free cash flow, which we've reaffirmed today. And we're executing well to deliver long-term value for shareholders, including by making further progress against our sustainability agenda.\nAnd operator, we're ready to open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nTracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nHead of IR, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's June quarter earnings call for fiscal '22. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on the call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and presentation.

And reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, over to you, Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's financial results for fiscal 2022. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAnd kicking off with Slide 3, which covers safety, our first and most important value. Throughout fiscal 2022, we continue to make good progress on our long-term objective of eliminating injuries across our global operations. The focus of our teams on implementing additional safety best practices resulted in a further 3% reduction in the number of reported injuries globally, and I'm pleased to report that well over 50% of our sites continue to be injury-free for the past 12 months or more. We pride ourselves on making the well-being of our 44,000 global employees our #1 objective and we'll continue to strive to achieve our goal of no injuries.\nTurning to our key messages for today on Slide 4. First, FY '22 has been another outstanding year for Amcor. We could not be more pleased with how our teams have demonstrated remarkable perseverance and agility, continually adjusting to challenges in the operating environment from raw material shortages to high inflation while remaining focused on driving value for our customers and our shareholders. As a result, financial performance was strong with growth across all key metrics. The business finished the year with good momentum, more than offsetting any external headwinds so that Q4 was our strongest quarter of sales and EBIT growth, and full year EPS growth of 11% was at the top end of our guidance range.\nSecond, we expect the business to continue performing well, and we anticipate sustaining strong underlying growth in FY '23. And finally, we have a resilient and compelling investment case, which has consistently delivered significant shareholder value through a combination of organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and cash returns to shareholders.\nTurning to some financial highlights for the year as outlined on Slide 5. In short, we've added to our track record with another year of sustainable growth in the underlying business. Focusing on the strong June quarter, net sales growth was 13%, and this included approximately $1.7 billion of incremental price increases on an annualized basis related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Excluding this pass-through, organic sales growth accelerated through the year, reaching 6% for the June quarter in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments. And our strong performance reflects good work by our teams to recover broader and higher levels of general inflation, mostly through the second half of the year. It also reflects favorable volume and mix benefits.\nAnd as we have in the past several quarters, we benefited from mid- to high single-digit growth in high-value priority segments, which confirms that our focus on these faster-growing markets is paying off. This top line growth converted into adjusted EBIT growth of 9% in the June quarter, and it's worth noting that this high single-digit earnings growth was achieved in a quarter which clearly no longer benefited from any synergies and while we continued to experience significant inflation and an unfavorable price/cost lag related to raw materials.\nFlexibles delivered outstanding EBIT growth of 11% in the quarter, and in line with our expectations, earnings growth continued to improve in Rigid Packaging. For the full year, net sales growth was 13% and 4% on an organic basis, which represents our third consecutive year of accelerating top line growth. Adjusted EBIT of $1.7 billion was 7% higher than the prior year, and adjusted EPS of $0.805 per share was 11% higher than 1 year ago. Our financial profile remains strong with return on average funds employed at 16.3%, and we also returned more than $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a higher annual dividend.\nNow before handing over to Michael for more detail on the financial results, let me provide an update on our business in Russia. As previously announced, we've been exploring all strategic options for our Russian business. And after a thorough assessment, we've decided to sell our 3 manufacturing sites in Russia. Until completion, which we expect will occur in the second half of our 2023 fiscal year, we remain committed to supporting our employees and customers while preserving value for shareholders through an orderly sale process. We're also proactively undertaking initiatives to help offset the future impact of the divested earnings, including optimizing our European footprint and adjusting our regional cost base.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Michael, who will cover the estimated impact of this sale on fiscal 2023 guidance.\n\nMichael John Casamento\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Ron, and I'll begin with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6. Performance throughout fiscal '22 was excellent across several different dimensions as each one of our businesses responded quickly to the continued evolving market environment, implementing measures to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improve cost performance and deliver increasing mix benefits. Year-to-date sales of $11.2 billion includes significant recoveries of higher raw material costs of $1.1 billion. The overall price/cost impact has remained a manageable headwind through this inflationary cycle, given the diversity of raw materials we buy, the multiple reasons in which we consume those materials and the leverage we get from our well-developed and deeply embedded capabilities, which have enabled us to implement a range of pricing actions across the business in a timely manner.\nExcluding this raw material impact, we are very pleased with the organic sales growth, which was delivered across all Flexibles business units as well as the momentum built through the year as we focused on successful recovery of rising general inflation and optimizing mix benefits. Organic sales growth was 4% for the year and 6% in the June quarter, representing the strongest quarter of growth for the year. The strong mix benefits, in part, reflect continued growth in priority segments, including health care, pet food, meat and coffee. We have made deliberate choices to focus on these segments and through the year, have seen organic sales growth in the mid- to high single-digit range across these categories.\nMore broadly, supply chain disruptions had a dampening effect on growth in certain high-value categories through the year, including in the June quarter. As a result, year-to-date and June quarter volumes across the Flexibles business were in line with last year. Faced with these constraints, we proactively took action in parts of the business to direct constrained materials to their highest values, further enhancing mix. In terms of earnings, adjusted EBIT growth of 9% on a year-to-date basis and 11% for the June quarter reflect strong price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins also remained strong at 13.6% despite an adverse impact of 150 basis points from the mathematical consequence of pass-through pricing for higher raw material costs.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. The key messages today are the underlying demand has remained elevated across North and South America through fiscal '22, leading to continued sequential strengthening in our earnings growth in the June quarter, in line with our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, reported sales grew by 20%, which includes approximately 16% related to the recovery of higher raw material costs. The 5% organic sales growth was driven by favorable price/mix benefits of 2% and volume growth of 3%. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes were up 1%, hot fill container volumes increased by 2% for the year against a strong comparative period of double-digit growth and were up 4% in the June quarter, reflecting continued strength in categories like isotonics and juice.\nBy leveraging Amcor's highly differentiated technology, design and PCR handling capabilities, we are well-differentiated and adding significant value for our customers in the hot-fill segment, which over a multiyear period has resulted in compound volume growth of around 5%, helping drive consistent fixed benefits. Specialty container volumes continued to improve throughout the year, including in the June quarter, but on a full year basis, remained below the prior year, which benefited from a strong first half in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered double-digit volume growth for the year, supported by higher volumes in all countries we operate in the region. And the June quarter marked the highest level of volume growth for the business this year, led in part by strength in Brazil.\nTurning to earnings. In line with our expectation, operating conditions and financial performance in the North American business improved through the second half of the year after being adversely impacted by industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions as well as capacity constraints in the first half. As a result, the overall business delivered adjusted EBIT growth of 4% in the second half, with growth improving sequentially and reaching 5% in the June quarter.\nMoving to the cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. We continue to generate strong free cash flow even as we step up our capital investments and compensate for additional working capital needs from higher raw material costs and supply constraints. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, in line with the expectations and broadly in line with fiscal 2021. We are pleased with this result, given we've won the unfavorable working capital impact of higher raw material costs throughout the year and have also proactively increased inventories across the business to help offset some of the volatility created by supply constraints. Our working capital performance remains a top priority, one even more critical in this inflationary environment. And despite these challenges, we've been able to maintain a 12-month average working capital to sales ratio below 8% and in line with last year.\nWe also see ample opportunity to increase investments in strategic growth projects, which generate strong returns in excess of 20%. This led to a 13% increase in capital investments during the '22 fiscal year, and as we've previously communicated, we will continue to step up investments to support future organic growth. We maintain an investment-grade credit rating, which gives us access to funding through the cycle of competitive rates, and approximately 54% of our debt is fixed. Leverage at 2.7x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis was in line with our expectations at year-end. And the balance sheet is extremely well positioned with only 1 maturity in the next 18 months being a EUR 300 million bond in March '23.\nWe continue to deliver on our investment case, returning meaningful capital to shareholders during fiscal '22 year through repurchasing $600 million worth of shares and raising our annual dividend per share to $0.48. In total, we are pleased to have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in fiscal '22.\nTurning now to Amcor's outlook for fiscal 2023 on Slide 9. We expect adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 to $0.84 per share on a reported basis. This includes growth of 5% to 10% from the underlying business and a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, offset by 3 nonoperating items: the first, the negative impact of approximately 4% from higher interest expense, which is based on the assumption that interest rates increased in line with the current market forward curve expectations; second, an estimated 2% negative impact from the scale-down and planned sale of our 3 plants in Russia; and third, a 2% negative impact related to a stronger U.S. dollar, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the fiscal year.\nIn terms of cash flow, we expect to continue to generate significant adjusted free cash flow for the year of approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion, even as we fund a further 15% increase in capital investments to capture organic growth opportunities. While Amcor's cash flows are typically weighted to the second half, in fiscal 2023, the seasonality is likely to be slightly more pronounced as we intend to maintain higher levels of inventory in the near term before returning to more normalized levels later in the year. As a result, free cash flow in the September '23 quarter is expected to be lower than first quarter of fiscal '22.\nOur strong cash generation enables us to continue paying a compelling and growing dividend and allocate approximately $400 million in cash to share repurchases during the 2023 fiscal year. So in summary from me today, the business has delivered another strong year of organic growth as we remain focused on executing for our customers, recovering inflation and higher raw material costs and increasing earnings leverage by managing mix. Our continued and consistent performance supports our confidence in delivering another year of underlying growth in fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nOkay. Thanks, Michael. Before turning to Q&A, I want to refocus for a minute on the longer term. And our financial performance continues to reflect consistent delivery against our strategy and a resilient investment case, which is shown on Slide 10. And we enter fiscal '23 with leadership positions in most of our chosen primary packaging segments and with over 95% of our sales for consumer staples and health care products.\nWe also have absolute and relative scale advantages in all key regions and industry-leading commercial and innovation capabilities. With this portfolio, we have a long track record through multiple economic cycles of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and significant free cash flow, all while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Our cash flow and balance sheet strength is enabling us to step up investments for growth and continue to return additional value to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and regular share repurchases.\nThe starting point in creating value for shareholders will always be the underlying organic growth of the business. And as we've continually strengthened the base business, including over the last few years with the Bemis acquisition, we've built sustainable organic sales growth momentum. We have multiple drivers of organic growth that have contributed to that momentum and which are shown on Slide 11. We've been focused on these areas for some time and we're investing across each of them.\nFirst, Amcor has leading positions in higher-growth, higher-priority -- higher-value priority segments, including health care, meat, cheese, premium coffee, pet food and hot fill containers. Collectively, we generate more than $4 billion in annual sales across these categories, and they're growing at mid-single-digit rates and offer significant opportunities for differentiation, contributing to margin expansion. Over time, they'll represent a higher proportion of our sales mix and become an increasingly relevant driver of earnings growth.\nWe also have a leading and well-diversified emerging markets portfolio, generating more than $3 billion in revenue, which we expect will also grow at mid-single-digit rates over the long term, as has been the case for many years. And innovation continues to be one of the most critical drivers of differentiation and growth in the packaging industry, and Amcor is coming from a position of tremendous strength with deep R&D talent and capabilities.\nAnd finally, sustainability is fundamental to everything we do from an innovation perspective and remains at the forefront of discussions with global brand owners. As the sustainability leader in the packaging industry, we continue to be the supplier of choice to help our customers achieve their goals in a meaningful way and at scale. Organic growth has accelerated over the last 3 years, and as Michael mentioned, we're stepping up CapEx to around 4% to 5% of sales on an ongoing basis to maintain that momentum.\nIn our industry, there's also a pipeline -- a rich pipeline of acquisition opportunities available to supplement our organic growth. We have a pragmatic and disciplined approach to M&A, and we've completed around 30 deals in the last 10 years, and we continue to be active. Earlier this month, we acquired a world-class flexible packaging plant in the Czech Republic. This plant features state-of-the-art equipment and immediately increases our capacity in Central Europe to satisfy strong demand in priority segments, including coffee and pet food. The acquired land and buildings also provide optionality to scale and potentially consolidate operations in that region while giving us a highly efficient production hub in a strategically attractive lower-cost location.\nWe've also invested in several new opportunities through our open innovation and corporate venturing efforts. These typically start small but we're very excited to have recently increased our strategic investment in ePac, a fast-growing flexible packaging player, leveraging digital technologies to offer smaller production runs and shorter lead times. This increased investment in ePac is an excellent example of our objective to partner with high-growth visionary companies to learn from and to leverage new innovations and business models.\nAs you heard from Michael, we have a strong investment-grade balance sheet, and we expect another year of robust cash flow in fiscal '23, which means we can continue to invest in growth and return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. We're committed to growing our already compelling dividend every year. And Amcor is one of a small number of companies included in the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which recognizes companies with a 25-year or longer history of consecutive dividend increases. Our current yield is especially attractive at approximately 4%.\nAnd we've also been regular -- a regular repurchaser of our own shares, allocating $1.5 billion of cash to share repurchases since 2019. And over that time, we bought back more than 8% of our outstanding shares or roughly 1/3 of the shares that were issued to acquire Bemis 3 years ago. And looking ahead, we expect our strong cash generation to continue supporting regular share repurchases, including approximately $400 million in fiscal '23.\nIn summary, on Slide 14, Amcor had another strong year in fiscal '22, generating sustainable momentum and delivering earnings growth at the top end of our expected range. We expect to deliver another year of strong growth in the underlying business in FY '23. And we're committed to continuing delivering for shareholders by increasing investments in the business and returning value through a compelling dividend and ongoing share repurchases.\nSo with those opening remarks, operator, we can now turn the line over to questions."

My name is Savannah, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Third Quarter 2022 results. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nHead of IR, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our March quarter earnings call for fiscal '22. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I hand over to them, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which will be discussed on the call. Please be aware that we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions.\nThe second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to differ from current estimates. Please refer to our filings on the SEC website or on our own website for further details.\nDuring the question-and-answer session, we request that participants ask their question and then rejoin the queue for any additional questions.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's financial performance at the end of the third quarter. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A.\nAnd since safety is our first and most important value, we'll start on Slide 3 with safety, as we do in every meeting at Amcor. And we believe our ultimate goal of zero injuries is absolutely possible, and we continue to make good progress. So far in fiscal '22, we reduced the number of injuries across the company by 5% compared to the prior year, and more than half of our sites have been injury-free for at least 12 months.\nNow of course, this quarter, our attention has turned to the tragic and devastating war in the Ukraine. We moved quickly to close our Ukraine site in Kharkiv before the start of the invasion to protect our local team. And we continue to support those coworkers and their families in any way we can, including through direct financial support and by assisting those who've been displaced. All up, we've contributed more than $1 million to vital humanitarian relief efforts. We also announced our decision to scale down our operations in our 3 Russian sites and to explore all strategic options for those plants.\nAs always, our path forward will continue to be guided by our values and by our responsibilities to all of our stakeholders. I'd like to publicly thank all of my Amcor colleagues who are contributing from near and far to this challenging and upsetting situation. Your commitment, caring and generosity has been an inspiration.\nTurning to our key messages for the quarter on Slide 4. First, the business delivered another strong result with the March quarter representing our strongest period of sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year so far. Second, our teams have continued to demonstrate an exceptional ability to remain focused on managing sales mix and inflation while delivering for our customers. Third, given the strong execution and consistently strong earnings growth through the year, we've raised our guidance for fiscal 2022 EPS growth. And finally, Amcor has established a strong foundation for growth and value creation over the last several years, and we're increasing capital investments in priority segments and geographies as well as in our innovation capabilities.\nTurning to the financial highlights on Slide 5. March quarter performance was strong across the board, and I'll start with a few highlights. Net sales grew 16% in the third quarter, including more than $450 million of incremental price increases related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Excluding this pass-through, organic sales growth was 5% in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments.\nConsistent with the first half, we continue to benefit from favorable mix as well as actions to anticipate and recover higher levels of inflation than we've seen for many years. This top line growth converted into adjusted EBIT growth of 9% in the quarter. The Flexibles segment delivered EBIT growth of 10%, and in line with our expectations, Rigid Packaging returned to earnings growth after experiencing a unique set of supply chain challenges in the first half.\nAs you see on the bottom of the slide, this strong March quarter builds on a solid first half so that on a year-to-date basis, net sales have increased 13%, adjusted EBIT has increased 6% and adjusted EPS is up 11%. And our financial profile remains strong, and we continue to increase cash returns to shareholders. We expect to repurchase $600 million of shares this year, which when combined with our annual dividend means we anticipate returning around $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders in fiscal '22.\nBefore I hand over to Michael, I want to come back to a slide we presented last quarter, which touches on our priority segments. Amcor has a leading position in each of these categories, which collectively generate over $4 billion in annual sales and share a few common features, including large addressable markets, higher-than-average growth rates and significant room for Amcor to grow and differentiate.\nBy making deliberate choices to focus on these high-value, higher-growth categories, over time, they represent a higher proportion of our sales mix, contribute to consistent margin expansion and become an increasingly relevant driver of earnings growth for Amcor. And we've seen this trend so far this year in both Flexibles and Rigid Packaging, including in the March quarter, and we expect this will continue as we allocate more capital and resources to these segments.\nYou'll hear more about these mix benefits from Michael as he provides some more detail on our financial performance.\n\nMichael John Casamento\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Ron.\nSo I'll begin with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7. The businesses continued to perform very well through the year, executing to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improve cost performance and deliver increasing mix benefits.\nReported year-to-date sales grew 11% and 14% in the March quarter. This includes significant recoveries of higher raw material costs, which increased to $330 million in the March quarter, representing 13% of growth and $1.3 billion on an annualized basis. The overall price cost impact has remained a manageable headwind through this inflationary cycle given the diversity of materials we buy, the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of a range of pricing actions across the business.\nExcluding this raw material impact, sales grew 3% year-to-date and 5% in the March quarter. And as Ron mentioned, this performance reflects our continued focus on managing mix to drive growth, particularly in priority segments like health care, pet food and premium coffee, where we have seen mid-single-digit growth year-to-date.\nSupply chain disruptions have had a dampening effect on our volumes in certain high-value categories through the year. And in parts of the business, we have taken action to direct constrained materials to their highest value use, which further enhances mix. As a result, year-to-date and March quarter volumes across the Flexibles business were in line with last year.\nIn terms of earnings, adjusted EBIT growth of 8% on a year-to-date basis and 10% for the March quarter reflects strong price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins also remained strong at 13.1% despite an adverse impact of 140 basis points from the mathematical impact of pass-through pricing for higher raw material costs.\nTurning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. The key messages today are the underlying demand remains elevated and the business returned to earnings growth in the March quarter, in line with our expectations. Year-to-date sales grew by 19%, which includes favorable pricing to recover higher raw material costs of 14%, and organic sales growth reflects 3% higher volumes and price/mix benefits of 2%. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes were up 2%. Hot fill container volumes increased 6% in the March quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis, which reflects continued growth in key categories like isotonics and juice.\nHot fill containers is a high-value priority segment for Amcor, where we see significant opportunities to differentiate. And over a multiyear period, our ability to leverage technology, design and PCR handling capabilities has enabled us to deliver compound volume growth of 4% and consistently improve mix.\nSpecialty container volumes improved sequentially in the quarter but remained below last year on a year-to-date basis with the prior year benefiting from a strong first half in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered strong double-digit volume growth on a year-to-date basis, reflecting strength in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Peru.\nIn terms of earnings, the North America business was adversely impacted in the first half by inefficiencies and higher costs resulting from industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions as well as capacity constraints. However, operating conditions and financial performance improved in the March quarter, where the Rigid Packaging business delivered adjusted EBIT growth of 4%. We expect this improved performance to continue through the balance of fiscal year '22.\nMoving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9. Free cash flow in the March quarter was $75 million higher than last year, which was a pleasing outcome in the context of continued raw material inflation. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow of $263 million is below last year, primarily due to unfavorable working capital outflows relating to higher raw material costs as well as some planned inventory increases across the business. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance, which is even more critical in an inflationary environment, and our rolling working capital to sales ratio remains below 8% and in line with last year.\nNotwithstanding current high working capital requirements, we have ample capacity to increase capital investment in strategic growth initiatives. Ron will provide some more color on this shortly, but for fiscal '22, we expect capital expenditure will be approximately 15% higher than the prior year. And year-to-date, we are tracking in line with that expectation.\nOur financial profile remains strong with leverage at 3x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is where we'd expect to be at this time of the year given the seasonality of cash flows. And we continue to increase our cash returns to shareholders. So far this year, we've repurchased $423 million worth of shares and expect this will reach $600 million by year-end, and our quarterly dividend per share of $0.12 is also higher than last year's dividend.\nTaking us to the outlook on Slide 10. Given our strong March quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EPS growth to 9.5% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis. This represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.795 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year.\nWe expect significant free cash flow for the year of approximately $1.1 billion, which includes the adverse impact of higher raw material costs on working capital. It is also important to note our fiscal '22 guidance assumes no further earnings from the business in Ukraine in the final quarter and takes into account a range of possible outcomes in Russia.\nAs a reminder, the 4 sites in Ukraine and Russia combined represent approximately 2% to 3% of Amcor's annual sales, approximately 4% to 5% of annual EBIT and approximately USD 200 million to USD 300 million on the balance sheet.\nSo in summary from me today, the business has delivered another strong result as we remain focused on driving value by delivering for our customers, managing mix and recovering general inflation and higher raw material costs. And this strong execution gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the 2022 fiscal year.\nSo with that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Michael.\nBefore turning over to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the longer term, starting with our investment case on Slide 11. We've maintained a consistent strategy that's guided how we've evolved our portfolio over the years so that we're the clear global leader in most of our chosen segments within the primary packaging space for fast-moving consumer goods and health care products.\nWe have absolute and relative scale advantages and a strong track record of earnings growth, margin expansion, significant and growing free cash flow of over $1 billion each year and maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. And that cash flow and balance sheet strength enable us to step up investments for growth to drive increased momentum in the business.\nAt the same time, we have the capacity to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of regular share repurchases and a growing dividend, which currently yields around 4% or double the average of the S&P 500.\nWe continue to see no shortage of high-quality organic growth opportunities across the 3 areas that we've highlighted in previous quarters and which are shown on Slide 12. I already mentioned priority segments, and Michael's comments highlighted the mix benefits that are important -- are an important driver of earnings growth.\nWe also have a leading and well-diversified emerging markets portfolio, which we expect will grow at mid-single-digit rates over the long term. And innovation is increasingly a clear differentiator and growth driver for Amcor, particularly as it relates to the development of more sustainable packaging such as the groundbreaking global product platforms shown on this slide, including AmLite, AmSky and AmFiber.\nAnd Slide 13 is a double-click on AmPrima, another example of a global product platform that sets us up as the partner of choice for customers as we work together to meet our mutual sustainability goals. AmPrima is a family of packaging solutions that are designed to be recycled and deliver significant sustainability benefits without compromising critical performance features, including heat resistance, high barrier, transparency and run speed.\nOver time, we've introduced second and third generations of AmPrima, expanding the number of end market applications and adding recycled content options for certain products and the material structure is now prequalified by the How to Recycle program in the United States.\nVolume growth is now increasing rapidly as some of the most recognizable global brands begin to move from qualification and trial into commercialization. And AmPrima is also a great example of a revenue synergy unlocked by the Bemis acquisition. Capacity was first implemented in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, with some capacity allocated to other regions to seed demand. And as volume commitments have grown, we've scaled up, adding capacity in Europe and soon in Latin America as well.\nMoving to Slide 14 and to dimension the increasing investment we've referred to a few times and to bring it to life with some more examples, we've been stepping up CapEx by around 15% per year, including in the current 2022 fiscal year, as Michael mentioned. And we expect this will take our CapEx to sales ratio from the 3% to 4% range historically to 4% to 5% on an ongoing basis. We have a number of projects already underway or nearing completion, which will generate attractive returns and drive organic growth going forward, and this slide showcases a few examples.\nIn Brazil and in the United Kingdom, we're adding multilayer film capacity to serve growth in the priority health care and meat segments. In Ireland, we're adding new state-of-the-art thermoforming capabilities to strengthen our leadership position in medical packaging. And in Italy, we're adding production capacity for one of our global product platforms, AmLite Heatflex. And since launching this recycle-ready pouch for retortable applications, we've seen significant interest from a long list of customers, and the majority of this new capacity is already sold out.\nJust a few words on our broader sustainability agenda on Slide 15. better package design like AmLite and AmPrima, which takes into account the full product life cycle, is a critical element of responsible packaging. But achieving the type of lasting large-scale impact we envision requires broad cooperation with expert partners from across the value chain. One way we've been most impactful is by bringing our capabilities to the table as standards are developed to make circularity the norm.\nThrough the consumer goods form, Amcor recently contributed to the development of principles for advanced recycling technologies, which can play a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of hard-to-recycle plastic waste. We're also actively contributing to the changes needed in waste management and recycling infrastructure by creating demand.\nIn April, we announced a partnership with ExxonMobil, providing us access to their advanced recycled materials, which can be used in health care and food packaging applications. We have similar agreements in place with multiple suppliers and as we increase our use of recycled materials, the carbon footprint of our products is also reduced. And that reduction, combined with ongoing efforts to make our own operations less energy-intensive, sets us up to achieve our net zero ambitions, which we announced earlier this year.\nTo summarize on Slide 16, Amcor delivered another strong result with the March quarter representing the strongest period of sales and earnings growth for the year. We continue to manage well through inflation and improvements in our sales mix while delivering for our customers. With strong year-to-date performance and good momentum, we've raised our guidance for fiscal 2022 EPS growth. And looking over the longer term, we've built a strong foundation for value creation, and we're stepping up our investments to drive growth, margin expansion and long-term value for shareholders.\nThat concludes our opening remarks. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor 2022 Half Year Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nTracey Whitehead\n\nHead of IR, Amcor Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Amcor's first half earnings call for fiscal 2022. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation, which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and presentation on our website.\nAlso a reminder that the call today includes some forward-looking statements, which remain subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, included -- including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q to review factors that could cause actual results to differ from what we are discussing today. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2022 first half results. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening (inaudible) We'll start with safety, which is where we start every meeting at Amcor. It's the first and most important of our values and keeping every one of our 46,000 employees around the world safe and healthy is our highest priority.\nIn the last 6 months, we reduced the number of injuries across the company by 10% compared to the prior year and 58% of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. Our teams have continued to make good progress on safety despite the complex environment, and we're proud of their focus, dedication and performance. However, our ultimate goal is no injuries, so there is more for us to do.\nWe have 4 key messages set out today on Slide 4 for those following along with the webcast. First, we delivered a solid result through the first half, and we can confidently reaffirm our full year guidance. While we continue to navigate through the challenging and dynamic operating conditions affecting the entire industry, our teams are executing and performing exceptionally well. We continue to prioritize our customers and our scale and operational agility have enabled us to service demand and drive growth in priority segments, while also recovering higher input costs at the same time.\nWe've also increased cash returns to shareholders, which is our second key message. We now expect to return more than $1.3 billion of cash in fiscal 2022 through dividends and share repurchases. Third, we built a strong foundation over the last several years, and we're focused now on investing for long-term growth, with an emphasis on priority segments and geographies and our innovation capabilities. And finally, for many years, we've made great progress against a broad range of sustainability goals, and we're raising our ambitions again with a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nTurning to the financial highlights on Slide 5. We delivered double-digit net sales growth, which includes approximately $650 million of price increases. We remain incredibly proud of our teams and in the tools and capabilities we've developed over many years that enable us to continue recovering and increasing costs in an environment characterized by broader inflation that we've seen for some time. Excluding this pass-through impact, organic sales grew 2% on the back of higher volumes and favorable mix. Both segments in every geographic region contributed to organic sales growth and volume growth accelerated in the second quarter in both our flexibles and rigid packaging businesses.\nThe Flexibles segment had a particularly strong quarter, generating high single-digit earnings growth and margins remain strong. In Rigid Packaging, our results for the half were in line with our expectations. The business continued to experience a particularly challenging environment in North America, which resulted in operating inefficiencies and higher costs, although we're encouraged by a number of favorable trends we've seen through the half and earnings improved as we exited the second quarter.\nEPS increased 9% for the half. Our financial profile remains strong and cash returns to shareholders are significantly higher. We've repurchased almost $300 million of shares in the first half and we expect to repurchase a total of $600 million through fiscal 2022, which is $200 million higher than we anticipated last quarter. Combined with dividends, this means we anticipate returning more than $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders for the fiscal '22 year.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Michael for some further detail on the financial performance.\n\nMichael John Casamento\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Amcor Plc\n\nThanks, Ron. Hi, everyone. And turning to Slide 6 and beginning with the flexibles, the business performed very well through the half year as our teams demonstrated impressive focus when it comes to recovering higher input costs and managing operating performance, whilst delivering growth in higher-value priority segments. Reported sales growth of 10% for the half includes recovery of approximately $480 million of higher raw material costs or 10% growth compared with last year. And in the December quarter, recoveries reached almost $1.1 billion on an annualized basis.\nConsistent with the outcome in the first quarter and as expected, the overall price cost impact in the first half was unfavorable, but remains manageable, given the diversity of materials we buy, the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of a broad range of pricing actions. As a result, margins have remained strong at 12.9%, despite higher raw material costs and related pricing recovery. At $480 million through the half, the top line recovery alone had an unfavorable impact on margins of 130 basis points. Excluding this raw material impact, revenue growth of 2% was driven by favorable mix across the business, and reflects our long-term strategy of optimizing performance through the delivery of consistent growth in priority segments, including health care, coffee and pet food.\nNotwithstanding the dampening effect on volumes that supply chain disruptions had during the period in some categories, including health care and protein products, overall volumes across the business were in line with the first half last year, and we saw low single-digit volume growth in the December quarter. In terms of earnings, adjusted EBIT was up 7% for the half and reflects growth in high-value segments and strong operating cost performance.\nTurning to the Rigid Packaging business on Slide 7. Reported sales grew by 17% in the half, including 13% related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Excluding the raw material recovery, the business delivered year-to-date sales growth of 4% against a strong period of double-digit growth last year, and this included a 3% increase in volumes as well as a 1% price mix benefit. In North America, underlying demand in the beverage business remains strong, and year-to-date volumes were 3% ahead of the same period last year, accelerating to 6% in the December quarter and building on 13% growth delivered in the second quarter last year.\nHot fill container volumes were broadly in line with the second quarter last year, notwithstanding we are cycling growth of almost 30% in the prior year. We have seen good volume growth in isotonics as well as iced tea categories, where customer demand for 100% recycled PET bottles has been strong. Specialty container volumes were lower against the prior year, which also benefited from higher volumes in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered double-digit volume growth reflecting strength in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, and earnings were higher.\nFrom an earnings perspective, the business in North America was adversely impacted as we expected, by inefficiencies and higher costs resulting from industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions. As Ron mentioned, earnings performance improved as we exited the second quarter, and this was helped by a number of positive trends, including better availability of PET resin and new capacity coming online, which also supported our ability to build some additional inventories ahead of the peak summer season. Although the operating environment is likely to remain dynamic and somewhat complex, we anticipate conditions will continually improve, and earnings for the Rigid Packaging segment are expected to grow in the second half compared with the same period last year.\nMoving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. First, as a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year, and this year, we delivered cash flow within our range of expectations for the half, particularly in light of a higher cost environment. First half cash flow was below last year, and this mainly reflects the timing impact of higher raw material costs on working capital across the business, along with planned inventory increases. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance, which is even more critical in an inflationary environment and our rolling working capital to sales ratio remains below 8% and in line with last year.\nAs planned, capital expenditure is tracking higher than last year as we have stepped up organic investments in priority segments and geographies. And Amcor's balance sheet remains strong with leverage at 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is where we'd expect to be at this time of the year, given seasonality of cash flows. Cash returns to shareholders in the first half were almost 50% higher than last year and we increased our quarterly dividend per share and repurchased a greater amount of shares. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we now expect to allocate a total of $600 million towards share repurchases in the 2022 fiscal year, which includes the additional $200 million announced today.\nTaking us to the outlook on Slide 9. The business has delivered a solid result for the half, in line with our expectations, and the outlook for our business remains positive. This enables us to do 2 things today. First, reaffirm the 2022 guidance we outlined in August and November, where we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis, which represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year. And we continue to expect free cash flow in a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.\nSecondly, our positive outlook leaves us well positioned to increase our share repurchase by $200 million in fiscal '22, as previously mentioned. It's important to note the majority of these additional repurchases are expected to take place in the fourth quarter. And due to the limited impact this will have on the weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal 2022, there is not expected to be any real benefit to EPS growth until fiscal '23.\nSo with that, I'll hand back to Ron.\n\nRonald Stephen Delia\n\nMD, CEO & Executive Director, Amcor Plc\n\nOkay. Thanks, Michael. Before closing and turning it over to Q&A, just a few minutes on the longer term, starting with our investment case on Slide 10. And we've maintained a consistent strategy for several years now that's guided how we've evolved our portfolio and developed our capabilities. And as a result, Amcor is better positioned strategically than ever before with a stronger foundation for growth and shareholder value creation.\nWe've managed the portfolio so that we're now the global leader in most of our chosen segments within the primary packaging space for fast-moving consumer goods and health care products. We have absolute and relative scale advantages and a strong track record of performance, and that track record relates to our consistent earnings growth and margin expansion and the significant free cash flow we generate every year. And with a strong balance sheet, we're able to use that cash flow to step up investments for growth including in fiscal '22, where we expect CapEx will be about 15% higher than last year, and we can see that leading to increasing momentum across the business.\nAt the same time, we're also returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of regular share repurchases and a growing dividend. Now organic growth has always been a key driver of our overall financial performance, and we're actively investing in several areas highlighted on Slide 11 that will continue to drive long-term growth.\nFirst, we're strategically focused on the most attractive segments, and this guides how we prioritize investments back into the business. We'll talk more about these segments in a minute. Second, we continue to see tremendous opportunities to invest and extend our competitive advantages in emerging markets. And we already have a leading emerging markets portfolio that generates roughly $3 billion in annual sales and we see no shortage of growth opportunities in these markets, where we expect mid-single-digit growth and good profitability over the long term. Third, innovation in our world-class R&D capabilities remain a clear differentiator for Amcor. Innovation will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward as we partner with customers to develop more sustainable and high-performance solutions for their specific needs and those of their consumers.\nSlide 12 takes a closer look at some of those higher growth priority segments. And these attractive segments are expected to represent an increasing percentage of our sales mix and contribute to consistent margin expansion. And Amcor has a leading position in each of these categories, which collectively generate over $4 billion in annual sales today and would share a few common features. First, these are large addressable markets, each well over $1 billion and the growth rates are all higher than the average across broader consumer markets, meaning there's significant room to grow. There are also many opportunities to differentiate across these categories, given the need for higher performance features such as barrier, heat resistance and resealability, which in turn drives higher margins.\nAnd in order to fully capitalize on the great potential, we're increasingly allocating capital towards these segments. In health care, we're investing to add capacity and capability in Europe and Asia. In this quarter, we celebrated the opening of a state-of-the-art medical packaging facility in Singapore to service accelerating demand in the Asia Pacific region. We recently began ramping up production on new assets in Coffee segment, and we're adding hot fill capacity in our rigid packaging business in North America, given the sold-out environment and positive growth outlook. Over time, we expect mid-single-digit growth in these segments, which will drive continued sales mix improvement and sustainable margin expansion.\nMoving to Slide 13. Sustainability is increasingly embedded in everything we do, and we continue to believe this represents our greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation. We also continue to believe responsible packaging is the answer to addressing concerns around packaging waste. And by responsible packaging, we mean the combination of packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Amcor recently commissioned a global survey, which enabled us to hear directly from 12,000 consumers around the world and provided several powerful insights. Among them, recyclability is considered by far the most important environmental attribute of packaging, more important than which material is used or whether the package is reusable. 3/4 of respondents indicated they would like to recycle more and more than 2/3 said they're willing to pay more for a product for the package that's recyclable.\nNow our package design efforts have always had the consumer front and center, and we're making great progress innovating against those consumer needs. Across our own portfolio, over 95% of our rigid and specialty container packaging -- specialty carton packaging is recyclable today. But our most significant progress over the last 2 years has been in our Flexible Packaging segment, where multiple materials are often required to deliver the required functionality. Today, 76% of our flexible packaging portfolio has a recycle-ready alternative and this represents substantial progress from 56% just 2 years ago.\nAn important contributor to this progress has been the launch and commercialization of new product platforms such as AmLite, AmPrima and AmSky. And last week, we announced AmFiber, a new platform of performance paper packaging. These technology platforms will be leveraged across our global footprint, across multiple categories and for multiple customers to provide the more sustainable and high-performing packaging consumers are looking for and to drive growth and margin expansion for Amcor.\nResponsible packaging is a critical element of our sustainability agenda, but every company's environmental footprint goes beyond the products it makes. And to lead the way and reach our own ambitious goals, we launched Amcor's EnviroAction program in 2008, and since then, we've reduced the environmental impact of our operations by continuously exploring new and more impactful ways to reduce emissions, waste and water at every location. The value created for our customers in the environment through our work on a range of ESG initiatives has been recognized by several independent organizations and Amcor is continuing to demonstrate industry leadership.\nLast week, we increased our ambitions again by committing to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with near and long-term targets aligned with the science-based targets initiative. We're excited to step up our ambitions to further reduce the carbon footprint of our products and operations, and to support our customers as they strive to meet their own goals for functional high-performance packaging with the lowest possible environmental impact.\nAnd finally, on Slide 15 to summarize, Amcor delivered a solid result through the first half as we continue to perform well through challenging and dynamic operating conditions, and we've confidently reaffirmed our full year guidance. We've also increased cash returns to shareholders and expect to return more than $1.3 billion in fiscal '22 through dividends and share repurchases. And looking over the longer term, we've built a strong foundation for growth and value creation over the last several years. We're investing to capture that growth, and we're building on our sustainability progress as we use science-based targets to define our journey to net zero emissions.\nAnd with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We are happy to have you with us today for our Q3 Earnings Call. As we reach the last months of 2025, the 25th year since Exelon's founding, our employees continue to execute with excellence, serving our customers, communities, and shareholders. We reported earnings of $0.86, which was stronger than anticipated due to slightly warmer weather and a mild storm season, along with timing-related drivers. We continue to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance for 2025 of $2.64 to 2.74 per share, and we look forward to closing out the year strong. We also continue to deliver some of the best operational performance in the industry.\nIn fact, we now have the final results of our reliability benchmarking for last year, and our four utility operating companies are ranked one, two, four, and seven out of our peer set, improving upon last year's already stellar one, three, five, and eight rankings. I could not be prouder of the way our employees show up every day, whether it's selecting, planning, and operationalizing the right investments to avoid outages or being the fastest to get customers back online if the power does go out. This performance has real value, particularly when you consider that a typical major storm can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for the average customer, depending on its size.\nOur operational North Star is to continuously improve upon this performance, offering above-average performance at below-average rates to the communities we have the privilege and honor of serving. Results like that show we're living up to that standard. As it pertains to rate cases, we remained on track for our gas distribution rate case at Delmarva Power, and our Atlantic City Electric rate case.\nWe also filed a rate case at Pepco Maryland, with the decision required per statute by August of 2026. The filing supports the company's commitment to delivering safe, reliable, and resilient service while further preparing the local grid for future clean energy demands. Our filing also demonstrates true focus on customer value, reflecting strong O&M cost containment, and robust projected benefits from specified reliability investments that significantly exceed their cost. Outside of rate cases, we have seen more progress in our states and at PJM when it comes to advancing solutions to meet the growing need for reliable and resilient power.\nLast week, Illinois passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which directly supports resource adequacy by expanding the annual budget for energy efficiency, broadens the types of assets eligible for the distributed generation rebate, and creates an energy storage procurement plan. It also requires the commission and other state agencies to develop four-year integrated resource plans and gives the ICC discretion to facilitate transmission projects that support state goals. This marks the next chapter in Illinois' energy transition, and we look forward to working with policymakers on implementing this next set of programs. In Maryland, the commission initiated a request for merchant generator proposals for up to 3GW of new energy supply.\nThe process attracted several submissions, though the disclosed capacity levels have fallen short of their target, and we will learn in December which of those projects the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Power Plant Research Program might recommend. And PJM is working through its critical issue fast path process for options to better accommodate new large loads, assisting our states as they navigate unprecedented levels of growth. We are encouraged by the breadth and amount of engagement in that process, and we look forward to finding solutions that ensure customers can rely on cost-effective power supply. As we have stated, these efforts are welcomed and necessary, but they are not enough.\nThere is a significant anticipated shortfall in supply, and hoping that markets alone will fill it puts too much risk on customers that increasingly depend on affordable supply to power their lives. All states need to leverage all available options to bring control, certainty, and customer benefits to securing power. These options help ensure that all customers continue to have reliable access to energy and that the states can participate more fully in the economic development opportunities from artificial intelligence and onshoring. The supply challenge is real, and we know utilities can be a key partner in helping the states solve it, whether it's supporting investments in the demand side like energy efficiency, distributed and community solar, and storage, or even owning more traditional generation plants.\nWe stand ready to work with our states as they seek opportunities to address growing energy security needs in a manner that fits their goals. The demand for power is not slowing down. Our large load pipeline now stands at over 19GW as we have finalized our cluster study approach and now account for our first transmission security agreement at PECO. The innovative TSA approach ensures we strike the right balance in prioritizing large loads while ensuring our existing customers are protected.\nFurthermore, we now have at least 27GW either waiting signed TSAs or in active cluster studies, with many more behind those. Additional details on our large load outlook can be found in the appendix. Connecting new business is expected to be just one of the drivers of the anticipated growth in transmission investment in our next four-year plan. This new business will also drive broader needs for the grid, which get identified in reliability assessments like PJM's open windows, and it helps drive inter-RTO opportunities like MISO Tranche 2.1 segment running through ComEd territory.\nWe will be monitoring the recommendations coming out of PJM's latest open window over the next three months to determine if any of the solutions we have proposed, either individually or with partners, are selected. With no project greater than 3% of our four-year plan, we are focused on bringing all of our customers along at the appropriate pace, while also ensuring we can earn a fair return of 9% to 10% on the equity capital provided by our investors. With rate-based growth of 7.4% through 2028 and a balanced financing plan, we expect to grow our earnings at an annualized rate of 5% to 7%, with the expectation of always delivering at the midpoint or better of that range. I will now ask Jeanne to cover more details on our regulatory updates and financial performance. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our Q3 financial update along with our financial and regulatory outlook for the remainder of 2025. Starting on slide five, we present our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings block. Exelon earned $0.86 per share in Q3 compared to $0.71 per share in Q3 of 2024, reflecting higher results of $0.15 over the same period. Earnings are higher in Q3 relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.12 of higher distribution and transmission rates, net of associated depreciation, and $0.06 associated with the ability to seek deferral treatment of the PECO extraordinary storms earlier this year and favorable storm conditions at BGE. This favorability is slightly offset primarily by interest expense.\nThese results are ahead of the expectations noted in our prior quarter call, primarily due to better than normal storm conditions, timing of O&M spend, and tax timing at PECO. As we close out the year in the fourth quarter, we remain on track to achieve operating earnings of $2.64 to 2.74 per share with the goal of delivering at midpoint or better. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes the reversal of timing, including O&M, distribution earnings at ComEd, and PECO taxes, fair and reasonable outcomes for open rate case proceedings, including reconciliations at BGE, Pepco Maryland, and ComEd, and normal weather and storm activity.\nFinally, we reaffirm our annualized operating earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that range. Turning to slide six, I will now review the regulatory activity across our platform. Starting with the base rate case activity, we continue to make progress on the Delmarva Power gas distribution rate case filed last September, with the final settlement conferences held in October. As a reminder, the filing seeks to recover reliability investments such as aging pipe replacements, and it also seeks recovery of LNG plant upgrades, which would protect customers from price volatility during peak periods. We anticipate an order in Q1 2026. At Atlantic City Electric, settlement discussions continue as we seek recovery for grid improvements and modernization investments in line with New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the Clean Energy Act. We continue to anticipate an order by the end of the year.\nFinally, on 14 October, Pepco filed an electric base rate case in Maryland, requesting a net revenue increase of $133 million utilizing a fully forecasted test year. The request supports key infrastructure investments to modernize aging infrastructure and improve reliability while also supporting Maryland's clean energy goals. As part of the filing, Pepco, through an independent firm, found that $38 million of investments generate nearly $262 million in benefits to customers through avoided outage and restoration costs, as well as avoided O&M expenses over the next 20 years. The filing also offers a suite of programs and resources that help manage rising energy costs, increase awareness of energy usage, and provide direct assistance to those who need it most.\nPer statute, an order is expected from the Maryland Public Service Commission in August of 2026. Beyond base rate cases at ComEd, we remain on track for our first reconciliation under the new multi-year plan framework, where we continue to robustly support the spend submitted for reconciliation throughout the final briefing process.\nAn ALJ Proposed Order is expected later today, and the ICC will issue a final order by 20 December. In Maryland, we continue to await decisions on our final reconciliations from the first BGE and Pepco Maryland multi-year plans, along with the commission's order on the lessons learned proceeding to support future filings. We look forward to moving forward with an approach that best aligns stakeholders' interests in balancing affordability, reliability, and the state's economic development and energy policy goals. Finally, turning to slide seven, I will conclude with updates on our balance sheet activity, where we've continued to de-risk our financing plan and ensure cost-effective capital to invest for the benefit of our customers. In September, PECO issued $1 billion in debt, completing all of our planned long-term debt issuances for the year.\nThe strong investor demand and attractive pricing we've achieved in our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform. We continue to seek opportunities to take advantage of current market dynamics to de-risk our plan. This includes utilizing our pre-issuance hedging strategy and pricing future equity needs to settle through forward agreements under the ATM, reducing interest rate and share price exposure. Through Q3, we have priced nearly half of our equity needs through 2028, including all of our annualized equity needs in 2025 and $663 million, or 95% of our 2026 annualized equity needs, which we expect to settle next year.\nIn line with our last earnings call, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of financial flexibility on average over the Moody's investment grade threshold of 12%, approaching 14% at the end of our guidance period. We also continue to advocate for language that incorporates all tax repairs for calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax. As a reminder, favorably addressing all repairs in the minimum tax calculation would result in an increase of approximately 50 basis points in our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. As we approach the end of our 25th year at Exelon, we are working to add to our legacy of excellence, delivering on our commitments to our customers, our communities, and our investors. Many of you may have seen us ring the opening bell at Nasdaq last month, and I was honored to represent our company alongside some of our longest tenured employees. Standing next to me were just a few of our more than 2,500 employees who have been with us and our local energy companies for 25 years or more. Our operating companies have over 800 years of collective experience delivering energy to customers provided by dedicated employees who keep the lights on and the gas flowing day in and day out, no matter the conditions.\nAnd they are the reason our utilities are ranked as the best or among the best in the business for reliability. They also can't do it without smart, targeted investments in our grid. It's why 98% of the net profit earned at our utilities generated with fair returns on the shareholder dollars entrusted with us have been reinvested back into the system over the last five years. Those investments not only deliver top-notch service, they also boost local economies, with every $1 million creating eight jobs or $1.6 million of economic output. So we don't take this performance or the responsibility of supporting our communities for granted, and we know it will take continued discipline to ensure that we can provide high levels of service at below-average prices for another 25 years and beyond.\nWe will continue to advocate that our jurisdictions provide fair recovery for our investments with the expectation that service remains high, that we treat all users of the grid fairly and equitably, and that we put our customers first. Our priorities this year do just that: ensure we earn that right to provide our customers top-notch value every day. For example, we continue to focus a dedicated team on pulling cost out of our business to keep cost growth below inflation.\nWe push our business lines to work smarter and leverage technology, providing better service at lower cost. We advocate for rate-making constructs that ensure we can plan, invest, and operate as efficiently as possible, benefiting from alignment and forward-looking planning. We continue to support and leverage customer assistance programs like LIHEAP and to advance rate designs that support the customers who need it most.\nAnd we advocate for fair policies that can equitably serve growing load while instilling greater confidence in resource adequacy. That includes developing our innovative TSA approach, which we have filed for our first customer with FERC and are proposing as part of tariff adjustments at ComEd. And it's why we're increasingly advocating that our jurisdictions take more control over their power supply. They can complement supply induced by better-designed markets with solutions like utility-owned generation that regulators oversee, giving them control, certainty, and cost benefits for customers that markets alone don't offer. We look forward to closing out 2025 strong, earning an ROE aligned with allowed levels in the 9% to 10% range and delivering against our guidance of $2.64 to 2.74 per share, always with the goal of midpoint or better while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nThere would be no better way to celebrate our 25th year as Exelon and further cement our foundation to deliver consistent growth and long-term value for another 25 years. Gigi, we are now ready for questions on the line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star one one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Wells Fargo.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nShar, good morning.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning, Calvin. How are you doing?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI'm good, man. Welcome back.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate it. Luckily, there's no news flow in this space, and it's been kind of relaxing.\nJoking.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThat's just our way of saying we missed you.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I miss you too. I miss you too. So, Calvin, just obviously, resource adequacy was very topical in your prepared remarks. Maybe just starting with Maryland, just your broad thoughts around the RFP. I mean, you've been out there talking about regulated solutions to solve the needs there, and now Constellation just came out with their own solutions, ironically, this morning. Can we just get a sense on how you're thinking about the process, the timing, and then your views on sort of these competing options that were proposed this morning? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, thank you, Shar. And I appreciate the question. Let me first begin by saying that we commend the state of Maryland for initiating the process. And while we appreciate that they received some responses, our view is that they fall short of what's needed for the state and for PJM more broadly. Having said that, we're happy to see that several parties stepped up and actually talked about adding supply. Let's be clear, this is all about solving the problem and bringing energy costs under control for our customers. And that's what we're focused on: affordability and reliability each and every day. Customers have voiced very strongly that they're frustrated with high energy costs, and we are frustrated too. But overall, we are encouraged to see a reply to the RFP.\nLike I said, the disclosed need fell short of the goal, and we'll have to see what the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and other stakeholders recommend to the PSC. We are more than willing to step up. As we've said before, Shar, if the competitive market is willing to step up and fill this need to meet us where we are at this time and not rely on the old rules of the past, we're okay. It's time to move forward and continue to be progressive and aggressive in what we're trying to do for the state.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. That's perfect. That's actually consistent with what you've been saying. And then maybe just, Calvin, shifting to Pennsylvania, there's obviously two bills sitting at the House and Senate around resource adequacy. I think they reconvened in November. I guess thoughts there, and more importantly, can the wires companies kind of strike a middle ground with the IPPs, maybe around a long-term resource adequacy agreement structure that is also being proposed in the legislation versus this kind of push-pull around rate-basing generation or doing nothing and letting the market dictate new builds? So I guess, how are the discussions in Pennsylvania going? Do you think you could strike a deal there?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nFirst off, we are committed to working with all the parties, from the governor's office to the IPPs and, of course, with our peers in the state. Mike Innocenzo, our Chief Operating Officer, is here, and I know he's been a former CEO of PECO. He's been very engaged in that discussion as well. Mike, anything to add?\n\nMike Innocenzo\n\nCOO, Exelon\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Calvin. Thanks, Shar, for the question. Discussions in Pennsylvania continue to go very well. As you're aware, Pennsylvania is a little different space in that they continue to be an exporter, continue to see the value of being an exporter, leveraging our natural resources in Pennsylvania, and continue to see the advantage of being an exporter in terms of economic development and look at that as an opportunity to solve that. There are two active bills, one in the Senate, one in the House, that are being discussed. At the same time, we're talking with the governor's offices about all of the above solutions, including longer-term PPAs, contracts. So I think you'll start to see more activity, probably more likely in the spring.\nCandidly, they're in the middle of budget discussions in Pennsylvania right now, which is taking most of the legislative space. But we've seen some active discussions with the governor's office. In addition, I don't know if you saw that the PUC hired a party to do a third-party study on that, and I think that will also inform where we go in the spring.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. That's perfect. Thanks so much for the clarity there. And Calvin, big congrats on the results. I appreciate it.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Shar. It is good to hear you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Jefferies.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning, team. Thank you.\nI was hoping you could unpack the new Illinois legislation a little bit just in terms of what you see: the investment opportunities, energy efficiency, transmission for some of these distributed resources. If you could just kind of unpack that a little bit, it would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSure. Sure, Paul. I will start, and I will lean to my colleague Jeanne to help with that discussion as well. But as you know, on the last night of the fall veto session, Illinois passed what is called Senate Bill 25, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act. It really focused on two things, Paul, around state new customer programs as well as state policy and resource adequacy. It enhanced the energy efficiency program, which is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to improve resource adequacy, and it laid out a target of three gigawatts of storage by 2030.\nThat is significant. It also expanded the opportunities for consumers to leverage distributed generation rebate programs, and also advancing virtual power plant approaches and mandating time-of-use rate offerings, which, by the way, ComEd already offers some time-of-use rate offerings.\nSo this is in furtherance of that and telling people, \"If you're going to come into the market, we're going to evolve into that area.\" And finally, it also focuses on the broader role that the state can play in developing that integrated resource plan that I mentioned in my opening comments. So we think this gives the state further opportunity, and this is how they're looking at it, to demonstrate leadership in energy policy while also supporting economic development. Now, let me tell you, from ComEd's point of view, and Exelon's point of view, any opportunity we can to invest in the grid to keep that number one spot in reliability, resiliency, and to create jobs and economic development in the state, we're leaning in with them.\nI know our CEO, Gil Quiniones, at ComEd has been in discussions with not only the commission but the governor on what's next, but we're very actively engaged in that process.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOn Exelon, thank you very much. As we all start to think about Q4 and maybe a little bit of a sneak peek, I like that transmission slide where you show the large step-up in rate base in 2028, and obviously, that doesn't all hit earnings in 2028. As we think about 2029 and that roll forward, is it fair to think about just stronger growth year than 2020? You say it's below the midpoint of the range. Is it fair to think 2029 is stronger within the range?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. We'll get formal guidance on the Q4 call, Paul, but I think you're thinking about it right. We've got a lot of transmission opportunities to drive the solutions necessary as we see all this demand come in. We're very excited about transmission on the competitive side as well. You probably saw that we were active in the open window both with partners but also solutions just from an Exelon perspective. And we think we'll have clarity there by the end of the year on some of that, roll that into the Q4 update. None of that is contemplated in our guidance, nor is it in the $10 to 15 billion of transmission that we talk about outside the window. But what I would also say is a lot of those solutions, all of those solutions are 2030, 2032.\nSo the spend is sort of around the corner outside of the planning period. But what it does is it speaks to sort of the strength and the length of the continued growth in our rate base. We always aim to be at that 7% to 8% to drive the 5% to 7%, and I think this just positions us well to execute in the upper portion of that 7% to 8%.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Excellent. I'll thank you. I had to try in 2029. See you all soon.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAll right, Paul. I saw the effort. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Nick.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe just you kind of mentioned it in the prepared remarks around repairs and the CAMT, but just is this something that you think you kind of get clarity on by year-end and potentially consideration for the financing outlook as we kind of prepare for the disclosures out to 2029? Or just what's the kind of timeline there to get that clarification? Thank you.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, we're hopeful for the back half of the year. We know the IRS is working on additional sort of guidance for CAMT, and so hopefully we get that clarity by the end of the year. We do know some guidance was put out. The way it was written didn't achieve sort of the full intent, and so we're still working on that. But what I would say, though, is that, as we've talked about, that would be incremental cushion to the balance sheet and would be factored into the full update for our financing plan on Q4. But pleased to see progress there. Just want to hopefully close it out here in this year.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nI guess if you had the opportunity to use that cushion, is it less equity needs or accelerate CapEx further, just cognizant of the different pushes and pulls there?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. We want to stay on that path to 14%, as we mentioned. So this would be good momentum towards that 14% by the end of the planning period. And I think we've got equity in there. We've got hybrids. We've got additional capital coming in. So we'll put all that together and make sure that we deliver kind of the most efficient plan while we maintain that 14% or better, but also driving the 5% to 7% midpoint or better. So we'll factor that all in, but I would say that that's just helpful as we think about the cushion towards that 14%.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. And then just if I could, really quick, I know it's small, but just that the ACE rate case has been going on for a long time, and you're still saying that you're on track to settle this case. And maybe you can kind of talk a little bit about what's kind of informing the view that settlement's still on the table and why this wouldn't just go to a final order in the coming months here. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Nick. To your point, that case was filed in November 2024, and I need to give the Atlantic City Electric team and Tyler Anthony, the CEO of Pepco Holdings, a lot of credit because they've been working with the commission and all stakeholders, including our governor, and just making sure that we're being transparent, talking about each and every investment where it's needed and what the shared goals of the parties are. And that's why we're encouraged that we can get to settlement. But it is a process, and we do anticipate that that will happen by the end of the year. But at the same time, they do have the right to implement the interim rates subject to refund.\nSo I believe that keeps all of the discussions moving forward in the settlement on the table because under law, once you implement it, then it's subject. So they're saying, \"Let's get it right, right out the gate.\" And that's what they've been working on from day one. And I know we've been talking to both gubernatorial candidates on where we're going, what we're trying to do, and that partnership. So that's why we're encouraged.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks so much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Jeremy.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nJeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Just wanted to pivot a little bit here, if we could, towards the Amazon TSA. And it seems like there's been some developments there. Just wondering if you could provide us, I guess, your most updated thoughts on this part of the business.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. So what we've started to do for our large load is implement what we're calling a Transmission Services Agreement. And so the first one that we did was the one that you mentioned with the PECO data center in PECO's territory. We like this because it does a couple of things. One, it helps really kind of solidify projects, right, and kind of maybe weed out any speculative projects, but it also protects the rest of our customer base. So it's similar to what we've had historically on the distribution side where you have deposits, letters of credit, and other things that help protect the other customers should the demand that we build for not show up.\nAnd so we executed our first one there in the PECO territory, but we've now also filed in the ComEd service territory a large load tariff, which would ask that all large loads greater than 50MW sign these agreements. And so that, we think, helps do the two things that I mentioned, right, kind of really firm up the commitments but also protect other customers should the demand not rise. And I think what we also tried to do on slide 13 of the deck is to show you kind of how that pipeline of large load is kind of filtering into the high-probability column. You can see in the column of the 47GW of the ones that we're studying which ones are still being studied, which ones have already been studied, and are awaiting a TSA.\nOnce we get that TSA signed, we would move it into the high-probability. So that's a way to kind of keep track of how different load and different megawatts are moving from one category to the next.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thanks. And just wondering, I guess, any thoughts, I guess, on the $10 to 15 billion of transmission CapEx and thinking about probability weighting, all this and everything as you outline there. We've seen a number of your peers across the space lift their growth outlooks. And just wondering, I guess, what opportunities Exelon sees to stay kind of competitive with those types of growth rates?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think we are running our core business really, really well, right? Transmission and distribution operations, first quartile for all operations, delivering above-average performance with below-average rates. Continue to have met or actually exceeded all of the guidance, upgraded S&P. So I think the core business is running really, really well. And as we think about additional growth, that comes, to your point, in the form of transmission and energy security solutions. But you also know us at Exelon. We're not going to put anything in the plan that isn't certain and bankable. And so as we look for transmission, for example, I mentioned earlier, we do have some proposals in front of PJM in the current window. We'll know more about those proposals by the end of the year.\nOnce we have certainty on those, those will come in, and we'll put them in the plan so that you don't have to speculate or probability-weight some of them. That once they're in, you know that we feel very certain about them. But as I mentioned before, we're focused on delivering really in the high end of what we've committed to. As we see some of these opportunities materialize in the back end of our plan, then we can start to think about that. But let's focus on the execution first and getting them in. Of course, we'd always love to be talking to you about more, but we're going to focus on what's executable and build it in and put it into the plan once we know it's certain.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks so much. Good morning. Let's see. I had a quick question on that large load pipeline that you've laid out on slide 13. I was just wondering if you could just maybe characterize how you probability-weight that 47GW pipeline. I appreciate the extra detail you provided there. But in aggregate, are those still less likely to move forward? Or for some of those, is it just more of a matter of timing where eventually those could become more advanced stage projects?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nI think it's more a matter of timing. But what we're really trying to do is before we move it to that column, do two things. One, complete the cluster study. So all of the load is now studied in a cluster approach so that we can give more certainty to the customers on time and time to connect, and other associated questions, location, etc. We want to go through that first.\nAnd then from there, once we provide that information to customers, have them sign the TSA agreement. So that's kind of a two-step process, which once it goes through that, you and us and our states and our customers can have much more certainty around, this is highly probable, and it'll go into that 18-plus column. So that's how we're thinking about it. But I would tell you, it's all real. It continues to grow.\nIf you look at the chart, right, you've got six that have already been studied and just awaiting TSA signing. You've got 20 across the Mid-Atlantic and Illinois that is actively being studied, and then another 20 that is ready to be in the next cluster study. So we've seen this grow over the last couple of years that we've been talking about this from 6GW to 18 highly probable and 47 studied or awaiting to be studied. And so I think that speaks to there's a lot of certainty around this. But until we tell you until we go through those two steps, we don't count it highly probable. That's the process we're following now.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nDavid, I would just add, that is what's significant about that. You've probably heard the discussion around a lot of double counting that may be taking place across the country in the industry. Our process helps eliminate that and really focus on who's real and who's not.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, absolutely. That makes sense. Thanks for that color there. And I guess on that time to connect, I guess, what is the time to connect that you're seeing for new data center projects that are kind of getting into that 47GW, getting into the Cluster Study process? What is the maybe wait time or when are you able to offer power in your service territory for new data centers?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI'll start with that generally. It depends. It depends on size, location, the ramp-up period. But Mike Innocenzo and his CEOs have been involved in this process from day one, and I'll look to Mike to give any further clarity.\n\nMike Innocenzo\n\nCOO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I mean, I would just say that I would expand on the it depends. I would say the things that we do to try to shorten that. We understand the speed is really important. First thing we start with is where do we have capacity on the grid? So our first discussion with any data center would be, where's existing capacity? Where's existing infrastructure? You've seen that in, for example, the North Point one in PECO's territory, where we've used the site of a former facility. And they signed the TSA agreement just a couple of months ago. And by the spring, it'll be PECO's largest customer on their site. So where we can use existing infrastructure, existing capacity, we're doing everything we can to connect them.\nWe're working with our customers on the ramp-up time so that we can connect them quickly within a year or two or even less than that, as an example of North Point with existing facilities and ramp that up. And then working with PJM in terms of expediting the process for any of the long-term investments that are needed for updating the grid for some of the larger loads. And if I can, David, let me share with you. You've got the back end of what operations takes over. Over a year and a half ago, we centralized all of our large accounts, our data center accounts, to really work with the customers in the strategic planning process.\nJust last month, we had our 25 largest customers in Chicago and really started talking to them about what you need, where you're going, and what is your ramp-up time on certain things across our jurisdictions. So it's not just one state. We're working with them about what we have across our footprint, which once again elevates the size and scale of Exelon because we're in multiple jurisdictions and we can help meet that need. So we've started this process a long time ago, and we get up in the strategic planning process before we even start talking about shoveling ground.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWelcome. Thank you for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWell, first off, let me just say thank you. Thank you for taking the time today and for being part of our 25-year journey at Exelon. We appreciate your support, and we look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. We're looking forward to the discussion, and just the constant dialogue means a lot to us and I know for our employees to be engaged in. And so with that, Gigi, this concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Andrew, and thank you very much. And thank you all for being with us today as we report on our results through the first half of the year.\nWe continue to execute well across our priorities for 2025, building on a platform that is very well positioned to lead our states and jurisdictions through an exciting time in the sector. We earned $0.39 in operating earnings in the second quarter, above expectations at the time of our first quarter call, driven by favorable timing and cost management at our utilities, offsetting the impact of our $50 million customer relief fund, and a stormy start to the summer. This keeps us on track to deliver on our operating earnings guidance for 2025 of $2.64 to 2.74 per share. Now, storm seasons always highlight the talented and committed employees that make up the Exelon team. In June, PECO was hit with one of the largest storms in recent memory, with peak customer outages surpassing 325,000.\nRestoring power quickly was critical in light of a heat wave that followed the storm, and over 3,000 of our team members at PECO were joined by almost as many support personnel from around the country to bring customers back online, working tirelessly in 100-degree temperatures. It's easy to take performance like this for granted. This is what you've come to expect from Exelon and why we continue to be recognized as the one, three, five, and eighth most reliable utilities across the country. I'm incredibly proud of the sacrifices our team makes on a regular basis to provide the service our customers and communities expect. Turning to regulatory activity, I will remind you that our core rate case activity is limited this year, having updated investment recovery rates across close to 90% of our rate base in the last couple of years.\nHowever, we have remained very active across a variety of federal and state proceedings to solve an ever-evolving set of opportunities to better serve our customers and advance our state's energy and economic goals. Building on the momentum from Q1, our legislatures continue to consider ways in which they might address an energy landscape that is rapidly evolving. Illinois wrapped up its spring legislative session after drafting an energy omnibus legislation seeking opportunities to expand efficiency efforts, transmission build, storage, and resource planning, among other areas. While the legislature did not pass the bill, the process offered us and other stakeholders the opportunity to discuss critical issues, and we remain optimistic that Illinois will continue to lead the nation in advancing progressive, constructive legislation that enables effective partnership across private and public entities.\nOther states like Pennsylvania and New Jersey remain in active discussions around ways in which they might address tightening power markets, including bills to allow for utility ownership of generation. Coming off of last week's capacity auction, it's clearer now than ever that states should be thinking broadly about how to secure the energy futures for our citizens. Exclusive reliance on PJM-enabled low and relatively steady supply costs for its customers in a period of low demand growth, and when states weren't yet facing significant turnover in their generation supply driven by economics, policy, and technology. But the volatility and unpredictability we are seeing in supply costs, along with a steady increase in warnings from institutions like NERC and DOE, is undermining the faith in the status quo. Despite higher prices, we are not seeing the market respond fast enough.\nWe saw some new generation entry, but demand growth was double that amount. In fact, the capacity contribution by one of the quick solutions available, demand response, actually declined in this most recent auction. States have an opportunity to proactively bring control, certainty, and cost benefits by pursuing options outside of the capacity market, including regulated generation. Such options can ensure solutions are there to meet state goals when the market can't or won't deliver. State involvement already resulted in a savings for customers with the temporary cap on pricing, resulting in close to $3 billion saved relative to an uncapped outcome. But bigger, longer-term fixes are available with legislative action, and we stand ready to be part of that solution.\nWe look forward to continuing the dialogue with our states to be a part of the solutions to ensure energy is delivered reliably and cost-effectively in a manner that best suits their goals. Time remains of the essence in adding supply to the grid. As you can see, our pipeline for large load remains robust. Our large load pipeline is holding firm at more than 17GW and customers remain in our queue to study another 16GW of high-probability load that we expect to formalize as part of our pipeline by the end of the year. In fact, we have also opened another cluster study window at ComEd, closing in August, in which several gigawatts' worth of large load have indicated an interest in participating. And transmission solutions to connect this new load and generation to the grid are also advancing.\nWe continue to be well-positioned to be assigned over $1 billion of transmission work associated with the MISO Tranche 2.1 set of projects, and we now have the organizational structure and are developing strategic and financial partnerships necessary to take further advantage of our industry-leading position in transmission. The expansive work needed across all aspects of the grid gives us strong confidence in our four-year outlook and beyond, investing $38 billion through 2028 with an additional $10 to 15 billion of transmission work identified beyond that to support our jurisdictions and, most importantly, our customers. Success in winning competitively bid projects, which we have already proven we can do with the Tri-County line, would offer even more upside.\nBy earning a fair return on equity of 9% to 10% on a rate base growing at 7.4% through 2028 and financing that with a balanced capital strategy, we expect to grow our earnings at an annualized rate of 5% to 7%, with the expectation of delivering at the midpoint or better of that range. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to provide a more detailed update on our financial outlook and rate case activity. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our financial update for Q2 and the progress on our current regulatory activity. Starting on slide five, we present our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings block.\nExelon earned $0.39 per share in Q2 2025 compared to $0.47 per share in the same period in 2024, reflecting lower results of $0.08 per share over the same period. Earnings are lower in Q2 relative to the same period last year, primarily driven by $0.13 of higher distribution and transmission rates driven by new rates in effect. This favorability was offset by $0.07 of ComEd timing, which reverses most of the favorability seen in Q1 due to revenue shaping and timing of O&M spend relative to 2024. There's $0.04 at corporate attributable to our customer relief fund, $0.03 of higher storm costs at PECO, $0.02 of higher interest at corporate and PHI, and $0.02 attributable to the recognition of Pepco Maryland's first MIP reconciliations for rate years one and two in 2024.\nThe remaining $0.03 is attributable to smaller, non-recurring items, including timing of taxes at corporate and approximately $0.01 attributable to the derecognition of a regulatory asset subsequent to Maryland's Next Generation Act. As Calvin mentioned, these results are slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in our prior quarter call due to favorable revenue and tax timing at ComEd and disciplined cost management at our utilities. Our year-to-date performance underscores our ability to deliver strong financial results amidst increasingly significant storm activity and while continuing to find new and creative ways to support our customers.\nLooking ahead to next quarter, we expect earnings to be approximately 29% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range, which contemplates new rates in effect, anticipated shaping of costs and revenue timing, and assumes normal weather and storm conditions, along with our ability to seek deferral treatment of extraordinary storm costs at PECO from the first half of the year. As we look towards the end of the year, we remain on track for full-year operating earnings of $2.64 to 2.74 per share with the goal to be at midpoint or better. Finally, we reaffirm our annualized earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that range. Turning to slide six, I will review the limited base rate case activity across our platform.\nWe received intervenor testimony on 25 July on the Delmarva Power gas distribution rate case filed last September, keeping the rate case on track. The rate filing seeks to recover continued reliability investments such as aging piping along with the LNG plant upgrades, which help protect customers from price volatility during peak periods. Following intervenor testimony, the case will be open for rebuttal testimony in September before evidentiary hearings are held in November, in order as expected in Q1 2026. Our second open base rate case is at Atlantic City Electric, where settlement discussions remain ongoing as we seek recovery for grid improvement and modernization efforts in line with New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the Clean Energy Act, in order as expected by the end of the year. At ComEd, our first reconciliation under the new multi-year rate plan framework is underway.\nAs a reminder, we filed for a $268 million reconciliation adjustment, primarily driven by operating under a lower revenue requirement in 2024 than what was ultimately approved by the commission. The reconciliation is also inclusive of $6 million related to a positive 5.3 basis point adjustment to our return on equity from our performance metrics. In initial testimony filed on 15 July, staff recommended a $108 million reduction in the net reconciliation amount but noted they would consider additional information that could impact their ultimate recommendation. We continue to feel confident in the spend we incurred in 2024 as we maintained industry-leading levels of reliability at well below average rates and are working toward the remaining rounds of testimony, including our rebuttal testimony due next week.\nFinally, in Maryland, we continue to await decisions on our final reconciliations from the first BGE and Pepco Maryland's multi-year plans, along with the commission's comments on the lessons learned proceeding to support our next filings. We trust that we can find an approach that best aligns stakeholders' interests in balancing affordability, reliability, economic development, and the state's energy transition goals. Finally, I'll conclude with updates on our balance sheet activity on slide seven, where we've continued to make substantial progress on our 2025 capital needs. From a financing perspective, we have successfully completed nearly 80% of our planned long-term debt financing needs for the year, with ComEd and BGE issuing $725 million and $650 million in Q2, respectively.\nThe strong investor demand and attractive pricing we continue to achieve in our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform. Investor confidence in our offerings, along with our pre-issuance hedging program, positions us well as we seek to finance the energy transformation in the most cost-effective way for our customers and our investors. As it pertains to equity, we've successfully priced the full $700 million of planned equity needs for 2025 via our ATM, issuing $175 million in shares and pricing an additional $525 million under forward agreements for the issuance later in the year. In addition to de-risking 2025, we've also priced nearly $160 million of our equity needs for 2026 through forward agreements using our ATM, which we renewed in upside in the Q2 to cover our needs for the current four-year plan.\nWe continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of financial flexibility on average over the Moody's downgrade threshold of 12%, approaching 14% at the end of our guidance period, with a focus on ways in which we can protect and strengthen our balance sheet to ensure we support all opportunities to invest to meet our customer needs. Most recently, we filed with FERC for construction work in process incentive treatment on our Tri-County transmission project, which will support stronger credit ratings. We also continue to advocate for a language that incorporates repairs for calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax, which will lower energy costs for our customers. As a reminder, favorably addressing repairs in the minimum tax calculation would result in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan.\nAnd I'll also remind you that our financing plan and credit metrics are not impacted by the most recent tax legislation. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. Closing on slide nine, we remain focused in 2025 on our four core areas to create value for our customers, jurisdictions, and shareholders. As I noted, our employees deliver unparalleled service to our customers in all jurisdictions, which becomes especially apparent in the face of increasingly unpredictable and volatile weather. We invest every dollar as prudently and as efficiently as possible, trying to prevent outages from impacting our customers in the first place, even amidst storms. It's why 98% of the net profit earned at our utilities has been reinvested back in the system over the last five years. But storms inevitably bring disruptions.\nWhen that happens, our team works tirelessly to bring people back online as quickly as possible. Those two elements, our investments in the system and the performance by our employees, are the reason why we occupy four of the top eight spots in reliability in the industry. This focus on top-notch service at below-average cost is what drove ComEd's latest large load tariff proposals, which seek to ensure an interconnection process that is as efficient as possible for new customers while protecting existing customers against the risk that the load does not materialize at expected levels. We appreciate the engagement with large customers and other stakeholders in developing this set of proposals and look forward to finding a balanced solution as we continue to grow our pipeline of customers seeking to take advantage of industry-leading reliability at some of the lowest rates in the nation.\nThat customer orientation was also highlighted by the CEO of a quantum computing company, who noted ComEd's partnership with the state at the beginning of the company's site evaluation process was a key differentiator when deciding to locate in Chicago. Connecting this load continues to offer long-term advantages for our jurisdictions. The market for data processing, driven by artificial intelligence, increased reliance on the cloud, and other high-density load, is national, and ensuring our customers get the local benefits of that growth, including from a reduced share of fixed costs, supports longer-term affordability. But with the extent of investment needed in the grid, not just from new business but from connecting new generation to serve it, and from ensuring reliability and resiliency amidst more challenging weather conditions, affordability requires every tool we have and new ones as well.\nIt's why we continue to focus on connecting customers to federal, state, and local relief funds, including continued advocacy for key programs like LIHEAP. It's why we suspended disconnects, offered extended payment plans, and waived late payment fees after a cold winter. It's why we partnered with trusted local nonprofits to provide $50 million in customer relief for low and middle-income customers this summer. And it's why we're increasingly advocating that our jurisdictions be proactive in taking more control over their power supply, complementing the supply induced by the capacity market with solutions like utility-owned generation that their regulators oversee, giving them control, certainty, and cost benefits to customers that markets alone don't offer.\nBy putting our customers at the center of everything we do, we are confident we can earn a fair return on our investments and maintain a balanced funding strategy that enables delivering not only on 2025 guidance but also on our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We have built a platform and a culture of excellence over the last 25 years, and we are committed to using it to deliver consistent growth and long-term value for our communities and shareholders for the next 25 years and beyond. Gigi, we are now happy to take any questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star 11 on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Paul A. Zimbardo from Jefferies.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, Paul.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst of Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning, team.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nMorning.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst of Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thank you.\nI think just to kick it off, and you described it well on your call, and it seems like nearly every one of your governors, if not all of the governors, have been increasingly active with PJM. Which jurisdiction do you think is the most right for further action on that utility-owned generation or more energy efficiency, storage, something in those areas?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Thank you, Paul. This is Calvin, and I'll start off with you. I would say you're absolutely right. Our governor signed in and stepped in. As I talked about, we appreciate their engagement.\nWe are committed to working with PJM, but we do believe state involvement is critical in this effort, as I outlined. As I also said, Governor Shapiro's efforts specifically helped in capping what our customers would have otherwise had to pay, and that was roughly about $3 billion in savings. So that's significant.\nAnd all of our – and I shouldn't say all. Most of our jurisdictions have engaged in some legislative process to allow for us to look at what we can do to supplement existing supply. But as we talk about, you have battery storage at the T&D level being offered in Maryland. You have utility-owned generation considerations in Delaware. You're looking at it in New Jersey. And to your question, which is right, it depends on how quickly they are looking to move and where's the need coming from.\nBut what I can tell you, as we work with them and talk to them, we need three things that we talk about. One, certainty. Two, we want the states to think that they have a sense of control over this to the customer benefits that derive directly from utility-owned generation.\nWe're going to be part of the solution, and we're committed to it because it goes right to the affordability question. What can we do for our customers today that is not being done? But in the meantime, we do need to offer short, mid-, and long-term solutions in this process. I would look to Mike Innocenzo, our COO, to see if you have anything you'd like to add there.\n\nMike Innocenzo\n\nCOO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think the only thing I would add in terms of timing would be the Maryland legislation, which has a definitive request out there for 3,000MW of power. We'll know that by October, whether that's met by the competitive market. And I think if that's not met, that would probably be the next time in the timeline to trigger some additional action.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Mike. Paul, does that answer your question?\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst of Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nYes, it does.\nAnd just to follow up, and I appreciate that timing, Mike. Is it something that could be ready for a Q4 refresh when you do that next roll forward, just given the Maryland opportunities, Delaware, and New Jersey, just purely on the storage side? Is that something that could be ready in time for Q4, or could it take a little bit longer?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think it depends on the outcome of the procurement that Mike mentioned, but I think sometime next year we'll have more clarity for sure on all of our states.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAnd Paul, as you know how we do this, we're very deliberate about rolling forward on what we share with you. We're not going to speculate.\nWe're going to be consistent and transparent in everything we do, and promise you we'll bring that to you as soon as we have some clarity on where it's going.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst of Energy Research, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Yes. No, I appreciate that. Thank you, team.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nMorning, Anthony.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey. Hey. Good morning, team. Paul Z. took my PJM question. Just if I could look at the $10 to 15 billion of potential transmission opportunity, timing on when I could see that move into the base plan for the company. Is that on a fourth quarter refresh? If you give us some more timing of when that becomes part of your base plan.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Hey, Anthony. It's Jeanne. So you're right. We would normally do that in Q4.\nThe reason why is we have the cluster study that I mentioned, so we'll have more clarity on that in the fall. We have ComEd's grid plan that has to be filed in 2026, BGE looking at its next filing. We like to take all that together, including the transmission, and build that into the updated plan that we present to you on Q4. All of that will be contemplated in there, including the new business. I think if you look back in the last couple of updates, we've typically updated about 8% to 10% every four years, and I think transmission has gone up about 30%. You can expect that transmission will continue to be a big part of our roll forward going forward.\nThen, of course, we'll continue to keep an eye on the potential generation opportunities, working with our states.\nWe wouldn't build that in until it's certain. Then Calvin also mentioned that we've organized ourselves under our Head of Transmission, Carim Khouzami, to also look at other competitive types of transmission. So those opportunities are not in the 10 to 15, and we would only put that in, as you would expect from Exelon, until we have more certainty on those. But those are opportunities that we continue to work towards.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAnd financing that 10 to 15, a good rule of thumb, 30% to 40% equity? Or I'm curious, what would be a good rule of thumb to finance that incremental CapEx?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYes. We have been using a rule of thumb of every new dollar is about 40% equity.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. And then if I could jump to Wired, I don't know what paper it was, had a big story on, I think, the Illinois governor and quantum computing.\nAnd it seems like, I apologize if I mispronounce the name, Governor Pritzker is very big in quantum computing. Is that creating a bigger opportunity or a unique opportunity for ComEd that maybe it's different than the data center thematic that's going through the rest of the country?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGreat question. And you did pronounce his name correctly, so congratulations. I was there last week on a panel with members of IBM and others talking about the quantum computing campus that they've established. And the state of Illinois is very proud of that. And you heard me allude to in my comment, [inaudible], that the CEO of PsiQuantum said that but for ComEd engaging in that process, it wouldn't have come to Illinois. That's very significant, and it goes into that partnership.\nSo to your direct question, is there upside? Absolutely.\nWe've already seen requests coming from others who want to be on that campus, and that was the whole point. You get an anchor, and people want to be close to what they're doing and benefit from the quantum computing efforts. And it was a several-day conference on exactly that. And once again, this is not built into anything that we've provided you because we're going to be very transparent on the when and the who. And when we roll it forward, it will come for you. But that's separate and above anything that we've talked about.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, hey. Good morning. Thanks so much.\nMaybe on, let's see, on the generation side of things, we've obviously seen some of your peers express a willingness to build regulated-like or contracted generation. So, wondering your current thoughts on whether that might kind of fit into your model. Is that something you would consider?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSimple yes. And it's based on how it's done. Policy matters in this process, right? And we go back to those three tenets. We need certainty. We want to make sure we have a clear understanding where the states are getting in control.\nAnd we also want to know what the customer benefits. But we want to be part of the solution, and we do believe in that portfolio approach because what you're finding right now, David, is that the cost, the supply is not meeting the demand. So what can we do to be part of that solution?\nBut how it's done does matter. And we're very optimistic that our states will do something. I think it was Paul that asked earlier where our states are engaging in this discussion. And we're engaged in those discussions every step along the way. And we want to partner, and we will continue to partner with PJM. But we do see it as an and, the competitive markets and regulated generation being part of the solution.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And we think the regulated generation in partnership with our states is the best way to do it. So again, the states need certainty, right? While the PJM works the competitive markets, if the states don't want to wait, right, and they know they have economic development that needs more generation, this regulated path can give them certainty. It also gives them control.\nThey can decide what type of generation makes sense for their customer set, for their state. And in working with them, we can provide that control. And then it provides customer benefits. We know we have a cost of capital advantage, and in doing it and proactively planning, you can get, we believe there's customer benefits there. So that's why we believe that's the right way to do it. And look, half of PJM states today already have sort of a hybrid approach between some sort of regulated-like generation and the restructured market.\nSo this isn't new or novel, and we think our states should just capture the opportunity, get that control, the certainty, and the customer benefits, and we stand ready to partner with them and move forward.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.\nThen I was wondering if you could elaborate on how data center discussions have been progressing recently. How quickly do you anticipate firming up more megawatts and kind of any reactions that you're seeing from the industry to some of the large load tariffs that you're rolling out?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWe talked about. We see significant activity in Illinois, and we talked about the second cluster study that's being presented and started in August, which will provide more clarity as we go forward. Then let me just be very clear. We're also seeing data center activity across our other jurisdictions: Pennsylvania, Maryland. So this is not just a one state. You just see Illinois being in the top five of what we're doing.\nSo understand it's driving forward, and you'll see more of those announcements coming in. But doing it the right way with reliability in mind is key.\nI'm looking at Mike. I'm going to ask Mike if he'd like to jump in there.\n\nMike Innocenzo\n\nCOO, Exelon\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add is timing is, Calvin, as you mentioned, so we've got active cluster studies going in Illinois. We've got active cluster studies going in the Mid-Atlantic. We expect results in Q3, Q4. Once you complete the cluster studies, you have commercial discussions with the different applicants there. So I think you would start to see in Q3 and Q4 some announcements as a result of those cluster studies coming out.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And we are watching the other large load tariffs across the states.\nYou may have seen ComEd filed with the ICC some proposed changes to its tariff, just seeking to not only meet the moment here with our new customers and get more clarity and certainty there, but also protect the other customer base. So just memorializing this use of cluster studies, recognizing state-certified economic development priority projects. And this would all be for projects 50MW or more. So it's pretty consistent with what you're seeing in other states, but that would be the most recent that we filed. And the ICC is going to seek, I think, opinions and stakeholders on that as well.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Good morning. Hey, Calvin. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the large load pipeline.\nIs there any color you can provide in terms of the potential timelines for projects to progress through the different phases that you've outlined in that pipeline, and what the potential gating factors potentially impacting that cadence would be?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nHey, Carly. It's Jeanne. I think once we, what I would say first, kind of to answer your second part of your question, I think what we try to give you is something that is highly confident. So when it's in these phases, I think we have found that it's sort of met the initial studies, and we feel more confident to move forward. Don't expect necessarily barriers. But what we have outlined is, as we think about those megawatts, we think about 10% of that load will be online by 2028, another 1/3 by 2030, and then 3/4 of it by 2034.\nSo not only do we want to give you kind of where they are in the phases, but then also you can kind of think about how they move through those phases in correlation with the load ramp that I mentioned there.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay. That's super helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the PJM capacity auction results and customer bills. Could you just talk a little bit about the bill impact with these auction results in place, especially with the BGE clearing being lower relative to the last auctions? And then any shifts that you're anticipating in sort of the rhetoric around customer bills from here?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. So Carly, I think what you saw. I'll address with BGE specifically. What you saw is BGE finished the previous auction higher.\nSo the relative delta between this one and that one, that's why you saw less of an increase this time than you did last. But we anticipate the BGE bill impacts, and I'm looking at Tamla Olivier, the CEO of BGE, of roughly $1.50 going into our BGE customers. And again, I always say this: a $1 increase on some of our customers' monthly bills is a dollar too much. So we take it very seriously. So you see across our jurisdictions, we see anywhere from $1.50 to 4 increase going across the system. And we're doing everything we can to offset that and work with the states to mitigate it, but that's the impact we're seeing.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah.\nI think in terms of your comment around sentiment, I think there is a broader understanding and recognition that this is driven by the supply costs, right? We need the investments necessary in the grid to attract the economic development, just like we need to address these rising supply costs. That goes back to what we're doing in terms of working with our states, having them take control, thinking of complementary solutions to PJM. Now, that may take some time in terms of generation. Back to what Calvin said, whether it's energy efficiency or demand response, those are the near-term solutions we really need to take action while we get these longer-term solutions in place.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAnd Carly, it also goes directly to why the commissions need to be directly engaged, the commissions and the governors, because these other solutions, we can do some things today to offset some of the rising costs and customer bills. But it has to be very thoughtful. It's no longer, \"Can you do one-offs and expect something to happen?\" It has to be that portfolio approach. And energy efficiency and demand response are clear examples of what some of our states can do today to decrease customer bills. But because it's out of their norm, you get hesitation.\nAnd we continue to work with them to think broader than just today or the next decision.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for all the details. Super helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you very much, Gigi.\nAs always, thank you guys for joining. Let me just say that we are committed to work with our states to really drive financial excellence and operational excellence. We appreciate your support, and we hope to see many of you in the months ahead as we continue to get out on our roadshows, talk with you, and look forward to seeing you at our financial conference at EEI. With that, Gigi, that concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information, can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on slide two of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures.\nReconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our Q1 Earnings Call. 2025 is off to a good start. We're reporting operating earnings of $0.92 per share, representing strong growth over Q1 2024 and ahead of expectations, which keeps us on track to deliver on our 2025 operating earnings guidance range. Reliability and safety performance continues to be very strong as well, despite a number of high wind events throughout the winter months that challenged our operators who remain the best in the business. ComEd and Pepco Holdings are projecting top decile audit frequency and duration performance, while BGE and PECO are in top quartile. We have a relatively lower level of base rate case activity this year, and our two open rate cases remain on track at Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Power, which Jeanne will cover in her remarks.\nWe have also been actively engaging in a variety of legislative and regulatory reforms to ensure energy policy keeps pace with the industry and broader economic trends. Ensuring reliable and affordable energy for all customers is critical to our jurisdictions and the nation as a whole as they work to realize their economic and energy policy ambitions. Q1 2025 has already seen great progress on that front. In Maryland, the legislature passed several energy bills that take important steps around energy security, including prescribing a competitive process to procure new dispatchable resources and capacity while providing a path for alternative approaches should they be needed. They also lay out ambitious goals around developing battery storage at both the distribution and transmission level, offering us and developers further opportunity to shore up the state's energy supply.\nThe state also outlined, for the first time in law, the recognition of multi-year plan constructs, prompting a robust discussion that highlighted its merits of increased transparency, planning, and alignment while giving stakeholders a greater say in how much and where their dollars should be invested. We now look to the Commission to conclude its multi-year plan lessons learned process so we can move the state forward with confidence in meeting its energy and economic goals. Our other states are also considering legislation to address elements of energy policy, including a focus on the energy security and cost allocation implications of large load growth. We expect to have more to share on those sessions as the year advances. There has been significant activity at the regional and federal level as well. First, PJM has made considerable progress to address sub optimal outcomes in its capacity market construct.\nWe have been pleased to see that FERC approved a number of solutions put forward by PJM via 205 filings, including its temporary price collar and refinements to its deactivation process. We are also encouraged to see the response to its reliability response initiative, which has generated applications worth almost 27GW of nameplate capacity. In February, FERC initiated a 206 proceeding requesting that PJM and its transmission owners investigate whether the tariff remains just and reasonable in rates, terms, and conditions of service that apply to co-located arrangements. We are pleased with the leadership shown by FERC in working to resolve this issue in a timely manner, along with PJM's efforts to meet the aggressive timeline to address a very complicated topic.\nWe're also encouraged by the consensus that PJM transmission owners were able to reach on a complex topic in such a short period, and we look forward to assisting the industry in aligning on a policy that equitably supports the national crisis critical issues of energy security and economic development. More details on the progress we're making across these forums can be found in our appendix. Maintaining momentum across these policy arenas is key to meeting the task ahead of us, and we see no abatement in our opportunity for new large loads in our territories. The 17GW pipeline of opportunity that we communicated in our Q4 earnings call remains fully intact. We are also conducting advanced studies on an additional 16GW of high-density load, which we anticipate will result in significant incremental commitments from customers upon aligning on investment needs and timing.\nWe continue to focus on ways to enhance our process to ensure we are offering unparalleled service to our new customers in our territories while continuing to ensure existing customers are protected and benefit from the new load. And the pace of new business seeking to connect to the grid makes it even more critical for stakeholders to collaborate actively and with urgency on policy that balances the common goals of reliability, affordability, and progress toward a cleaner energy future. We look forward to providing further updates on our new business prospects in future quarters. As a reminder, this is just one of the elements that contributes to our visibility into $10 to 15 billion of transmission opportunity beyond our plan. As we laid out in our Q4 call, the need for investment in our high voltage network is real and growing.\nWe are proud to have Carim Khouzami now leading those efforts with his extensive background in commercial, regulatory, and operational roles ideally suited to industry tailwinds and our unique transmission assets and capabilities. I also want to congratulate Tamla Olivier for her promotion to BGE President and CEO. Her effectiveness leading increasingly large organizations during her 15-year career here will continue to ensure BGE's 2 million electric and gas customers receive high-value service. Congratulations to you both. Lastly, I'll remind you of our expectations for our four-year outlook. We reaffirm our plan to invest 38 billion over the next four years for the benefit of our customers that will drive 7.4% rate-based growth and be financed with a balanced mix of debt and equity.\nIn fact, we have been able to de-risk a large portion of our financing needs for the year with all of our planned corporate debt issuances completed and 60% of our $700 million annualized equity need priced. By earning a fair return on that investment plan, we expect to deliver annualized annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2028, generating consistent growth and long-term value. I'll now turn it to Jeanne to discuss our financial performance and provide further details on our rate case activity.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our Q1 financial update and progress on our 2025 regulatory activity. Starting on slide five, we present our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings walk. Exelon earned $0.92 per share in the Q1 of 2025 compared to $0.68 per share in the same period in 2024, reflecting higher results of $0.24 per share over the same period. Earnings are higher in the Q1 relative to the same period last year, primarily driven by $0.14 of new distribution and transmission rates in effect across our jurisdictions, $0.03 of favorable weather at PECO, and $0.02 of tax repairs timing partially offset by $0.03 of higher interest expense due to higher levels of debt at increased interest rates.\nAs anticipated, results are also impacted by timing at ComEd, which totaled $0.09 for the quarter and includes $0.02 due to the lower revenue recognition in 2024 as we awaited updated rates from the rehearing order and eventual approval of our refiled grid plan. The remaining $0.07 is due to year-over-year revenue shaping and O&M timing, including higher storm and IT project-related spend in the Q1 of 2024. We expect the revenue shaping and O&M timing to reverse in the balance of the year. These results are slightly ahead of our indications on the Q4 call, primarily due to this timing of O&M as well as timing of tax repairs.\nAs we look ahead, our Q2 earnings are expected to be approximately 14% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range, which contemplates partial reversal of the ComEd timing along with normal weather and storm activity. In combination with Q1 results, this would result in recognizing 48% of projected full-year earnings in the first half of the year, consistent with seasonal shaping in prior years, allowing us to remain on track for full-year operating earnings of $264 to 274 per share with the goal to be at the midpoint or better. Finally, we are reaffirming our annualized earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that range. Turning to slide six, we currently have two base rate cases open at Pepco Holdings.\nThe Delmarva Power gas distribution rate case filed last September remains on track with interim rates which went into effect on 20 April, subject to refund. The rate case seeks to recover continued reliability investments such as aging piping upgrades and upgrades to its LNG plant, which helps protect customers from supply price volatility during peak periods. It will be open for intervenor and rebuttal testimony in July and September before evidentiary hearings are convened in November. An order is expected in Q1 2026. Our second open base rate case is at Atlantic City Electric, where we are seeking recovery of grid improvement and modernization efforts in line with New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the Clean Energy Act. The proposed procedural schedule was approved by the judge in March, with settlement discussions set for late April to early May.\nEvidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late July and continue into early August, with an order expected by the end of the year. ACE is also anticipated to implement interim rates on 21 August, subject to refund. In Maryland, we continue to work to close out our final reconciliations from the first BGE, and Pepco Maryland multi-year plans and remain engaged in the lessons learned process as we approach our next rate case filings. We are encouraged that the legislature recognize the multi-year construct in the recently passed Next Generation Act. This legislation provides greater direction and alignment between all stakeholders on the future investments needed to support our customers.\nNow that we are on our second MIP at BGE and our fourth one in Maryland, we feel better prepared to support a multi-year investment plan without a reconciliation, and we look forward to working with the Commission and our stakeholders to continue to demonstrate customer benefits in future multi-year plan filings. We steadfastly believe that forward-looking plans are the most planful and cost-effective way to ensure the reliability and resiliency of the system while meeting the state's energy and economic goals. We await the Commission's comments on the lessons learned to fully ensure our next filing aligns with the PSD's recommendations that accommodate the new legislation and the lessons learned proceeding. Finally, in Illinois, ComEd filed its annual performance evaluation and request for annual adjustment under 2024 base distribution rates on 29 April 2024.\nThe requested adjustment of $268 million is primarily driven by operating under lower revenue requirements throughout 2024 relative to the final approved order, and it includes the revenue impact of achieving a performance metrics adder of over five basis points. ComEd's actual revenue requirement in 2024 closely aligns with the final revenue requirement approved in December 2024. Direct and rebuttal testimony is expected to occur throughout the summer at a hearing, and an ALJ proposed order in the fall. A final order on ComEd's reconciliation is expected in December. Turning to slide seven, I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. From a financing perspective, we took advantage of the favorable market conditions in Q1 and made substantial progress on our 2025 capital needs.\nFirst, we have completed nearly 50% of our planned long-term debt financing transactions, having successfully raised $650 million for the Pepco Holdings utilities and all of our $2 billion of debt financing needs at corporate, including $1 billion of hybrid debt. The strong investor demand and attractive pricing for our debt securities continue to be a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition, positioning us well as we seek to finance the energy transformation in the most cost-effective way for our customers and our investors. We also continue to execute on our pre-issuance hedging strategy implemented in 2022 to further protect us from interest rate volatility.\nAs it pertains to equity, as a reminder, in our last guidance update, we estimated we would finance 40% of our incremental capital investment with equity, resulting in total equity needs of $2.8 billion over the four-year plan and implying approximately $700 million of equity on an annual basis. For 2025, we've successfully de-risked nearly 60% of our annualized needs via our ATM, issuing approximately $175 million worth of shares and pricing an additional $250 million under forward agreements for issuance later in the year. As you heard on our last earnings call, we project to continue to have 100 to 200 basis points of financial flexibility on average over the plan for our consolidated corporate metrics above the Moody's downgrade threshold of 12%, approaching 14% at the end of our guidance period.\nWe continue to advocate for language that incorporates repairs for calculating the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and we are encouraged by the recent bipartisan legislation introduced in the US House to advocate for this change, which will lower energy costs for our customers. However, we will remind you that our plan assumes that the final regulations will not allow for repairs. Favorably addressing repairs in the minimum tax calculation would result in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. In closing on slide eight, I'll reconfirm our focus as we look to add another year of execution to our track record as a premier utility. Our talented and dedicated employees will continue to deliver operational excellence, investing $9.1 billion in the system to deliver high-reliability service to our customers. We are also constantly working to find the right rate-making mechanisms that allow us to fulfill our responsibility and privilege to serve the 10.7 million customers that count on us for their energy needs. Those mechanisms need to provide adequate compensation for our investors while allowing for the critical feedback and collaboration necessary to ensure we are only investing where our jurisdictions want us to invest. We recognize some of our customers are broadly struggling with economic uncertainty, as well as we all navigate updated tariff policies, federal budget reprioritization, and increased energy supply costs.\nWeather extremes like our first cold winter in years only exacerbate those pressures. We do feel that we are relatively well-positioned to protect our customers as it pertains to the proposed tariff policy. With approximately 90% of our supplies sourced domestically, we have estimated the impact to be around 1.5% of our four-year capital and O&M investment plan before any mitigating efforts, with the majority impacting capital. The impacts would also be delayed as a result of our inventory levels and long lead time requirements. With our size, scale, deconcentrated investment plan, and the culture of cost discipline, we expect to be able to manage any tariff-related impacts, highlighting the value of Exelon's platform. And while we are advocating for the continuance of the tax credits under the IRA law, we are not directly exposed to any reductions in those, nor to any transferability restrictions.\nAs Jeanne mentioned, we remain committed that we will be able to improve our position with respect to the corporate alternative minimum tax associated with that law. We will continue to leverage a variety of tools to assist customers, including deferred payment plans as well as suspended disconnections and associated fees, and we are advertising budget-billing options throughout community forums and community engagement events. Additionally, our policy advocacy has focused on solutions that enable PJM and our states to acquire new power supply as cost-effectively as possible while serving large new loads equitably. As I noted earlier, we have made good progress thus far in legislative and regulatory forums. Finally, we also stress the degree to which we try and maximize the dollars that we need to invest in the grid to serve our customers.\nWe focus on forward-looking recovery mechanisms because it allows us to collaboratively determine where best to invest their dollar and do it efficiently. In fact, over the last five years, over 98% of the net profits we earn at our utilities, all of which are established and reviewed through rigorous regulatory proceedings, we have been reinvested back into the business for our customers. For every $1 million of capital investment we make at our utilities, it supports eight jobs or $1.6 million in economic output. Customer affordability continues to be a big part of our focus this year, which complements our efforts to drive economic development to further benefit our jurisdictions.\nOf course, as always, you can count on our continued discipline in executing our financial plan, earning a consolidated ROE of 9% to 10%, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and reporting earnings within our guidance range of $2.64 to 2.74 per share. We look forward to making 2025 our 25th anniversary at Exelon, another year where you can count on us to deliver consistent growth and long-term value. Latif, we can now open it up for any questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, simply press star one one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead, Nick.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Nick.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nHey, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's well. So I guess just you have this new Maryland legislation that's out there. It does prohibit reconciliations after 1 January 2025. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe kind of talk about how you think that can impact the outcomes in the BGE or the Pepco reconciliations. And if an order were to kind of go against you there, is the guidance resilient to that? And maybe you can kind of give some more color on that. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, Nick, let me just say this first. Thank you for the question. To your direct point, I think Jeanne hit it well, is that we do expect the reconciliation to come forward in short order. Our plan is solidified and ready to operate as we've considered all alternatives. There's nothing on here that we believe that would prevent us from meeting our objectives. That's one. But let me turn it also, Nick, to where we see Maryland going. As you know better than most, that Maryland this year had a legislation passed. I think it's important to focus on five key areas I'll point out. One, for the first time, it provides language that MYP can be approved. As you talked about, it doesn't have reconciliations. But we've kind of gone through this process a couple of times now.\nI think Jeanne said we're in our fourth one in Maryland. So we know how to build this up and know how to work collaboratively with the stakeholders to ensure we spend on the right base. I'm very comfortable that we will meet the budget for future MYPs. Second, specific language in the legislation this year stated on the large load co-location issue, which was very important. It has provisions in there that requires that any load that for infrastructure upgrades, and other reasonable costs behind the meter. It's balanced, and it does not shift the cost to other customers on the system. That's very important. That would apply to any load over 100MW with 80% or greater capacity factor. So that's just very important.\nAnd it's important to note that we continue to drive this on an affordability front within our jurisdictions, and Maryland has codified it. The next piece is that battery storage was a big item within the Maryland legislation. It directed that the Public Service Commission establish and solicit 150MW of distribution battery storage from each electric utility with a target of 70% owned by the utility and 30% owned by third parties. It also required that the PSC start a procurement solicitation of 1.6GW of transmission battery storage by January 26. Again, all indications that they recognize the issues and they're driving the state of Maryland forward. And I just want to also give kudos and just acknowledge the two new commissioners that have been appointed.\nThey have a strong track record of regulatory experience, and I think they will continue to be vital voices in Maryland as we move forward. So, long answer, but to your direct question, we are not concerned about the reconciliation pull-out of the legislation, and we feel very confident that we will work with the state to meet the needs going forward.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for all that color. I appreciate that. And then maybe on the FERC 206, obviously, there's been some requests to settle by the power companies, and that was put forward a week or two ago. And I'm just curious what your response would be as a T&D. Do you think, or are you open to resolving this co-location issue via settlement, perhaps? Or does this kind of need to go the full distance at FERC? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nOh, thank you, Nick. I would say we're always open to discussions and have been from the very beginning, and that hasn't changed. We continue to move forward as a T&D to meet our customers' expectations. We talk about the 17GW and another 16GW that we're considering. So our process is continuing. I think the transmission owners coming together and putting forth this statement, EEI putting a transmission owner unified statement to FERC, goes a long way. So our principles have not changed one bit, Nick. And we are right there. And in having discussions with the IPPs, we're open. And we're open to make sure that we get this done quickly and equitably for all of our customers, and that has not changed.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWelcome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Kennedy of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open, James.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHello, James.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. So one of your peers has been talking recently about the introduction of legislation in Pennsylvania to support potentially regulated generation. I guess, what's your degree of involvement in that process and any views on regulated generation versus potential long-term PPAs and other mechanisms? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI would tell you that anything that is good for our customers to address the issue of resource adequacy and affordability, we will support. As you can appreciate, James, our teams are actively involved in those discussions at the legislative front and even having the discussions at the regulatory side. So we just need it to be balanced, and we need to ensure that the recovery of us getting into that, I will quote my CFO, is that we need to have a very straightforward approach and that recoverability is very clear and outlined in legislation. So we know what we're getting into, and we're partnering with the state to meet those needs. But it's all about the customers in terms of affordability, energy security, and adequacy.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then just on the data center side, thanks for the incremental color in the appendix slides on the phases. Is there a rule of thumb that we should be thinking about for how you convert between the phases and ultimately shift into the capital plans? Just any kind of timeline considerations. Thanks.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Hey, yeah, we don't really have a rule of thumb because every project is different. We always start with how do we be most cost-efficient for all of our customers? So, as you can imagine, therefore it depends. But what I will say is that the $38 billion that we have in the plan, $5 billion of that is for new business. When I look back to our last four-year plan, that was an increase of $900 million. We can expect to continue to see more incremental capital necessary to accommodate the new load. As we outlined in our Q4 call, that $10 to 15 billion beyond the planning period, at least $1 billion is related to this new business. As we know, the investment is needed. We build it into the plan.\nBut as we also know, we don't put anything in that isn't certain. So, of the $38 billion, $5 billion related to new business, and that's at least a $900 million increase from our last four-year period. And we expect that to continue.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nExcellent. Thanks, guys. See you soon.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nJulien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Nice to be done, guys. Hey, thank you. You got me excited. Absolutely. Just following up on some of the last questions, if I can press a little bit further, if you don't mind. First, on the data center front, I mean, you all are framing these as 80% and 50% probable. These are fairly high numbers in isolation. How do you think about the timing here and how that perhaps is juxtaposed against the backdrop of this FERC ongoing process? Again, I think we all take it for granted that maybe one sort of precludes the other. But how do you think about it? 80% probability is non-trivial, particularly given the metric that you define them as having already achieved.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I would say, well, I would start with saying that none of this, as a reminder, is dependent on that co-located FERC 206. This is all front of the meter, full T&D, typical sort of customers that we have in our service territory. So none of that is dependent on that process. And in fact, we're not seeing any slowdown as we work through that process. So we announced the 16GBs on Q4 2024. Those 16GBs remain very solid, high probability. And we've even given more color in terms of phase one, phase two, and phase three for those 16Bgs. What we did a little bit different this time is also give you insight into what's around the corner. And we have another 16GBs. So sorry to confuse you, but they're both the same number. But it's another 16GBs.\n12 of that is a cluster study, the second cluster study we're doing in ComEd service territory. Then four of it is just spread across the East Coast utility. So continued momentum, all in front of the meter, not dependent on this process. But as you heard from Calvin, we continue to work that process in parallel because we want to meet any and all types of customers. As we think about the buckets, you can see again phase one, phase two, phase three. I would say 70% is probably phase one, another 20% phase two, and 10% in phase three. We feel very confident in the other 16GB. And I think you can kind of think of them roughly in the phase one time period too.\nBut we wanted to be clear about how we're thinking about those and the fact that we're moving more, because of the demand we're seeing, more of a cluster study approach where we're looking at customers together so that we can give them better insights into time, cost, and things like that. So continuing to evolve our customer service there. But as that cluster study is completed, as we work the other 4BGs, you can expect us to kind of move that 16GBs into the other phases as we continue to update you on a quarterly basis.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. Excellent. Thank you for clarifying that it remains distinct and separate. I appreciate that. And then related, just not to nitpick too much on the prepared comments, but just curious, when you talk about assisting the industry with respect to the backdrop here on leadership at FERC, how do you think about what that timeline looks like and what that settlement process could be? I know that there's several different forms, right? You could have another PJM stakeholder process. There could be more of a FERC-oriented process here. How do you think about potentially finding a joint arrangement or settlement here amongst a litany of different parties?\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Julien. It's Colette Honorable. How are you today?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary, Exelon\n\nJulien, can you hear me? Okay, good. Let me get to your question. One, let's take a look at the docket itself. We really see quite a bit of consensus in the docket. Calvin referenced the filing by EEI, which represents a majority of the industry, the NERC filing, the filing from the independent market monitor, and then the United Transmission Owner Group really demonstrate to FERC that there is a record and a consensus about how to treat this load. When Calvin said, \"We appreciate the commission's effort here,\" it is to move quickly so that we can all have the clarity that we need. That's where we started in this matter. And so we're not surprised at all by how the docket is progressing. As Calvin mentioned, we will be open to having discussions of any sort.\nWhat we really want is for FERC to issue a decision quickly so that we can all have the clarity, so that we can support the large load that Jeanne described, as well as, going back to Calvin's point, ensuring affordability and energy security for all of our customers.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. So looking for FERC to take action principally before anything else with a firm decision.\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary, Exelon\n\nWe think there is a record before them to do so. As Calvin mentioned, should the commission determine that settlement discussions are appropriate, we would be more than willing to participate in that exercise as we have been very constructive partners in the past. If you look back at our record here, we were the ones that really started in the forefront of this issue. So we've demonstrated that we will be constructive and collaborative partners, but we're ready to continue supporting this moment in time.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Thank you all very much. See you soon. Cheers.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Julien. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, David.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Maybe a quick follow-up on the data center side of things. Could you give a sense as to the timing of when that load looks to be ramping up within your forecast period? And I guess from your. I'm also thinking in the context of your infrastructure and any limitations there. When can you connect in new large loads at this point, given such a big pipeline?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. So as we think about the 16GBs that we have on the slide, we think about 10% of the load will be on by 2028, another 1/3 of it by 2030, and then 3/4 of it by 2034, and then the remainder beyond that. So that kind of gives you an insight into the view as we see the load coming on. And then your second question, again, it depends on the customer. I mean, I think there's at times where it's 36 months. We're always trying to push to be faster for our customers. Other times, it can be a little bit longer. But in all of our discussions, the most important thing we hear from our customers is just understanding the timeline and being upfront with that, which is why these studies are so important. So I think.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nLet me add there, Jeanne. David, also, I think it was last year we talked about how we restructured our customer strategy organization. We created a centralized group to talk with the data center developers and really to understand what their needs were. By strategically working with them ahead of time, what we found is that we can meet their needs and understanding how much they need to ramp up in a timely fashion and also determine appropriate sites where they can connect quicker onto the system where the infrastructure was already there or in large part there so it required less. That's the partnership. Give you an example. Just about a month ago, we had an EEI-hosted, and we hosted with them a large key account meeting in Chicago.\nWe had sidebars with all the large data center developers to talk about their needs and where they were going. We looked at all of our six jurisdictions to say, \"If this is what you need, here are sites that we've identified,\" and that's that partnership. So to Jeanne's point, all very different, but it's a very collaborative approach in how we're targeting it.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Excellent. Thanks for that. I wanted to touch on affordability. We've seen some states maybe louder than others, but seeing the impact of PJM capacity, pricing increases, and increased focus in affordability. Wondering how you're kind of approaching that, getting ahead of that, and managing affordability challenges and concerns broadly across your portfolio?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nNo, you nailed it. It has become the primary topic of discussion this past winter. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, this was the first cold winter we've had in several years. And as an example, BGE bills were up approximately 50%, with 80% of that increase due to weather, commodities, and just legislative changes that were made. Our Delmarva Power & Light (DPL) had no real changes in gas distribution rates, but equally high increases. We continue to see weather volatility and supply costs, which are the primary challenges we are working to address and mitigate for customers. And as I talked about, what we're doing proactively. We're helping our customers manage the cost. We're talking about energy efficiency. We're going out to customers' homes and small business, really driving what they can take action on to mitigate some of those.\nWe're deploying our tools to assist customers. We've already suspended disconnections. We've delayed or extended payment plans, removed any additional charges. And I think the biggest piece for us is that we're out in our communities at a robust level, holding community forums, connecting with them, and ensuring that the assistance that may be available at the state and local level, we're connecting them with that. So that is the key. Are we done? Absolutely not. Do we recognize the hardship that many of our customers are facing? Yes. As I always say to my team here, a dollar increase for some of our customers is a dollar too much. So we're not taking it lightly. And so we're having conversations at the state and local level about how to partner.\nI think a good scenario that you can think about, the Maryland legislation that I was talking to Nick about earlier, they allocated $200 million from a fund that they had established. I think that fund was called a - it was Strategic Energy Infrastructure Fund directed at companies. It had about $300 million in. They took $200 million of those dollars to help people with paying their bills. Now, how can we partner with them to let those dollars go further? We're having those discussions. So you're right, key issue, the key issue, and we're meeting those challenges.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you so much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli of UBS. Please go ahead, Bill.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, Bill.\n\nBill Appacelli\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North America Power & Utilities Research, UBS\n\nHello. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to go back to Maryland for a second. Maybe on the lessons learned docket, can you just remind us on the timeline and maybe what's the range of outcomes there? Given the legislative development, is there any concern around not continuing the MYPs beyond the current plan? Or what sort of is maybe a range of scenarios that we could look to there?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI would tell you that the fact in the debate this year around MYPs, the state legislature did a wonderful job at understanding the value of MYPs. But we do have the discretion, to your point, on whether we do—we do believe that that multi-year collaborative process, the engagement with stakeholders, forward-looking, is the most productive. So I don't see anything to date that would take us away from that. And I am pleased that the commission did embark on the lessons learned process. So it extended into this year, likely delaying the timing. But we believe that this legislative session that we just had will spark a ruling very soon. As you may recall, we went through an extensive process to determine that it was the best option. And so I think we will have a. I'm looking at Carim and Tamla here.\nWe will have a decision in short order. We anticipated by the end of Q2 that we will have a decision on the lessons learned. We continue to involve in this debate. Everyone has submitted their comments. Everyone has engaged in the process from the Office of People's Counsel to the large industrials to residential customers. So everyone's voice has been heard, which is what we wanted. That's what we were driving to.\n\nBill Appacelli\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North America Power & Utilities Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Great. Then just going back a little bit to the resource adequacy debate, you're indicating an ever-increasing amount of load that's interested in coming on. The queue, I think, for new capacity additions remains pretty small, right? I think there's only about 6GW of gas in the queue for PJM. I guess FERC is going to be having this technical conference here in June. But I guess where do you guys stand in terms of addressing the resource adequacy concerns as you look out to the amount of load that wants to come on over the next, call it, five to seven years?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWe do believe it's a portfolio approach, meaning that there is an approach that PJM and all of our states can take that we can't limit how we get the generation resources to the table. We should be looking at everything. And if it's a delay of closings of certain plants, if it's allowing gas to come in and build, and we talked about this, utilities owning generation, all of that needs to be on the table because, as you've just said, we're at a critical time in this industry where we have to meet the need. Having said that, it has to be a very balanced approach. And you have to balance it with the affordability issue. And I think that's why it's all coming to the table right now. So our discussion is portfolio approach.\nLet's be open to it and get it done sooner rather than later, and also put the right policies around it where you don't shift the cost from one customer group to another because we're running too fast.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And I think to add to that portfolio approach, just a focus on energy efficiency, distributed resources, demand response, and engaging with our states there to say, \"How can those programs, whether we have them today and we expand upon them, or can we implement new programs to continue to add to that portfolio approach?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAnd part of our challenge, and we've been saying this for a while now, is some jurisdictions are using, let's call it, outdated rules: outdated rules to address modern issues. We need to keep the policies updated to address the needs of tomorrow. That's what we're working on. I'll just be honest, it takes some time to move regulatory bodies forward in a timely manner to meet the needs of tomorrow. That's what we've really been putting our attention towards.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nI think one of the slides we talked about is to Calvin's point about the portfolio approach, right? We're active at FERC, active at PJM, pleased to see PJM putting forth proposals on the capacity auction. FERC already approving some of them. But then also, to Calvin's point, working with our states. Maryland has already made progress here in the first legislative session with outlining a competitive procurement process for 3GW of in-state generation. So I think we're pleased to see all of our stakeholders working with a sense of urgency. And we're right there at the table to help drive those solutions.\n\nBill Appacelli\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North America Power & Utilities Research, UBS\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you for that.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler for closing remarks. Sir?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you. Thank you, Latif. Let me just say to everyone, thank you for your interest and support of Exelon. I hope as we continue to move these things forward, we're providing you with valuable information. We appreciate you all taking the time to join us today and for your support. Latif, that concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the Appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our Q4 earnings call, closing out another successful year for Exelon. We're entering our 25th year as a company since the historic merger of Commonwealth Edison and Philadelphia Electric Company in 2000. Fly eagles fly. The industry and the company have seen a tremendous amount of change during that time, not unlike the years over the century plus that shaped ComEd and PECO since their origins in 1881. But some threads indelibly run through that history, including, most importantly, a commitment to excellence in service to our customers.\nThat commitment inspired Samuel Insull in Chicago, whose vision made electricity more accessible to all customers, and it continues to inspire us today. Which shows in the results we're reporting and where our focus will be in the years ahead. It was another year of excellent operating performance. All four of Exelon's utilities achieved top quartile for reliability, with three of our utilities ranking in the top five among our peer benchmark, and all four utilities performing in the top eight. It was also another year of excellent financial performance. We reported GAAP earnings for 2024 of $2.45 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 per share.\nMaking it our third straight year as a pure T&D company of meeting the midpoint or better of guidance. In fact, when you look back at the earnings path we laid out when announcing our separation in our Q4 2021 earnings call, the midpoint of our 2024 guidance was $2.50. When you think of all the change Exelon has managed during that time separating the company, generationally high inflation and interest rates, and transitioning to the new ComEd rate structure, it is remarkable to think that we maintained our trajectory. That is who we are, a company that our customers, employees, policymakers, and investors count on to deliver.\nOn the regulatory front, we successfully closed out a very busy year for rate cases. As we'll discuss further, this puts us on very strong footing to serve our customers and focus on expanding ways to support the energy transformation in the years ahead. These include ensuring our jurisdictions can continue to participate in the exciting growth of artificial intelligence powered by data centers that can foster economic development. As Jeanne will discuss, there are other significant potential transmission opportunities as well. Such as the MISO Tranche 2.1 work that are not currently in our guidance.\nBut which will require an additional $10 to 15 billion of investment to serve our customers in the coming 5 to 10 years. Those opportunities illustrate why our updated four-year plan continues to reflect the steady investment growth that you should expect from a company that serves more customers than any other in the US in some of the most critical regions for the economy. We now expect to invest $38 billion from 2025 to 2028 to support customer needs. No single project will be more than 3% of that plan, and of that $3.5 billion in capital growth, more than 80% is attributable to transmission.\nThis type of investment ensures that our utilities remain a key engine of our jurisdiction's economies. Not only do our investments create good local jobs, an estimated 70,000-plus, and not only do they ensure the spending stays local with more than $4 billion of our supplier spend sourced from our jurisdictions. Most importantly, it ensures reliability, which, when the economy increasingly counts on access to reliable, and resilient power, can really multiply the power of our impact. The growth in our high-density load pipeline by over 2.5x in the last year is evidence of that.\nComEd alone won 15 major projects, bringing in an estimated $17 billion of projected capital investments from other companies and creating over 1,000 jobs in Northern Illinois. With this development comes increased load, and we're seeing 1% to 2% load growth over our four-year period, allowing us to distribute the cost of the grid over more usage. To fund these investments in a disciplined manner, we are maintaining a balanced funding strategy, financing the growth with 40% equity and building on a solid trajectory to sustaining and improving our credit metrics over the plan.\nThis commitment to balance sheet strength is evidenced by an upgrade to Exelon's credit rating by S&P last week. With continued returns on equity in the 9 to 10% range, we expect annualized earnings growth of 5 to 7% through 2028, with the expectation of being at the midpoint or better of that range. For 2025, we're initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to 2.74 per share, and we are increasing our dividend to $1.60 per share, keeping our payout ratio in line with the 60% we have communicated as part of our capital allocation policy. The top line results make it clear 2024 was a successful year.\nAnd slide 5 more extensively highlights all of the ways in which our execution set us up for continued service to our customers, communities, and stakeholders, checking all of the boxes that we laid out this time last year. For instance, we invested $7.5 billion of capital, executing within 1% of our guidance, even with substantial reductions at ComEd as we worked to gain approval of our refiled grid plan. We earned a 9.1% return on equity despite a large portion of our rate base awaiting updated rate recovery, and significant storm and weather headwinds. We executed on our financing plan and continued to see strong investment-grade credit ratings at our agencies.\nCarrying that into the S&P upgrade this year. As you'll hear more from Jeanne, our organization remained laser-focused on cost, having identified dozens of initiatives that support $100 million of sustainable savings and many more that we continue to pursue with our dedicated team. It's a key contributor to our year-over-year growth in O&M of just 0.5%. But beyond managing our costs, affordability remains a top priority into 2025, and our customers anchor our focus as we engage with policymakers. I will return to this topic in my closing remarks. I am so proud of all that our 20,000 employees were able to accomplish this year.\nAnd I thank them for their commitment no matter the circumstances. And that starts with job one of safely keeping the lights on and the gas flowing, which I'll cover on the next slide. As I mentioned, it was another top decile year for ComEd and Pepco Holdings from an outage frequency and outage duration perspective, and BGE and PECO also attained top quartile. This was no small feat, and particularly at ComEd, which faced an unprecedented set of storms in July that produced 43 tornadoes, more than that region sees in an entire year, while also receiving the ReliabilityOne Award for Outstanding Performance in the Midwest.\nOn the Gas side, our hardworking employees at BGE, PECO, and Pepco Holdings also delivered top decile performance across the board for the entirety of 2024, the fourth year in a row that all three have achieved top decile. This sustained operational excellence is where our investments translate to real customer value. Importantly, our employees achieved these results with a strong focus on safety, ending the year with top quartile performance on serious injury incident rate. Now, any safety incident is one too many, so we continue to build out our observational tools and procedures to improve.\nLastly, our customer satisfaction scores remain consistent with the levels seen throughout the tQ3, with ComEd and PECO in the first quartile, and BGE and Pepco Holdings in the second quartile. With the onset of our first colder-than-normal winter in a number of years and higher energy supply costs, we recognize that affordability remains a critical aspect of the customer experience. To further improve performance at BGE and Pepco Holdings.\nThey are expanding efforts to enhance customer support in partnership with our communities. BGE and Pepco Holdings are waiving late payment fees in the winter months and suspending non-payment disconnections in February, including extending the length of payment arrangements where needed. We are also continuing to focus on empowering our customers to access digital tools and strategies to conserve energy during high-usage months. Now, we took similar actions during the pandemic. Our customers can count on us to proactively take measures when needed to balance affordability while ensuring a safe, reliable, and resilient grid.\nWhich is critical to our communities and our economy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with our stakeholders to expand our solution set for customers. I'll now turn the call to Jeanne to recap our 2024 financial performance and provide details on our updated long-term plan. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. You know, I want to shout out our PECO employees and all Eagle plants as well, and I'll just say go birds. But with that being said, today I'll cover our Q4 and full-year results, key regulatory developments, and updates to our financial disclosures, including 2025 guidance. Starting on slide 7, as Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the third year in a row, earning $2.45 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.50 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our guidance range and result in 6% growth off the midpoint of our guidance range for 2023.\nFor the quarter, Exelon earned $0.64 per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Full-year earnings benefited from ComEd's rehearing order we received in April. We also managed costs across the platform well as we offset another year of mild winter weather and higher storm activity while ensuring we could accommodate a range of outcomes with significant regulatory activity in Q4. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year can be found on Appendix Slides 35 and 36. Turning to our outlook for 2025 on slide 8, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to 2.74 per share.\nWith new rates in effect across nearly all of our jurisdictions, furthering continued investment for our customers, 2025 earnings growth relative to the midpoint of our 2024 estimated guidance range is in line with previous disclosures. As we look ahead to Q1, we expect a relative EPS contribution to full-year earnings to be higher than historical patterns at approximately 33% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range. This accounts for the cold start to the year, new rates in effect, anticipated shaping of costs, and ComEd revenue timing, and assumes normal weather and storm conditions for the balance of the quarter.\nTurning to slide 9, as Calvin mentioned, we successfully closed out a busy regulatory calendar in 2024, reaching final resolution on key rate cases that provide supportive cost recovery for the next several years. Starting with Pepco, on November 26, the DC Public Service Commission issued a final order on Pepco's Climate Ready Pathway DC multi-year plan, providing for $123.4 million incremental revenue requirement and a 9.5% ROE through 2026, advancing the shared interest in supporting the district's energy goals.\nAs part of the order, the Commission initiated a lessons learned process to evaluate the learnings from DC's experience with multi-year plans thus far and to formalize the adoption of regulations for alternative forms of rate making. We are looking forward to participating in the process in which a final work group report for the first phase is due by the end of 2025. Moving on to PECO, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the joint petitions for settlement in PECO's Electric and Gas rate cases on 12 December. The approved settlements allow for a $354 million Electric revenue requirement increase.\nExcluding a one-time credit of $64 million in 2025 and a $78 million Gas revenue requirement increase in 2025, providing the funding necessary to further enhance reliability, enable cleaner energy options, and improve the level of service customers have come to expect. Last, on December 19, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved ComEd's refiled grid plan and rate plan adjustments, providing recovery for a level of investment that will allow us to serve customers safely and reliably while making progress on the goals of CEJA. Relative to 2023 rates in effect, the final order provides for an approximate revenue requirement increase of $1 billion from 2024 through 2027.\nInclusive of the increases that were approved in the December 2023 order. As a reminder, the construct allows for the recovery of prudently incurred investment and expenses of up to 105% of the approved revenue requirement, with certain investment categories such as storms, and new business recoverable independent of the 105% threshold. With these final orders, close to 90% of our rate base has established rate mechanisms in place through 2026 or 2027, allowing us to focus on plan execution and the strategic engagement necessary to support growing electrification needs and promote expansion of reliable generation in our states.\nThere are currently two Pepco Holdings base rate cases open. Delmarva Power filed its gas distribution base rate case in Q3. Seeking to recover continued reliability investments, including pipeline integrity management, aging pipe upgrades, and upgrades to its LNG plant. With the expectation of implementing interim rates on 20 April, subject to refund. Atlantic City Electric also filed its base distribution rate case on 21 November. Seeking recovery for grid improvement and modernization work supporting New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the Clean Energy Act. ACE has requested an increase of $108.9 million, with the expectation of implementing interim rates on August 21, subject to refund.\nFinally, in Maryland, we continue to work to close out open reconciliations from our first BGE and Pepco Maryland multi-year plans. And we remain engaged in the lessons learned process for multi-year plans as we approach our next rate case filings in Maryland. For our final briefs in December, we continue to advocate for multi-year plans as the appropriate rate structure to direct the increasing investment needed to support a reliable 21st-century grid while offering specific options to address stakeholder feedback on ways to improve upon the first set of multi-year plans. Moving to slide 10, we provide our updated utility CapEx and rate-based outlook through 2028.\nWe plan to spend approximately $9.1 billion in 2025 and a total of $38 billion over the next four years, an increase of $3.5 billion from the prior four-year planning period, which reflects greater investments to support our jurisdictions and updates to align with recently approved rate cases and jurisdictional priorities. Of the overall increase, over 80% is attributable to incremental transmission capital. Such investment is driven by the structural trends that underpin the energy transformation in our jurisdictions, increased demand for high-voltage investments to support high-density load growth, and expanding and modernizing generation supply stack.\nAnd the reliability and resiliency needs of grid customers. Over $1 billion of that transmission increase is projected at ComEd, where we see continued commitments from data centers and other high-density load customers, and interest continues to grow in our other jurisdictions as well. Serving this new business will also require additional investment in the distribution network. The balance of the additional transmission relates to continued capacity expansion across our platform, including an additional year of investment in our two largest transmission projects. One supporting the retirement of the Brandon Shores Coal Plant and the other, the Tri-County Line.\nTo address reliability needs due to load growth in the region. As a reminder, the Brandon Shores project is expected to go into service in 2028, while the Tri-County will go into service at various points in 2029 and 2030. As we continue to allocate relatively more spend to longer-dated transmission projects, our annualized rate-based growth of 7.4% over the next four years remains fairly consistent plan over plan, with a projected addition of nearly $20 billion from 2024 to 2028. As the next slide shows, we feel confident about our ability to continue making the necessary investments to ensure our regions can meet their economic and energy goals.\nWhich rely more than ever on a safe, secure, and resilient grid. As you'll see on slide 11, Exelon has an unmatched platform to meet the clear need for transmission investment. The proliferation of high-density load, increasingly volatile weather, and a growing and changing generation stack all point to it. We serve more customers than anyone else, and we are one of the largest investors in transmission among our peers. With award-winning reliability, our utilities are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the transmission opportunities beyond our existing 11,000-plus miles today. Beyond the $12.6 billion transmission capital in our plan.\nWe estimate $10 to 15 billion of transmission opportunity within our footprint in the next 5 to 10 years. This includes over $1 billion of additional investment to support new high-density load, which is in our pipeline but not yet in our guidance due to its earlier stages of design and planning or estimated online dates. This upside also includes investments to address themes between PJM and other regions, such as the work associated with MISO Tranche 2.1, which we are optimistic will result in at least $1 billion of spend in our ComEd service territory through PJM's supplemental planning process.\nOur involvement in those projects also creates opportunity to be a part of the competitive processes for the $6 billion of work MISO estimates it will bid out, and we continue to see more of a need than ever for new generation, particularly to ensure our states can meet their policy goals. Transmission interconnections are needed to deliver that power to customers, no matter where it's situated or how it's generated. In fact, achieving CEJA's goals amid growing economic development in Illinois will likely require significant transmission investment.\nAll of this work complements the continued need for reliability and resilience investment in our existing infrastructure to modernize aging lines, ensure better security, and harden critical infrastructure. In 2019, PJM found that 2/3 of the transmission system in its footprint were over 40 years old, with 1/3 exceeding 50 years, and some lower-voltage transmission assets nearing 90 years. It is clear that there is no shortage of need to invest to serve our customers and communities well beyond our four-year plan. With some of the best-run utilities in the country, we are well-positioned to execute these opportunities while prioritizing reliability, resiliency, and affordability.\nMoving to slide 12, our dedication to operational excellence encompasses a commitment to customer affordability, ensuring we deliver above-average value at below-average rates. Our ability to deploy $38 billion of capital for the benefit of our customers over the next four years is only possible with a rigorous focus on cost management and delivering value for those investments. This focus is saving our customers approximately $550 million in O&M annually relative to what it would have been growing at a standard inflation level over the last decade.\nAnd we feel confident we can continue to keep our expense growth similarly limited over a planning horizon with an institutionalized team and culture committed to delivering value,. Even when our jurisdictions look to expand ways in which we can support them. As we have mentioned, we have taken advantage of our exclusive focus on energy delivery to standardize and streamline our organizational structure and operations. Through 2024, this has resulted in approximately $100 million in executed sustainable savings initiatives, with line of sight to many more opportunities to ensure we can keep raising the bar for the value we provide our customers.\nOperating as one Exelon has helped to identify unique and impactful opportunities, like our cross-company project to identify best practices among our frontline distribution employees. This discipline further enhances the value of our investments, which have improved reliability by 35% since 2016. Achieving some of the best reliability metrics in the industry while also maintaining bill metrics that are 19% to 21% below US averages makes it clear we are delivering above-average performance at below-average rates. Turning to slide 13, with $38 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.4% rate-based growth.\nAlong with earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are projecting compounded annual earnings growth of 5% to 7% from our 2024 guidance midpoint of $2.45 per share. Maintaining our commitment to transparency, we have provided assumptions associated with our expected annual growth and earnings through 2028 on Appendix Slide 18. As you can see on the slide, after 2024, we expect to deliver each year within the 5% to 7% range, keeping us on track to deliver at midpoint or better of our 5% to 7% annualized growth rate from 2025 to 2028. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout of operating earnings.\nWith the dividend now projected to grow in the lower end of our long-term earnings target as we retain more of our capital to invest more efficiently for our customers. For 2025, we anticipate paying out a dividend of $1.60 per share, representing 5.2% growth over last year. Finally, I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet and financing expectations on slide 14. Maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be core to our strategy, and we closed out another year with average credit metrics comfortably exceeding our downgrade thresholds of 12% at Moody's and S&P. We are pleased to receive an upgrade from S&P last week.\nWhich takes Exelon's corporate credit rating up to BBB+ from BBB. We have updated our slides to reflect this improvement. Along with a revised downgrade threshold of 13% at S&P that is reflective of the higher credit rating. With most investment plans and recovery mechanisms established over the next two to three years and our balanced funding strategy in place. We anticipate our metrics approaching 14% by the end of our forecast. Demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nAs a reminder, we continue to advocate for language that incorporates repairs for calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax in the final Treasury regulations. Though our plan incorporates the assumption that the final regulations will not allow for repairs. If implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan. From a financing perspective, we expect the $38 billion capital plan to be supported by $20 billion of internally generated cash flow, $12 billion of debt at the utilities, and $3 billion of debt at the holding company.\nWith the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. Specifically, we expect 40% of our incremental capital will be funded with equity. Bringing our total equity needs to $2.8 billion over the four-year plan, implying approximately $700 million of equity per year. Our financial plan has also been designed to accommodate the use of other fixed income securities that receive equity credit in place of senior debt at our holding company. In addition to other credit-supported internal levers.\nThese instruments provide a more efficient means of building additional financial flexibility while ensuring we deliver at the midpoint or better of our 5 to 7% annualized earnings growth rate range through 2028. I want to close by reiterating our confidence not only in the plan we have laid out.But in the broader opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders, not just now, but in the decades to come. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. I'll review our focus areas in 2025 before stepping back and reminding you what makes Exelon unique. As a key partner in our jurisdictions, as an employer, and as an investment. As I mentioned when I started the call, this business has always been about our customers. It was when Rembrandt Peale lit the first gas lamp in the streets of Baltimore in 1816, ultimately incorporating what became BGE, our nation's first gas company. It was when Exelon was formed 25 years ago, creating the foundation for the network of wires and pipes that now delivers energy to more than 10.7 million customers today.\nYou can expect us to continue to focus on an equitable and balanced energy transition. For the first time in decades, we have an opportunity to serve a growing load base, for which we have already seen our jurisdictions compete successfully. The magnitude of load growth we're seeing requires us to think differently about our approach to energy supply. Over a period of limited load growth, competitive markets have been able to save customers billions of dollars annually while delivering adequate supply. However, it's clear as we face rapid and significant load growth, we need enhanced solutions at PJM.\nAnd we also need other approaches complementary to PJM that can meet those evolving customer needs as cost-effectively as possible. We have been actively working with stakeholders on solutions to the higher energy supply prices that they face, and slide 21 in the appendix outlines our positions and priorities as we work this actively with policymakers at the federal, RTO, and state levels. Indeed, we are consulting with stakeholders on no less than 45 bills across our jurisdictions that impact supply or demand-side solutions in some way. Regardless, it's clear that states are and should be proactively involved in supply solutions that complement the markets.\nNot to mention pursuing policies that enable more demand-side solutions. There is no single answer to meeting the levels of load growth that are anticipated, but instead, a variety of solutions across regulated and merchant participants is necessary. We're committed to working collaboratively to support policies that ensure energy security as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. In the meantime, we remain highly focused on all of the other ways in which we support customer affordability, areas in which we have and will continue to excel. This includes continued vigilance on cost, with our size, scale, and culture keeping cost growth well below inflation.\nIt includes Energy Star award-winning efficiency programs, which saved customers an estimated $18 per month in 2024. Third, our robust efforts to connect distributed resources, allowing customers an opportunity to generate their own power and save money from 4.2GW of generation. And finally, our innovative tools and processes to connect customers to low-income energy assistance, which totaled $500 million in 2024. These efforts only increased the value of our product, which we're delivering at top quartile or better levels, and which we can only achieve with an employee base that can count on us to engage them, develop them, and send them home safely.\nIn doing all of this right, we will execute on our financial plan, deploying $9.1 billion this year to support our customers that will earn a consolidated 9% to 10% operating return on equity from fair rate case outcomes that aligns with our stakeholders on how we invest customer dollars, dollars which flow right back into their communities to drive increased economic opportunity. We expect to deliver on our operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to 2.74 per share, as always, with the goal of being at the midpoint and better. And lastly, we will execute on the financing plan that we laid out.\nAllowing us to maintain a strong balance sheet and support the grid our customers expect and deserve. These priorities are aligned with the pillars of our value proposition on slide 16, which we use as our North Stars to ensure that the entire Exelon organization is working together to create value for customers, employees, and shareholders. You can see we already lead the industry in so many ways across these areas, whether it's the number of customers served, the award-winning and innovative services we provide them, or the consistent top quartile reliability, or the innumerable recognitions we receive as an employer of choice.\nWe are a company that does what it says, consistently delivering against our financial commitments in a manner that reflects strong alignment between our customers, policymakers, and shareholders on the value created by our investments. With these investments delivering 5% to 7% annualized growth and a dividend yield of around 4%, we offer an extremely attractive risk-adjusted return of 9% to 11%, which translates to consistent growth, long-term value. Michelle, we can now open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone keypad. And our first question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nDurgesh, good morning.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nGood morning. Good morning. Good morning, Calvin. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, listen, so just I had a couple of questions. First, just in Maryland, a little bit more color there. So what are you expecting out of the reconciliation decision? How is that going to impact your future rate case filings and then implications to your financial plan? We're getting a lot of questions around that, so maybe just a little bit more color as to how you're thinking about Maryland.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, absolutely, Durgesh. Let me first take it, and then I'll also offer it up to Mike or Jeanne if they have any color to add. Let me be very clear that we believe the process is moving forward at a decent pace. What's been very evident is that we've shared with the commission and all stakeholders that we do believe that the costs that were incurred were prudent. We have provided evidence and supporting that effort. And if you even look at what others have come forward and saying, I don't think there's anyone questioning those costs of what's been incurred. Now we're just moving forward in the process and the evidence being done and letting it play out.\nBut it has been a very collaborative process to date. Mike, anything to add there? No, I would just say that we firmly believe that we've offered a structure that gives predictability to customers, helps us lower costs for customers, and gives a good solid financial return for our shareholders as well.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, and I'll just add, Durgesh, on the reconciliation, the procedural schedule takes us probably the first half of this year. So in Q1 or Q2, we expect an outcome there. As Calvin mentioned, all prudent, reasonable costs. When we had first initial rounds of testimony, the proposals from staff and others were aligned with prior reconciliations. Much of that reconciliation was actual structural issues, things that we saw in the first two reconciliations. Continue to move that forward. Then on the lessons learned, I think just reiterating what Mike and Calvin said. But also the multi-year plans that we highlighted from our perspective.\nIs that multi-year plans have provided strong alignment with state policy and alignment of what we're investing while also keeping our distribution rates in the first quartile. It's been a good mechanism in terms of delivering, but also keeping the distribution rates competitive. Multi-year plans are not unique to Maryland. Two-thirds of jurisdictions use them or some similar type of sharing mechanism. We like the three-year timeframe, but are flexible on that. I think there's a lot to be said about historic test years, honestly creating more work and being less effective on the cost control. That's the piece that I think is so important right now.\nIf you think about affordability, if you think about delivering value for the customers, when you have a forward-looking plan, the ability to lock in long-term contracts, the ability to align your workforce, the ability to plan ahead is what allows a company like Exelon to deliver that O&M growth rate of 2% to 2.5% in a period of rising inflation. We think these types of mechanisms provide a lot of benefits, which is what we continue to highlight in that lessons learned. We also expect the lessons learned to be completed in the first half of this year, and then we would kind of have that clarity moving forward for our next rate filings.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nThat's very helpful. We'll look for those data points in the first half. Thank you. Then just switching gears, a lot of focus also on the 205 with FERC. Maybe just update us what your latest thoughts are. Are there any discussions with stakeholders and what to expect as 24 February 2024, the date, is soon approaching?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAbsolutely. I have Colette Honorable, who's our Chief Legal Officer, here with us. Colette, if you would like to lean into that.\n\nColette Honorable\n\nChief Legal Officer, Exelon\n\nThank you. And thank you for the question. As you may be aware, we are still awaiting a decision. And to your point, we continue to talk with a number of stakeholders, including PJM, to find forward-looking solutions that work well for our customers and for investors. We are awaiting a decision in the 205 docket, and we hope to get a good result. We have been a leader on these issues, and bringing issues around resource adequacy and energy security to the forefront. We appreciate the leadership from our states, from our governors. We appreciate the way that PJM has been leaning in with a number of proposals and reforms.\nAnd if I might mention for your edification, we received word from FERC of two approvals of reform efforts, one relating to shovel-ready projects. That's in docket 25712, really making sure that projects that are shovel-ready are moving to the forefront. We were very supportive of that reform. And then in 25778, the surplus interconnection service docket, which really helps to ensure that it's easier to add more generation to existing sites for generators, that one was approved as well. So we are seeing FERC being helpful here. We're going to continue to lean in and lead.\nAnd we're hopeful about a positive result in the 205s and are also at the same time continuing to work to engage with stakeholders. These customers are presenting us, as you heard from Calvin and Jeanne, with unprecedented load growth needs, and that creates unprecedented opportunity. So we'll continue to work with all involved in a way that meets the needs of our customers, focuses on energy security and affordability, while protecting the interests of investors.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. Thank you. That was very comprehensive. [crosstalk] Yep. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThank you. Good morning. Hope everyone's doing well. So hey, just one quick clarification. Slide 18, just when we think about the growth into 2027, is that just year-over-year off prior year 2026 midpoint? Is that the way to think about that? Do you have a comment on that?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYep. Yeah. That's the way to think about it, Nick. We try to give you kind of the year-over-year. We always go back to the midpoint of guidance. So if you're thinking about this slide in totality, right, this is really about how do you grow, how does Exelon grow from 2024 midpoint of $2.45 through 2028 on a year-by-year basis such that we get to that midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% over that four-year period.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThank you very much. And then I know legislation has been kind of a priority in Maryland from stakeholders, and I was wondering if you can kind of comment on what you would kind of expect there. But also just what's your expectations in Pennsylvania as it relates to solving for a generation and rate-based solution or some type of other capacity arrangement with the state that could alleviate the congestions there? Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, no problem, Nick. I will start off, and then I have with me Carim Khouzami, who's the CEO of BGE, and of course, we have David Velazquez with us as well, who's the CEO of PECO that can add on. But let me just share with you, as I said in my opening statement, we have over 45 bills that we're actively working across all of our jurisdictions, all with the focus on ensuring affordability, energy security, and adequate generation. I mean, that's resource adequacy in those lines is first and foremost. Having said that, several pieces of legislation proposes changes to regulatory and planning processes.\nIncluding implementing distribution planning, expedited review of certain clean energy generation, and creating a new integrated resource planning office. And by our footprint, we're looking at best practices that are being suggested in one jurisdiction and how do we employ that or share that information with our other jurisdictions. So I'm going to stop there and let Carim talk about what's happening in Maryland, where I think there's over 20 bills to date that you're tracking.\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nEVP of Transmission and Development, Exelon\n\nThere is, Calvin, and thank you, and good morning, everyone. I would just echo what Calvin said. Right now in Annapolis here in Maryland, there's a lot of attention being made on how do we deal with the resource adequacy issue, energy security issue here in Maryland. As a reminder, Maryland currently imports about 40% of its power from out of state. That is something that the legislation, the governor, and many others are very focused on trying to see what we can do to incent generation to be built in the state. The approach that's being taken is more of an all-of-the-above approach.\nThey're looking at various different fuel types, various different ways to incent, and to try to get generation built here in the next few years so that we can increase the amount of in-state capacity. As BGE and Pepco Holdings, we're very involved in all those discussions. We're very supportive. We agree with the state that we need to build more in-state generation to relieve some of the pressures that we have on the supply side of the bill. So again, that's something that we're looking at, tracking closely, and working closely with all stakeholders.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAnd Nick, you also asked about Pennsylvania, and I know there's two active bills currently addressing the resource adequacy issue. And David Velazquez, you want to share your thoughts?\n\nDavid Velazquez\n\nCEO of Peco, Exelon\n\nYes, this is Dave. Good morning, everybody. PA, like other states like Maryland, has been very active. You've seen that the PUC has held technical conferences on this issue. As you know, Governor Shapiro has been very active in working with PJM to address this issue. And all the companies in Pennsylvania as well have been active in trying to work with all the stakeholders to come up with, I'll say, alternatives if necessary to the PJM capacity markets to ensure that we continue to have adequate generation. And some of the things that have been mentioned do include longer-term contracts.\nThey include utility build. Some of those things will require legislation, and I think it'll be an active session legislatively around those issues as well as both in the House and Senate. Lawmakers are concerned about some of the same issues.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nGot it. Okay. Some more to come there. Really appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nNo problem, Nick. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys so much. Appreciate the opportunity.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, appreciate it. Go birds there.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nJust coming back, a couple of different things here real quickly. Absolutely. Hey, just with respect to the, I know Durgesh was trying to get at this a second ago about prospects, but just to say it explicitly, how do you think about settlement abilities here? I mean, I know there's a few different dockets, a few different efforts afoot with respect to PJM policy and co-location. Is there an ability to settle that out and kind of sidestep maybe a more protracted effort considering that there's all this discussion about the kind of power? And then related, I'll throw it in at the same time tied to data centers.\nHow are you thinking about these deposits here in as much as that seems like a wider industry trend and certainly is an offset to rate-based growth and certainly could accelerate through the course of this year? So is there any kind of heuristic you'd offer as you continue to see some development, some data centers, and how much that could sort of prove a netting effect to near your rate base, if you will?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Julien. Let me make sure I capture the essence of the two-part question. One was talking about settlements as it relates to activity that may be going on at the FERC level and so forth. And the second was really focusing in on deposits that customers are giving around data center growth and if that can spur additional development and growth moving forward. On the first piece, let me just share, and then I'm going to turn this to Jeanne, is that we always are looking out for the best interests of our customers and having active discussions with all parties involved.\nWe are never going to believe that we always are sitting back and can't come to some type of resolution and keep moving it forward. But we have some tenets that we're holding on to because it's around affordability for our customers, and that the grid is being shared by everyone, so everyone should bear some of those costs. So having said that, I'm going to turn it to Jeanne to give you any additional insight.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think on the first one, Julien, I would just, the word settlement is used, but I think of it more as like, do we partner with stakeholders? Absolutely. So the 205s were about seeking clarity and a point where there were differing views on network load and other things. And so getting those 205s filed was about getting clarity while this concept is discussed, right? And so do we want to work with stakeholders when thinking about what is the right tariff, whether it's the state or federal level? Sure. But the 205s were around seeking clarity and getting certainty so that if someone was looking for certainty today.\nThat's the fastest path, right, while that is being discussed at PJM or with our states as it relates to large load. And then on the deposits, yeah, we are seeing meaningful deposits come in as we see meaningful load growth. You look at ComEd, for example, in our driver's tables; you can see our large consumer or CNI class is growing 4%, weather normal year-over-year. It's real, right? And so as that load comes into the service territory, driving up capital investment, but also we get those deposits to protect our other customers to make sure that the load shows up. When you look at 2024 rate base, just to give you a sort of size of impact.\nOur 2024 rate base was around $400 million lower. So relative to our last disclosure, the large majority of that was deposits. And so to your point, it does reduce rate base, but it's all a good thing, right? It's good for our customers that we're protecting them with the deposits, and it's a signal that there's more investment that we need to do to accommodate this new load, which is really exciting, right? We also added a disclosure in the back that shows our historical load while gross was growing, our net load was declining due to energy efficiency, solar things, and investments.\nNow you look forward, our gross and net load is growing somewhere between 1% and 2%. Exciting development in terms of economic development, but the deposits, that's how they show up, and that's kind of the order of magnitude we saw in 2024 as an example.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nJulien, if I can add something to Jeanne, we shared with you on our last call that we don't even put anything into our LRP or our forecast until certain actions are taken by these developers. One, we look at the purchase of real estate. Two, we look at, hey, are you putting in skin in the game in terms of developing plans? Or three, putting down a deposit. And then and only then, do you see us actively start integrating this into our plan? And that's why you see the load growth that we've projected to you that we've shown on the slides really adding up because once they take some actionable steps, we then include it into our plan.\nRight. Basically, as I said, for as much as you might see an acceleration in these deposits through the course of this year as some of this load materializes, you may very well see a corresponding increase or even net increase through the forecast period as that load growth is subsequently incorporated in your forecast. There's no net decline here. You're actually going to include the future CapEx opportunity in parallel with those deposits. So you shouldn't necessarily see this being any kind of reduction through the course of the year. You haven't gotten ahead of yourself in including that load. It'll happen in parallel.\nYeah.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Awesome. And does it speak to any greater confidence of these data points materializing? I know that there haven't been any kind of flashy data center press releases, shall we say, but these deposits presumably bode well and favorably for ongoing activities here. Should we expect any kind of more explicit disclosures as we work our way through the course of this year, especially given some of these, as you say, fruitful deposits here?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon",
    "content2": "Yeah. We do have one slide where we try to put kind of our recent wins. So slide 19 in the appendix, where you can see some of the recently announced data center projects that typically the operating company or the company does do a press release on. But we tried to give you some insight here. You can see we have over 200 online data centers today. I talked about ComEd's year-over-year growth, but if you look at the chart on that slide in the top left, you can also see just in the last couple of years, we've had a 24% CAGR over the last couple of years in terms of megawatts online. So it's real in terms of the number of data centers online in our territories.\nIt's real when you look at the load year-over-year on a weather normal basis, and it's real when you look at the pipeline that we see growing. And as Calvin mentioned, it's a pipeline that we only talk about ones that are what we would call greater than 80% probable because of the financial commitments that they've made. So it's an exciting time.\nI think we see this trend continuing, but I think we're going to be prudent about it and always focus on affordability and think about our other 10 and a half million customers too, and that's where something like the deposits shows up and our activity at FERC as we think about just an equitable transition to this higher load growth as well.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you guys very much. See you soon.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Your line is open.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks. Hi. Good morning. So just maybe following up on that last topic a little bit, I guess specifically, this was a topic in the Illinois grid plan on large loads. Could you give us—and I think they kind of pulled out the capital for that, but you're expecting it—can you give us maybe some info on what you have for the Illinois large loads in the capital plan? [crosstalk] Absolutely. Jeanne. And then related—yeah, go with that first, yeah.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nOh, sure. Okay. So yeah, so on the grid plan, all distribution, and what we had there was about a little over $400 million of capital that was not approved. But in the remarks on the grid plan, they commented, right, that this can be fully reconcilable through the annual reconciliation should ComEd's forecast be correct, which we believe it is. And so that's sort of the magnitude on the distribution side. And then when you look at on the transmission side, ComEd was up about $1 billion plan over plan on the transmission side, and it's really driven by this high-density load and the megawatts that we see coming online in the service territory.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nAnd is there a way to, or related to that, is there a way to take some of the data center gigawatt data that you're giving and tie it into some level of CapEx or gigawatt? I know everything's different, but just is there some, yeah.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And to your point, because every project is different, of course, we always try to do it in the most efficient way. So we work with our customers to say, How much do you need? Where do we have capacity? And so there could be very minimal investment need as we work to sort of find those sweet spots for our customers when we think about our entire customer base. And then there's others that, depending on their ramp, how much they need, and where they want to be located, there could be capital investment needed. So hard to do a rule of thumb.\nI would say, again, so that's why we kind of always point back to just the percentage of transmission as we think about the four-year plan and how that shows up. And again, $3.5 billion for this four-year period, 80% of that is transmission, really driven by these high-density load centers coming in and the economic development we're seeing across the territories.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. One last question. Just the new FERC chair, Christie, was, I think, quoted last week saying he'd have more clarity on their policy on the co-location in the near future. Do you think that will be in your 205 case, or what of the several cases is the likely forum to have clarity?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYes, Steve. To your point, I think clarity is the key word there and what we're driving for and seeking. Colette and her team are working regularly with FERC and others. So Colette, would you like to elaborate?\n\nColette Honorable\n\nChief Legal Officer, Exelon\n\nThank you. Good morning, Steve. We, too, are interested in this clarity, so we're pleased to see the chairman now, a month plus in the role, really focusing on this. Look, the great news is that we are all focused on this issue. We all recognize this time we're in, and we all want to be prepared to meet the demands of our customers and the needs of all of our customers as quickly as we can. So as we mentioned earlier, the decision on the 205s could be anytime, but by 24 February 2024, so it could be as soon as that.\nAnd there could be some decision on any of the other pending dockets.We are looking forward to getting the clarity, and more importantly, you can count on us to continue engaging. This is an exciting time, and we look forward to supporting our customers, all of them, today and in the future. Great.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nThank you very much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning, Calvin. Good morning. Just real quick, Jeanne, just real quick, I know there's a lot going on this morning, but just a question on CMC and the status of it. Is there any sort of progress of conversations with IPA and other stakeholders on managing that roll-off? Anything we should be watching, I guess, in the coming months from the public side that could indicate progress, legislative solution, is the governor involved, etc.? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nJeanne, please.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think Illinois is just like all of our other states, right? As they think about energy security, the CMCs are a unique thing for sure, right? And they go through 2027, which is actually quite nice when you think about the next capacity auction coming in prior to that. But the CMCs are not a perfect hedge either, right? They're more so on the energy side and less on the capacity. So our customers in ComEd are already seeing some of that capacity increase during this time period. But I guess from our perspective, we look at it no different than any of our states in how we're leaning into the energy legislation to provide solutions.\nIllinois is unique in that they have the IPA, and so they'll do their thing, and they'll think about how they want to procure, but we'll be there to help support from a customer lens perspective and do everything we can to ensure that what we're looking for, what our customers need, is definitely the reliable generation, but stable and predictable energy and capacity prices that allow them to run their businesses and meet their homes and family needs. So I guess we just. Illinois is no different than the other states that we're working with. We've got to find solutions at PJM on the capacity market.\nColette talked about that. We're very supportive of some of the solutions that they've provided and pleased to see that FERC has already approved a couple of them. But we're also supporting our states, Illinois included, that are looking at a variety of options. It could be looking at capacity obligations for a large load. It could be looking at state procurements. It could be looking at state integrated resource plans. So a lot of options on the table, but what we're most pleased about is those options are being considered and states are moving with a sense of urgency. And so Illinois, no different than the other states focused on this.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. And then just lastly, guys, thanks for fitting me in, is we haven't had an update on Artificial Island discussions with PSEG or CEG. Have you done any work on bill impact if Artificial Island went behind the meter for Atlantic City Electric customers? And if it's a side-of-the-meter deal or a quasi-front-of-the-meter deal, how should we think about how quickly a DC can connect to that system? Thanks.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. We haven't, I think in our 205s, we had some examples of what the impact could be in terms of a cost allocation, and so I would just point to that. But at the end of the day, I'll just reiterate, we're not against co-location. What we have always said is that the principles are we believe it's network load and that the right cost allocation should be in place. So not against it. It's not something that, as long as it's network load and we have the right cost allocation, it's bringing some economic development to our service territories, is always something we're supportive of.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. So I guess, Jeanne, the question is, can you connect the DC pretty quickly on the Atlantic City Electric system? Is there any speed-to-market issues? Is there open capacity there? Do they have to sit on a long interconnection queue? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I mean, I would say, I mean, specifically, it really depends upon what they will locate there. I think for all of our connections, wherever we're talking, whether it's Artificial Island or anyone in our system, we certainly look for where there's capacity. We look for their ramp-up. We look to make sure that we do our studies as accelerated as possible to make sure that we understand the effects.\nI would say, in most, I'll say more in general, in almost all of our discussions with our different customers that are coming to look to a state of states, we're almost always able to find a way that meets their time needs. Again, a lot of it gets into how much load, how quickly they want to ramp up, and we're finding ways to work creatively with them and accommodate that.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nFantastic. Thank you, guys, so much. Congrats, Calvin and Jeanne, on the results. Very good results. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Shar.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you all again for your steady support of Exelon. I think Shar captured it when he congratulated Jeanne and I. Let me just congratulate the 20,000-plus Exelon employees because of all the hard work you put in. 2024 was a successful year. We are very excited about the year ahead, which brings unprecedented opportunity for us to continue to lead this energy transformation with our jurisdictions and continue to provide long-term value for all stakeholders. We look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead. Michelle, that concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all of our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."

In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures.\nReconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the call and are pleased to be reporting a solid second quarter of earnings and operational performance, keeping us on track to deliver consistent and stable performance once again. We expect to deliver within our guidance range of $20.40-$20.50 with the goal of being at the midpoint or better. And we are reaffirming all of our long-term guidance. That includes investing $34.5 billion to grow rate base at 7.5%, resulting in annualized earnings growth of 5%-7%. For the quarter, we delivered $0.47 per share of adjusted operating earnings above our expectations, driven primarily by favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, along with timing of spend and ComEd's distribution revenues. We also performed at operationally high levels, achieving top quartile or top decile reliability performance across the board.\nWe have also continued to make progress on the regulatory front. Our revised grid plan process in Illinois is on track, and approval by the end of the year is a top priority. Since our last earnings call, we are through two rounds of testimony from staff and interveners, and we have narrowed open issues with many interveners and staff. We will continue to work with parties to address open items in advance of the evidentiary hearings. We are encouraged that we've been able to reach agreements with key parties like the City of Chicago, the Building Owners and Managers Association, and the Environmental Coalition, an NGO. Each has recognized the progress made in our revised plan and its compliance with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, a key focus of the commission. These affirmations are good examples of what differentiates the process this year.\nApproval of the plan will ensure that Northern Illinois will receive the investment needed to maintain an affordable, resilient, reliable, and clean grid for its customers and will support the state's success in attracting new business. In addition, the process for our PECO rate cases remained on track for orders by the end of the year. Pepco DC's rate case continues, where we await a final decision in its second multi-year plan upon completion of the briefing schedule on 30 August. Finally, we received an order in Pepco Maryland's second multi-year plan rate case filing, which adopted a one-year framework with the ability to refile for new rates while we await the outcome of a lessons learned process in the state.\nNow, the shortened rate plan maintains some of the positive elements of multi-year rate making, such as a reconciliation and the ability to update rates next spring, offers an opportunity to keep rates more current with costs. All stakeholders, including Exelon, are interested in making sure the investments we make keep us on track to meet the goals of Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act while appropriately balancing interests across stakeholders, all stakeholders, which includes customers, policymakers, and regulators. There are many ways to strike that balance, and rate-making constructs are a key tool to do that. We think multi-year plans provide a great foundation, offering unparalleled transparency, accountability, and alignment, including a reconciliation process that allows all stakeholders to understand how we performed against the approved plan.\nBut alignment on an agreed-upon path forward that works for everyone is critical, particularly since the need to invest in the grid is only growing with increased electrification, diverse and sophisticated power supply and demand technologies, and the increased strain on our grid caused by severe weather. The growth in investment has only accelerated as the proliferation of artificial intelligence has significantly boosted data center development, as Jeanne will discuss in her remarks. The stakes are simply too high to lack confidence that we are prioritizing the investments most important to our customers. Multi-year plans can provide that confidence and transparency to customers and, when done right, ensure alignment with all stakeholders. We are refining our regulatory strategy to follow the lead provided in the final order.\nMore importantly, we stand ready to engage in a lessons learned process to ensure we can find common ground on any adjustments to address stakeholders' areas of focus. In the meantime, given the deviation from the approach used by the commission since 2021, we are taking action on the current order and seeking more clarity, as Jeanne will discuss in her remarks. Now, turning to our operational performance on slide five, you can see that our performance through the first half of the year remains strong. ComEd and Pepco Holdings are performing at top decile levels despite ComEd experiencing four times the amount of storm activity in the second quarter versus last year. I just want to pause and say how incredibly grateful I am for the committed employees that serve on the front lines during these increasingly challenging storm seasons.\nJust in the past few weeks, our ComEd crews headed down to the Gulf Region to provide mutual assistance after Hurricane Beryl, only to come back to respond to four waves of back-to-back storms in Illinois in which there were 41 confirmed tornadoes impacting 500,000 customers. ComEd experienced the most severe storm in its territory in more than 15 years. And yet, within two days, we had restored 80% of the impacted customers, which is a true testament to the importance of prudent grid investment and our employees' relentless dedication to our customers. We can't thank our employees and those providing mutual assistance enough for their commitment to serving all of our customers. This operational excellence is matched on the gas side as well.\nNow, on the safety front, I'm pleased to report that BGE, PECO, and Pepco Holdings are all now top decile, with PECO improving from second quartile into the first quartile. Our utilities continue to leverage our new safety observation platform to take action before an incident occurs, with over 1,000 supervisors and safety professionals trained on our new tools. ComEd is continuing to build upon this focus with the goal of moving into the top quartile, and we look forward to sharing more on its progress on our next earnings call. Lastly, our customer satisfaction scores remain consistent with prior quarter, with ComEd and PECO in the top quartile, Pepco Holdings in the second quartile, and BGE in the third quartile. Pepco Holdings and BGE have both made progress toward improving their performances, implementing actions based on the findings from their customer experience working groups and data analytics.\nCommon actions to improve performance include enhanced accuracy for time-to-restore communications, greater self-service options for new business and interconnections, and customer assistance campaigns targeted at newer groups such as moderate-income customers. We look forward to the second half of the year bringing continued operational excellence and delivering industry-leading value to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Jeanne to cover our financial and regulatory update. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update, along with the outlook for the second half of 2024, our progress on the rate case schedule, and highlight two projects that demonstrate the breadth of our opportunities associated with growing load and infrastructure demand. Starting on slide six, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings block. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.47 per share in the second quarter of 2024 versus $0.41 in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher results of $0.06 per share over the same period.\nEarnings are higher in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.06 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments and completed rate cases, net of associated depreciation, and $0.03 of favorable weather, partially offset by $0.03 of higher interest expense due to higher levels of debt at increased interest rates. As Calvin mentioned, we delivered earnings results above the guidance we provided in our prior quarter call due to favorable weather conditions, early execution of our weather and storm recovery plan, and timing of ComEd's distribution revenues. Operating earnings of $1.16 per share through the first quarter of 2024 reflect 47% projected full-year earnings, which is in line with how we performed through the first half of 2023.\nAs we look ahead to next quarter, we expect the relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be largely in line with prior year at approximately 27% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range. Our outlook for the second half of 2024 assumes fair and reasonable outcomes for Pepco DC's multi-year plan rate case, and the BGE and ComEd reconciliation, and it incorporates July weather and storm activity with assumed normal conditions for the balance of the year. On a full-year basis, we remain on track for operating earnings of $2.40-$2.50 per share in 2024, and we reaffirm our long-term annualized operating earnings per share guidance range of 5%-7% through 2027, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.\nTurning to slide seven, as Calvin highlighted, there have been some important regulatory developments across our utilities that I will review, beginning with ComEd. Coming out of two rounds of staff and intervenor testimony, we are encouraged by the support that ComEd's revised grid plan is compliant with the requirements of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act and that it represents an appropriate balance between affordability and supporting the state's clean energy goals, with our proposal representing an average annual increase to the total residential customer bill of only 1.8% through 2027 relative to December's final order. ComEd filed its rebuttal testimony with the Illinois Commerce Commission on 31 July, marking the end of written testimony and another key milestone in the procedural process.\nThe company and parties to the case head into evidentiary hearings in mid-August, followed by the briefing process in September, and a proposed ALJ order in mid-October. A final order is expected in December 2024 for rates that will go in effect by the start of 2025. Turning to Pennsylvania, on 16 July, PECO filed its rebuttal testimony with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in support of both its electric, and gas distribution rate cases ahead of the hearings in early August. The cases are following the expected schedule, with orders anticipated from the PAPUC before the end of 2024. Moving on to Pepco Holdings, on 30 July, the DC Public Service Commission held legislative-style hearings to rehear oral arguments from key stakeholders and Pepco DC on its pending multi-year rate plan filing.\nWe are committed to working with DC towards their goals to meet their energy transformation aspirations, having at the commission's direction provided an extensive lessons learned from the first MYP and supplemental testimony detailing each of the benefits, as well as enhancements and modifications to improve the MYP framework. Based on the latest procedural schedule, which concludes with the post-hearing briefs in late August, we anticipate a final order in Q4 of this year. I'll close by providing an update on the Pepco Maryland final order we received on 10 June, which adopted a one-year plan with a total revenue increase of $44.6 million and a 9.5% ROE. We appreciate the ability to file for new rates effective at the end of the one-year plan and the ability to reconcile eligible costs in excess of those approved.\nWhile we were disappointed not to receive rates over the full period requested, we remain committed to engaging with the Maryland Public Service Commission on its lessons learned process, which we anticipate will commence next year. As Calvin noted, we believe strongly in the merits of the multi-year plan framework, and we embrace the opportunity to discuss ours and other stakeholders' learnings after three and a half years operating under that contract, where we've consistently delivered above-average reliability under below-average rates. In the meantime, Pepco is requesting that the commission rehear and reconsider certain aspects of their decision, including some of the spend proposed for removal from the plan. As always, we advocate for transparency, accountability, and alignment in the rate-making constructs in our jurisdictions and are prepared to work with each to ensure a just and equitable energy transformation for all.\nMore details on the rate cases can be found on slides 20-30 of the appendix. On slide eight, we highlight two projects that showcase the power of our footprint and platform to attract and meet a variety of low-growth opportunities. This growth is driven by continued momentum around AI-driven data center demand, onshoring of energy-intensity industries, and overarching economic development, electrification, and decarbonization trends. In June, ComEd joined Compass Datacenters to launch one of the largest-ever Illinois data center projects, bringing over 1,000 construction jobs to the nearly 200-acre former Sears headquarters campus. The project helps ComEd further advance economic development in the area and is a great illustration of why Northern Illinois ranks within the top five in the nation for data centers and is a top attraction for other high-density load customers.\nWith ComEd having 25 years of experience working with data center customers and recognized for its best in nation reliability last year, companies in energy-intensive industries are drawn to the region due to strong infrastructure, ideal climate conditions, access to talent, and affordable rates for all customers, supported by our ability to deploy investment in an efficient manner. This growth in high-density load, not just in data centers, but also in solar panel production, EV battery manufacturing, hydrogen production, quantum computing, and other industries, is one of several drivers for why our transmission spend increased by 45% in our four-year plan, as discussed in the Q4 call and shown again in slide 13 of the appendix. It also drove a significant update in new business in our refiled grid plan, with final spend eligible for full reconciliation under the multi-year plan framework.\nSupporting this development ensures the economic vibrancy of our communities, as last year alone, ComEd was part of securing 15 new commercial projects that are set to add over 4,000 jobs and more than $8.6 billion of local investment. Shifting the focus to Maryland, BGE is playing a crucial role in transforming the Baltimore Peninsula into the city's newest and largest mixed-use community. The area, which will benefit from multiple new or rebuilt substations, will help to relieve capacity constraints and provide grid resilience to both new and existing customers, accommodating 100MW of load and supporting the connection of distributed solar and EV charging stations. The 235-acre project will result in new and redeveloped mixed-use and residential buildings and host the new Under Armour Global Headquarters, playing a central role in the revitalization of South Baltimore.\nAs the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer count, we are an integral partner to areas like Baltimore City for revitalization and economic development, addressing aging infrastructure challenges, the need for new development and electrification, and the capacity constraints from increased load. As these two projects highlight, we are uniquely positioned to support our jurisdictions to meet load growth demands in an equitable manner, no matter where the load is located. We operate in six utilities across seven jurisdictions, including BGE, are a leading operator in the sector, and provide a world-class customer experience with bills and rates below national averages. Beyond our size, scale, and operational excellence, we have our excellent platform to unify our utilities that allows us to support customers at a national level, identifying attractive locations to support incremental load in states with progressive clean energy policies.\nThe momentum around new business in our jurisdictions continues to be very strong, a testament to the power of Exelon's platform. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on slide nine. As a reminder, we continue to project to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the downgrade thresholds of 12% specified by S&P and Moody's, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. While we await specific guidance on implementation of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, I'll remind you that our plan incorporates the assumption that the regulations will not allow for repairs.\nIf implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan, likely putting us in the higher end of our targeted 100-200 basis points of cushion. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised $1.6 billion for ComEd and BGE in the second quarter, now having completed 90% of our planned long-term debt financing needs for the year. The activity to date, along with our pre-issuance hedging program, positions us well for the balance of the year and beyond. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt relative to the sector, which is proof of the strength of our balance sheet and our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with low-risk attributes.\nThere has been no change in our guidance to issue $1.6 billion of equity from 2024-2027 to fund our estimated $34.5 billion capital plan in a balanced manner. We continue to expect to issue approximately $150 million this year and to balance rationally over 2025-2027, approximating $475 million annually. We will update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jean. I'll conclude by bringing it back to our priorities this year listed on slide 10. As always, safely achieving industry-leading operational excellence is our first priority. Keeping customers online no matter the weather is increasingly important. We also remain highly focused on being responsive to our customers' increasing engagement with the grid, whether it's accommodating new solar, performing efficiency audits, or supporting their transition to electric vehicles.\nReaching fair and balanced rate case outcomes that allow us to invest for the benefit of our customers is another critical focus. As you heard from Jeanne, we have a number of proceedings we expect to conclude in the second half of the year, and we're optimistic about the clarity that we'll bring for the next several years of our plan. Building a reliable and modern grid requires reliable and modern rate-making, and we'll continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that we are all aligned as we work to meet each state's energy goals. Next, we are focused on executing on the financial guidance we laid out, including investing $7.4 billion of capital with a balanced funding strategy and earning a consolidated 9%-10% return on equity, allowing us to deliver in our earnings guidance range of $2.40-$2.50 per share.\nAs always, we're focused on ensuring all customers are benefiting from the generational energy transformation that's just getting underway. In late June, many of you saw that we joined a first proceeding to raise concerns about the way co-located customers share some of the costs of the grid that they can rely on. Exelon and AEP may have been the first to share those concerns, but many others have now echoed similar perspectives. There's no question that co-location offers a unique opportunity for our jurisdictions to attract business in an exciting emerging industry, and we welcome supporting our customers in this work. Serving more customers than any other utility in some of the largest, most critical cities in the country, we are a leader in investing in the energy transformation and supporting economic development.\nAs Jean shared, there is no shortage of work that the energy transformation requires of the grid, regardless of where the load shows up, of what sort of generation serves it. In fact, just a week ago, PsiQuantum announced a partnership with the state of Illinois, Cook County, and the city of Chicago to be the anchor tenant in the massive quantum computing development, the first of its kind in the nation, housing a utility-scale quantum computer in an operations center the size of five football fields. So we will lead in investment, but we will also lead in affordability with rates and bills that are currently below national averages, and we're committed to continuing to do so to ensure we can maintain the service our customers expect while making the necessary progress in the energy transformation.\nAccordingly, you can expect us to advocate for policies that continue to support investment in a grid that we all rely on, and that ensure these investments can be made as affordably and equitably as possible. We will continue to monitor the Berk ISA proceeding in which action by the commission is expected by 3 August, and stand ready to help advance solutions to the benefit of all customers. Gigi, we are now ready for any questions from the audience.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star one one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Jeanne.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Good morning, Calvin. How are you doing? Good. Good morning, Jeanne.\nSo Calvin, just coming off sort of this blowout PJM capacity print, we've heard some of your peers yesterday kind of highlighting that they're talking to their state policymakers on solving this kind of resource adequacy issue. I guess what conversations are you having either in Illinois, Maryland, or Pennsylvania on the backdrop at this point? And do you think we can see merchant new entry, or will states have to step in? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Shar. And as you know, we've had this discussion in previous settings around resource adequacy, but let me assure you that we, PJM, and a number of other stakeholders have been signaling concerns about resource adequacy for some time.\nPolicy has continued to drive a turnover in the generation stack, as you know, with Base Load replaced by renewables, and in the past year has brought huge advances in the power requirements with AI-driven data centers. Onshoring of intensive manufacturing has further contributed to the pressures. But this, of course, poses real challenges around providing reliable, resilient, and affordable power. It goes to my comments that I made, is that we have to ensure that the new rate-making, this rate-making systems align with the new constraints being put on the energy that's being provided for all customers. The price signals that we saw this week clearly indicate a need for infrastructure investments in our footprint, particularly in BGE, both generation and transmission.\nObviously, we're already doing that today, including the work we're doing on Brandon Shores' retirement, meant to address exactly the types of price pressures that this auction showed. We're already engaged regularly in meetings, and you should be assured that we're not going to step away from this. It's an industry-wide issue because at the end of the day, what they're going to look to utilities is for reliability and a resilient grid. All the other stuff is fine, but if those lights don't come on, that's when they're going to turn to us, and we're focused on that each and every day. I'll now turn it to Jeanne to just see if you have any further input.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. No, I think I'll just reiterate, right; it obviously signals to your point, Shar, the need for more generation. We'll see what happens on the merchant side.\nBut there's also the need for more transmission. Calvin talked about the work we're doing on the Brandon Shores. We're going to continue to lean in on that. We think there are some cost-effective solutions there. But there's also an expansion of kind of what we do today in terms of things to help our customers manage the affordability. So for example, energy efficiency. We've been doing energy efficiency in ComEd since 2008, and we hit a milestone this year where we marked $9 billion in customer savings since 2008. That's remarkable, right? That work needs to continue to expand and get smarter and better as more demand comes on the grid, and we're leaning into that. We also hit a milestone of hitting 1 GW of distributed generation under our rebate program in Illinois this year.\nSo we're going to continue, as you mentioned, having those discussions with our policymakers. What else can we do there? Good for customers, good for investment, brings down and addresses the competing demand because we want to bring that demand, right? We want that demand to come. We just need to manage the other side of it, which we're excited to do, and we've done before and we'll keep doing. And then on top of that, we're going to continue to focus on what we can control, and that includes our O&M, continuing to manage that historically been at that 2%, projecting to be at that 2%. When you know our customers are facing power price increases, well above that, and then just normal inflation. So we're doing a good job there. We'll continue to lean in there.\nBut I think, look, it's meaningful, and I think it opens up opportunities to provide solutions, and we look forward to doing that.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nAnd Shar, if I can add on to what Jeanne just added, the question in Jeanne's comments recognized that none of this operates in a silo. It's all connected. So when you see one lever being pulled, you can't ignore the other pieces, which is why the rate-making process is so critical, and the transparency and the discussions have to continue and be ongoing throughout.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. And some of us have covered the space long enough to kind of remember LCAP, MCAP 11 years ago, 12 years ago, and that obviously was struck down by the courts. Are you looking at a state mechanism to potentially own peaking assets in rates? Is that what you're referring to?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI would tell you that we're working with our commissions on all types of scenarios, that we shouldn't take anything off the table because we need to address this issue and ensure affordability and equity is at the forefront of all discussions.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then just on the Susquehanna protest, just lastly here, it's obviously a focus. FERC is slated to act shortly. I guess, assuming the amendment is not set for a paper hearing, how do you want FERC to resolve kind of the broader issue? Kick it back to the RTO, start an NOI for an eventual NOPR? Just any thoughts there? Appreciate it.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Let me just tell you, and thank you for the question. I know this issue has gotten a lot of attention, and for some reasons rightfully so.\nWe're on the cusp of major new sources of load, and it's a critical emerging industry that holds a lot of promise for us in the US economy. But let me add a bit of additional color on my prepared remarks, though I'm mindful that we do have an open proceeding with FERC, and we should learn more by the end of this week, as you know. Our protest to the Talen ISA is not because we're against co-location. We stated very clearly in the initial protest that we are not. We do believe that co-location offers some benefits and allows our jurisdictions to compete successfully for this business.\nAs I talked about, we have clearly proven that we're an attractive partner for data centers, as evidenced by Chicago being a top five market in this area for economic development, as evidenced that our participation in the RTEP window three at $850 million award received because of data center growth in Northern Virginia. For us, Shar, this is about rate design. Users of the grid should pay their fair share. While there may be unique opportunities to leverage land and equipment at generation plants to get data centers online quickly, they are still connected to the grid and are benefiting from a host of services that the grid provides to serve all of the load connected to it. You should expect us to continue to remain focused on economic development and, yes, affordability. We have to do that on behalf of our customers.\nThat's what you should expect from a world-class utility, that we can do both and really drive growth as we're doing across our jurisdiction, but not forego that for one customer over the other. That's why we're putting this in. Policy should not be determined in one-off bases, and we will continue to see what FERC says and then determine next steps.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. All right. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Talk to you soon.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Hey, wondering if you could give a broad perspective on what you're seeing in terms of state support for attracting data centers. It sounds like you had some encouraging things to say.\nJust, are you seeing any evidence of pushback in any areas or the opposite? Are there incremental signs that some of the key states, I'm thinking Illinois, Pennsylvania, continue to be supportive of bringing that industry to the state?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. David, this is Calvin. What I'll do is direct to your question, we're seeing a lot of momentum. Matter of fact, in our states, they've passed legislation to provide tax benefits to attract data centers. Mike Innocenzo, our COO, works across all of our jurisdictions with each of the CEOs to ensure, from an operations standpoint, we're set up to meet the demands and expectations of those customers. Mike, do you have anything you'd like to add?\n\nMike Innocenzo\n\nEVP and COO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think we've seen no shift.\nI think our states across all of our jurisdictions continue to see the opportunities created by data centers for jobs, economic development, and continue to be very supportive, but also continue to be very engaged in the process to make sure that it's done in a thoughtful way where it's fair and equitable across.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Excellent. Appreciate that color. And then in terms of maybe your specific kind of pipeline of data center projects, could you give additional color on what you've been seeing in terms of that momentum? Has it been largely focused in your ComEd service territory? What are you seeing in other states at the moment?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nWell, to tell you what, I have our CEOs. What I'm going to do is ask because I think we see the most activity right now, as you alluded to, it happening in Illinois.\nI'm going to ask Gil Quiniones as ComEd's president and CEO to provide more color. And then for Carim and/or David Velasquez or Tyler Anthony, if you guys have anything to add, please don't hesitate. Gil?\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nPresident, CEO, and Vice Chair Board of Directors, ComEd\n\nThank you, Calvin. It's been a robust market for data centers here in Illinois. We have over 5GW in what we call engineering phase, where data centers have paid us to start engineering their projects. Some of them actually have made deposits so that we can order large equipment like transformers and breakers. And then behind that, we have another 13GW in what we call prospects. So they're not yet in engineering, but they are knocking on our doors, making inquiries, very interested in coming to our jurisdiction.\nAnd we're one of the states where there is a specific tax incentive passed in 2019 to support the development and location of data centers in our state. Any other CEOs have anything you'd like to add?\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nAnd Marilyn, Calvin, I'll just add we remain committed to supporting data centers as they come. To date, we have seen a number of data centers that are actually up and operational, not the hyperscale that many are talking about today, but we still remain committed to helping drive that if the data centers do come to Maryland.\n\nTyler Anthony\n\nPresident and CEO, Pepco Holdings\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tyler Anthony for Pepco Holdings, the three utilities. I would say the same, whether it's Jersey, Delaware, or the District of Columbia and our portion of Maryland with Carim. Interest level has been significant with all the major players doing different assessments of different sites and criteria, Calvin.\n\nDavid Velasquez\n\nPresident and CEO, PECO\n\nDavid Velasquez for PECO in Pennsylvania is beginning to see increased interest, whether they're a couple hundred to several hundred MW. A number of those are in engineering studies already, and probably over the next few months have a few more entering engineering studies as well.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSo David, what you hear from the team is that we're actively engaged in that process. To date, we continue to ensure that from an operational and reliability standpoint, we're ready to meet the expectations of those large customers.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Yeah. Thanks for the input across the board. Very helpful.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishmann from Wolfe.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishmann\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. So just on, I guess, first on Illinois, you mentioned these agreements with some parties in the grid plan.\nCould you talk to kind of what parts of the grid plan they've kind of agreed to? And also just, I guess, the difference between what we've seen is the commission kind of ignore staff, ALJs, and other things, but does it make a difference if there's actually settlements as opposed to just views? Yeah. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nNo, Steve, thank you for the question. And as you and I spoke about, and we've shared very publicly, when we got that order in December, it's important to level set. At that point in December, we had not had a chance to engage with these new commissioners about what their expectations were. And as you laid out, we had been actively engaged with staff and stakeholders up to that point, and we thought we had about 85%-90% agreement on what we were going to do.\nThen the commission came in and said, \"It's not what we were looking for.\" So since that time, the engagement with the commission, we took their feedback and went directly to those stakeholders and said, \"Hey, if this is what the commission's wanting, how can we develop a plan to achieve that with the grid plan that will be recognized and also meet the expectations of you as a stakeholder?\" So the difference here is that it's with commission input, with staff working in alignment with the commission, and these stakeholders. Now, to your point, the commission will have the final say, but these agreements are key because it's done in alignment with what they've told us that they wanted. And it's just another marker along the way to show that we're making progress.\nSo it's much different now when you present something to the commission because they've already given input. Gil, anything you'd like to add there?\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nPresident, CEO, and Vice Chair Board of Directors, ComEd\n\nNo, I think that you've said it correctly, that these agreements signify progress towards the specific items that the commissioners cited in their final order. So there are two areas. One area is compliance and policy issues. These agreements basically codify alignment in those policy and compliance issues. Now, the rate case really is more on investments and cost-benefit, and we're narrowing our differences in that area too, leading up to the evidentiary hearing, as Gene mentioned, which will be on 14 August through 16 August.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSteven, I'll end with this: I'd much rather have an agreement than a non-agreement with them as we proceed and go forward. So to me, that's a significant step in the process.\n\nSteve Fleishmann\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. Just one clarification.\nSo I think there's, I don't know, there's like 11 metrics that need to be met. So could you just maybe tie in the answer of what's agreed upon to those metrics? Is there an agreement on the 11 metrics, or is it kind of more of a broad, yeah.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Yeah. You're talking about the commission's points, the points of compliance, Steve?\nYes.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYep. Yep. So we actually created a very specific chapter in our refiled grid plan to make sure that each of those areas where they cited a gap or deficiency, for us to explain how we're meeting each of one of those that they've cited in the final order. On top of that, we also engage each of the staff and stakeholders to make sure that what they're looking for when it comes to compliance and policy requirements are also achieved.\nSo in a way, if you read our refiled grid plan, we actually previewed the chapters with all of the stakeholders before we filed it, but we rearranged it in a way so that it's easier and clearer for the commissioners to see how we address those 11 gaps or deficiencies that they have identified.\n\nSteve Fleishmann\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. And I guess one other question related to the, I guess, colocation issue. Some of the other distribution utilities, including PPL itself, obviously support the filing as it is. And PPL, I guess, found it in the interest of their customers, the update. So I guess I would be interested in, did you pursue kind of trying to resolve this issue directly before you made this filing? Well, for us, to see if there was a win-win? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSo for us, Steven, when we found out about the issue out in Pennsylvania, it was a matter of public policy. We didn't have anything in front of us in terms of, \"Do you have an opportunity to enter into a ISA or so forth?\" What our issue came down to public policy, and that's why we intervened to understand what was going on and to give FERC an opportunity to opine. So to your point, we didn't have a specific Exelon utility contract for us to come to an agreement on. Once we made our filing, that's when we found out other things were happening within our jurisdictions that were taking place. And like I said, we will work with anyone to get these things done.\nMy piece on this is that if we can understand and fully grasp what the costs are and the benefits and how they're going to be allocated, we will have those discussions with anyone at any time. For us, when the PPL was about public policy and what's taking place, when you read PPL's opinion or intervening back into the process, what they said was that this wasn't the form for Exelon AEP discussion, although they recognized significant issues need to be addressed and someone needs to address them. Colette, do you have anything you'd like to add there?\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, Exelon\n\nThank you. Colette Honorable, I'm EVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer. Steve, I appreciate the question. I will, pardon me, add to Calvin's comments. We are very open to working with anyone on these rate-making issues, and this is what we are speaking about.\nWe appreciate that PPL has a different perspective here. The reason we got involved was because of the broader policy implications, and we need for FERC to provide that guidance through policy. That will help all of us. And most importantly, it will help us understand the impacts of these sorts of transactions on all PJM customers. And so we look forward to the dialogue and discussion. We'll continue to be engaged at FERC with all stakeholders, and most of all, our customers, because as has been demonstrated here this morning, we will continue to provide strong solutions for our large load customers, but that work has to be done in consideration of the cost impacts, the affordability impacts for all customers, and then ultimately, reliability.\n\nSteve Fleishmann\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Jefferies.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Paul.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Hey, Paul. Hi. Good morning, team. And thank you for focusing so much on affordability. I wanted to continue that a little bit. Just after the PJM auction, if you have a rough view on what the customer bill impacts could be across the footprint, like BGE in particular, and if you're going to kind of use this to advocate for acceleration of transmission procurement in the region.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Hey, Paul. It's Jeanne. We are still buttoning up all the calculations, but you can think of it in some of our jurisdictions, including BGE, it's going to be double-digit increases year over year. It depends on our jurisdiction in terms of the current capacity constraints, in terms of other contracts that are in place, but that's how we're thinking about it. It's meaningful and probably double digits in BGE and some of our other jurisdictions. But you're absolutely right.\nWe are going to—we've already been leaning in to the affordability discussion, and I think this just accelerates the solutioning for that, which is good. We need to get to solution, whether it's more generation, whether it's more transmission, which we stand ready to do and are already proactively doing that. And then I mentioned an expansion of the current programs that we have today that help our customers through our investments and connecting them to different resources in BGE space to help them manage their bills. So we look forward to that. And I think just reiterating, right, what Calvin said, policy is important. This energy transformation, we have always said from the beginning, is going to be expensive, and the ones that do it affordably will do it sustainably. And that's why we're focused on making sure that every dollar goes as far as it can.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Great.\nAnd I know everyone's focused on FERC and Susquehanna. Let's open the related but different topic in Maryland, Senate Bill 1, the colocation study. Just what are your legislative priorities there? And if you could give any additional context. I know there's been some strong comments filed by parties. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Hey, this is Calvin. I would say on the Senate Bill 1, it's all about, we will lean into the affordability discussion and what takes place and the impact on all the customers. So again, we think the process in which the General Assembly has laid out and working with and saying, \"We're going to have a very public process in here to have all stakeholders engaged in it,\" is what we want. We will adhere to what the regulatory body or the General Assembly lays out.\nWe just want all customers to have a voice in that process because otherwise, we as the utility will be the ones looking back and saying, \"Where were you at in that discussion in representing us?\" And that's important because if you do this, Paul, you know this, if you do this in a vacuum, then you have to react to the things that have happened already, and it's very difficult to effectuate good policy when you're trying to recover from something that's already occurred. And that is what I think the working group at SB1 will adhere to, and we will be involved in that process with everyone else.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Now, thank you very much, and thank you for keeping us all on the edge of our seats in the dog days of the summer.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nYou're welcome. Welcome back, Paul.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThat's right.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Anthony.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, team. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess if I could follow up on Steve's question on the FERC, the ISA proceeding. And just one is, do you have any idea if the commission wanted to hold hearings, the timing that would occur before a decision?\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, Exelon\n\nHi, Anthony. It's Colette Honorable, again. FERC has a number of options in terms of how to address the issues raised, quite frankly, by a number of stakeholders in that docket. As you've mentioned, one could be to set this matter for hearing should it find that there are outstanding issues of fact or law that should be resolved before ruling. Should it go to hearing, it could take a year.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nAnd so that would allow for an administrative law judge to hear the various perspectives of the parties that are allowed to intervene, and to consider them and make a ruling.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. And then the filing was made in conjunction with AEP. I'm curious on how do you—or how did they get—or how did they sign on? Did you solicit other utilities, and some AEP decided to sign on and others did not? Or I'm just curious. I understand that this is not about colocation. It's about rate design. It actually struck me that more utilities didn't sign on, and I guess that's the root of my question.\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, Exelon",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think at the end of the day, Anthony, there's a timeline by which you can respond, right? And so we responded quickly because, as we said, we're going to be a leader in investment.\nWe're going to be a leader in affordability, and there's key questions here. Look, this demand is coming either way, right? Whether it's colocated or not, that's going to require investment, and our focus is making sure the investment gets done for the needs of our customers and that everyone has a fair and equitable allocation of the cost of using the grid. And I think that's the bottom line.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. And switching gears, my last question refers to slide 8, and you talk about all the opportunity in Illinois. I guess given the low ROE that you received in the last rate case, would most of your investment or all your investment be focused on transmission? I guess is there a reluctance to maybe do distribution investment in Illinois given the lower returns that they're awarding?\n\nColette Honorable\n\nEVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, Exelon\n\nYeah. Some of it's D and some of it's T.\nSo there's a mix there. And the more high-density ones, we're seeing more on the T side. And you saw that in our update on the Q4 call. We added a lot of transmission to accommodate that high-density load. As it relates to the distribution, we have an obligation to serve those new customers. And so while it is a low ROE, we've got to manage that, get that work done. And at the end of the day, that demand coming in, right, helps from an affordability in spreading the cost of the grid. So the only other thing I'll mention is new business on the multi-year plan is outside of the cost, the 105 cap on the distribution reconciliation. So again, we need to get that work done and hook up those customers. It's for the benefit of all of us.\nBut it is a mix of D and T, and a lot more. We see more T coming.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Anthony.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nEVP and CFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Anthony.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Gigi. And as always, thank you guys for your interest and participation in our earnings call. As always, we remain open to answer any questions and just get feedback with you throughout the day or follow up to this. So I just wanted to say how much appreciation from the team at Exelon. We appreciate your interest in the company and just engaging with us. So with that, Gigi, this concludes the call.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew, and happy birthday. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our Q1 Earnings Call. We continue our focus on strong execution. We have started the year with solid operational performance and are on track to meet our financial expectations, and we are making good progress on the regulatory front, having concluded ComEd's rehearing process almost two months ahead of schedule.\nBut before I get into the details of today's call, I want to start by acknowledging all of the thoughtful outreach we received on the passing of my predecessor, Chris Crane, Exelon, and really, the energy industry wouldn't be what it is today without his leadership. All 20,000 of our employees are committed to furthering the legacy of the platform he established, and the culture of operational excellence he promoted permeates all aspects of the performance you see today.\nBeginning with our key messages on slide four, we earned $0.66 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.68 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We again faced well below normal weather across our jurisdictions along with significant storm activity, but having approximately three quarters of our revenues decoupled from load, balanced cost recovery mechanisms and strong operating earnings guidance of $2.04 to 2.50 per share, we are on track to deliver that.\nWe also continue to perform in the top quartile operationally across all of our operating company utilities. On the regulatory front, we have continued to make good progress as laid out in our Q4 call. A key goal this year is to improve our regulatory outlook in Illinois. We took a large step forward on 13 March 2024 when we filed our updated grid plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission.\nUpon hearing from the Commission in December, the ComEd team got to work the day after the order and worked tirelessly with key stakeholders over the next 90 days to create an updated grid plan that addressed the Commission's feedback. I am so proud of the ComEd team for their efforts to refile an updated grid plan that is thoroughly responsive to the ICC's direction, and we look forward to a final order which the Commission has stated should be received by the end of the year for rates effective at the beginning of next year.\nAnd in the meantime, we are pleased that the Commission approved an updated revenue requirement for ComEd in its rehearing almost two months ahead of the statutory deadline, which recognizes the investments made last year and the prudent expectations for continual investment in new business in Illinois.\nWe also filed electric and gas rate cases at PECO in late March. These rate cases will support PECO's expanded investment in infrastructure, and they will enhance programs and services for customers, including assistance for low-income customers, and support for customers embracing cleaner energy options.\nLastly, the Delaware Public Service Commission approved a settlement in Delmarva Power & Light's electric distribution rate case supporting continued investment in the reliability and resiliency of its grid. Jeanne will review more details around our regulatory activity shortly. Finally, we continue to reaffirm all of our long-term guidance, including an expected 5% to 7% annualized operating earnings growth.\nGoing forward. This will be driven by the significant investment needed to support our jurisdiction's energy goals, which we are committed to doing as affordably and equitably as possible. Turning to slide five, our streak of operational excellence continues despite the significant storm activity we saw across our territories in the Q1. In both outage frequency and outage duration, ComEd and Pepco Holdings achieved top decile performance, while BGE and PECO achieved top quartile performance. This also includes extremely high performance on the gas side of the business, where gas odor response rates were perfect at both BGE and PECO.\nWe also maintained strong performance in our customer satisfaction scores at ComEd and PECO, with ComEd achieving top decile in light of its lower performance at the start of the year. BGE has created several working groups to identify and address customer pain points highlighted in customer surveys and direct interactions. With 10 initiatives underway that include enhanced community outreach for energy efficiency programs especially targeted towards limited and moderate income customers, and a continuous improvement plan for new business, results are trending favorably in Q2.\nLastly, I'll spend some time speaking about our safety culture and performance. We achieved top decile performance on our metric through Q1 at BGE and Pepco Holdings, while ComEd and PECO sit in the Q2. As many are familiar, the measure we have historically used for safety has been OSHA Recordable. In line with the industry standard, this metric has been in place for decades resulting from legislation passed over 50 years ago.\nWhile OSHA Recordable served as a useful starting point to drive safe behaviors and accountability, it has limitations in its ability to focus efforts on the most critical areas. While the total injury rate for the industry has declined, the most severe outcomes, fatalities, have not. The power sector occupies a unique space in today's economy and the nature of our work entails significant physical risk more than most other business sectors.\nIn our efforts to advance our capabilities as a learning organization, we have worked with the industry to adopt a more targeted and comprehensive framework to monitor high safety risk situations to harness key learnings and further engage our employees. Such a framework is better suited for our industry to drive safety performance to the next level, and this approach not only better ensures our efforts are focused on the highest potential risk, but also helps measure the success of those efforts, evaluating the presence of safeguards as opposed to the absence of injuries.\nIn alignment with this strategy to focus on the highest risk safety situations, we are now reporting on our safety performance through the serious injury incident rate or SIIR. Given this safety metric now measures serious injuries, we're more focused than ever on doing as much as we can to operate at industry-leading levels, and any incidents are unacceptable based on performance to date. ComEd is refreshing all employees on serious injury prevention tools, including recognition of their empowerment to stop work if a situation is deemed unsafe.\nAnd PECO is focused on strategies to improve safety performance around motor vehicles, including a copilot program to identify and communicate passenger responsibilities for safe driving. I am very proud of our operations team for its industry leadership on an issue as paramount as safety, and I look forward to driving continuous improvement in this area. Jeanne, I'll now turn it over to you to cover our financial and regulatory update.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our Q1 financial update and progress on our 2024 rate case schedule, including key developments in Illinois. Starting on slide six, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings walk. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.68 per share in the Q1 of 2024 versus $0.70 in the Q1 of 2023, reflecting lower results of $0.02 per share over the same period.\nEarnings are lower in the Q1 relative to last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities, $0.03 of higher restoration and damage repair costs associated with a challenging storm season across the Mid-Atlantic, and $0.02 of lower return on ComEd's distribution investments, including no return on its pension asset resulting from the December rate order. This was partially offset by $0.07 of higher distribution rates at our other utilities associated with incremental investments net of other expenses.\nResults of $0.68 per share in the Q1 represents an approximate 28% contribution of the midpoint of our projected 2024 operating earnings guidance range, which is right in line with historical patterns but slightly behind where we expect it to be for Q1. This is a direct result of the continued warmer than normal temperatures in our non-decoupled jurisdictions and the challenging storm activity experienced throughout the first three months of 2024.\nAs we look ahead to the next quarter, the relative EPS contribution is expected to be approximately 15% of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range, which contemplates the update to ComEd's revenue requirement approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission to go into effect in May bills.\nIn combination with Q1 results, this would result in recognizing 43% of projected full-year earnings, which is slightly behind how we have performed historically but in line with our latest outlook given various new rates expected to go into effect toward the second half of the year across several jurisdictions.\nAs we demonstrated in 2023, weather-related volatility is a risk we expect to manage alongside other changes in the plan. The ComEd rehearing provides for incremental revenue relief relative to the final order, which underpinned our base case for the year. As we progress through the year, you can expect us to balance this opportunity with management of our costs, utility work plans, regulatory outcomes, and weather over the remaining quarters to deliver against the expectations laid out for the year.\nWe remain on track for full year operating earnings of $2.40 to 2.50 per share in 2024 with the goal of being at midpoint or better of that range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 5% to 7% from the 2023 guidance midpoint through 2027 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.\nMoving to slide seven, there are several positive developments to highlight in the ongoing regulatory matters in Illinois. Starting with the most recent. On 18 April 2024, the ICC issued an order on the rehearing of ComEd's December NYP order that reset rates, which went into effect in May, providing for an increase of $150 million in 2024 relative to the December 2023 order. The order also increased the 2025 to 2027 revenue requirements over the approved revenue requirements in those years.\nWhile we are encouraged, the revenue requirements on rehearing were largely uncontested, and the rehearing process was completed nearly two months ahead of schedule, obtaining approval of the Refiled Grid Plan remains top priority. That leads me to the next slide. Key development after three months of robust stakeholder engagement to address feedback from the Commission, in which ComEd hosted two public meetings and a series of six workshops on 10 different topics, the revised Grid Plan was filed with the ICC on 13 March 2024.\nBased on this engagement, ComEd made a number of changes to the original Grid Plan, including the following: first, we reduced overall investment levels and bill impacts by up to 30% to better ensure affordability for customers. We also included additional affordability analysis anchored around energy burden, which is the total home energy cost as a percentage of household income, and we demonstrated that new rates under the proposed Grid Plan result in electric bills at levels well less than half the threshold considered to be energy burdened.\nAnd third, we outlined in detail how every customer and community benefits from the clean energy transition, specifically through focused grid investments and disadvantaged communities. More than 40% of the benefits of grid modernization and clean energy have been demonstrated to support equity investment eligible communities customers.\nLastly, we enhanced our support for the value of grid investments to ComEd customers through a new cost-effectiveness framework. ComEd's analysis details the present value benefits of Grid Plan investments totaling over $7 billion as compared to the present value of the revenue requirements of $4.4 billion. These quantifiable benefits, driven largely by reliability and emissions reductions, do not capture other qualitative value like cybersecurity protection, safety, customer engagement, low-income customer assistance, and health improvements from improved air quality.\nThe Refiled Grid Plan not only satisfies all statutory requirements and supports the achievement of statutory objectives, it also represents a collaboration among ComEd Commission staff and other stakeholders on implementation of the groundbreaking Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. CEJA has put the State of Illinois on a path to advance ambitious plans to combat climate change, a goal that is equally important to policymakers and utilities alike.\nIn support of these objectives, on 7 March 2024 the Commission issued an order that a procedural schedule be adopted for the grid and rate plan proceeding that will allow the Commission to issue a final order in December 2024 and implement rates that will go into effect by the start of 2025. The administrative law judges subsequently adopted a proposed procedural schedule. In line with this timing.\nComEd also filed its final distribution formula rate reconciliation with the ICC on 26 April 2024, seeking a one-time recovery of $627 million in rates effective 1 January 2025. A key driver of the increase includes the impact of US Treasury yields that increased in 2023 relative to the prior years. As a reminder, the formula rate construct was historical in that it set rates based on prior year expenditures.\nAs such, in addition to collecting actual costs from 2023 trued up from 2021 and 2022 costs, the reconciliation reflects higher O&M expenses due in part to the inclusion of beneficial electrification and credit card convenience fees required by CEJA, as well as additional investments in infrastructure to support safe, reliable service for customers and growth of new business in the state, supported by its economic development policies.\nStorm recovery was also a material driver of the under recovery per statute. An order is expected on the reconciliation in December. As I mentioned, obtaining approval of ComEd's Refiled Grid Plan is our priority. Early approval of the rehearing, coupled with the adoption of a procedural schedule for an order on the Refiled grid plan before the end of 2024, are the first steps to getting Illinois back on track to achieve its clean energy goals.\nTurning to Slide eight as Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front for our east coast jurisdictions since the beginning of the year. Let me begin with the most recent filing. On 28 March 2024, PECO filed both electric and gas distribution rate cases with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.\nIn its electric rate case, PECO is requesting a $399 million net revenue increase by 2025 to support significant investments in infrastructure to maintain and improve safety, reliability, and customer service for its customers. To reduce the impacts of severe weather, PECO has proposed a storm reserve mechanism designed to defer storm cost variances to the balance sheet to be collected or refunded in the next base rate case.\nAdditionally, PECO is seeking to recover $111 million in its gas distribution rate case to support continued replacement of existing natural gas mains and service lines with new plastic pipe intended to enhance safety, improve service, and reduce methane emissions. As part of the case, PECO has requested a weather normalization adjustment designed to adjust customers' gas bills for actual versus normal weather on each individual customer bill when bills are issued.\nBoth the proposed storm reserve and weather normalization adjustments would reduce the variability of revenues relative to our cost and at the same time benefit customers by ensuring that they only pay for actual storm costs and by making their gas bills more predictable. Further strengthening the experience for our customers are the planned infrastructure investments to modernize the electric grid, make it stronger, more weather resistant, and less vulnerable to storm damage.\nDespite the impacts of several severe storms in 2023, PECO customers experienced the lowest power outage in company history, with 86% of PECO customers experiencing zero or one outage in 2023. PECO's investment plans outlined in the electric and gas rate cases are designed to build upon this strong foundation, delivering enhanced reliability performance to its customers. Orders are expected from the PAPUC for both rate cases before the end of 2024.\nOn 18 April 2024, the Delaware Public Service Commission unanimously approved Delmarva Power settlement agreement with modification for its electric distribution rate case. The settlement was for a $42 million gross increase in distribution rates providing an ROE of 9.6%.\nThe decision improves recovery of investments in infrastructure to maintain safety and reliability, and improve service for our customers. It also helps better align revenues with costs, specifically high storm expenses, through a newly established rider that allows for deferral of storms exceeding $5 million as permitted by Delaware law. Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on 15 July 2023, subject to refund.\nI'll close with an update on the progress in Pepco's electric distribution rate cases in Washington, DC, and Maryland. The procedural schedule in Pepco DC's multi-year rate plan filing has been adjusted to accommodate an intervener's request for additional time to review surrebuttal testimony from Pepco. Pepco anticipates DC's Commission to issue a subsequent order with an updated hearing and briefing schedule in the coming weeks. A final order is expected by Q3.\nAdditionally, in Maryland, evidentiary hearings were conducted and briefs filed in March and April respectively, as part of Pepco's pending multi-year electric rate case. The hearings allowed Pepco Maryland the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits afforded by a multi-year rate plan relative to traditional ratemaking. Multi-year plans in Maryland have enabled investments necessary to improve reliability and customer service, modernize the distribution system, and support state environmental goals that have served our customers and communities well.\nWe continue to believe Pepco's proposed investment plans are well suited for Maryland to meet its aggressive clean energy goals in an affordable manner. A final order is expected from the commission by 10 June 2024 per statute. More details on the rate cases can be found on slides 19 through 29 of the appendix.\nI will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on slide nine. As you heard on our last earnings call, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. While we continue to await specific guidance and implementation of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, I'll remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the regulations will not allow for repairs if implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact. We'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan, putting us more on the higher end of our targeted 100 to 200 basis points of cushion.\nFrom a debt financing perspective, we successfully raised $1.7 billion at corporate and approximately $1 billion for the PHI entities in the Q1. To date, we have completed 55% of our planned 2024 long term debt financing needs, including all of our corporate needs, positioning us well for any market volatility in the balance of the year. As a reminder, we continue the pre-issuance hedging program that was initiated in 2022 to manage the ongoing interest rate volatility.\nIn addition, we continuously monitor the capital markets and regularly assess our plans for future issuance, timing, sizing, tenor, and tranching strategy to ensure we achieve optimal outcomes. The strong investor demand for our debt offerings continues to be a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with a low risk platform.\nTo reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $1.6 billion over the 2024-2027 period to fund the estimated $34.5 billion capital plan in a balanced manner. Specifically, we expect to issue $150 million of equity at the holding company in 2024 and the balance of approximately $475 million annually over 2025-2027. We will continue to update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. I will close on slide 10 by reminding you of our 2024 business priorities, commitments, and the unique power of our platform. As always, we start with operational excellence, providing safe and reliable power to our customers. As the demands on the grid continue to increase, we remain committed to achieving regulatory outcomes that adequately balance stakeholder interests, supporting the necessary progress on the energy transformation. This includes completing the ComEd Grid Plan process in a way that allows sufficient investment in the grid to support Illinois energy goals.\nWe are focused on delivering on all of our financial commitments for the year, investing $7.4 billion of capital expenditures while earning a consolidated ROE of 9% to 10% and delivering operating earnings per share of $2.40 to 2.50 per share.\nAnd we expect to achieve this while executing on our financing plan to maintain a strong balance sheet. We continue our strong advocacy for equitable and balanced energy transition, taking advantage of the unprecedented federal support through IIJA for investment across the ecosystem while continuing our industry-leading efforts to strengthen our communities.\nAs you may have seen, we are proud to partner with the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation to open 81 STEM centers across various cities we serve including Atlantic City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Washington, D.C. We opened the very first of those in April in Lansdowne, Maryland and we are excited to give students an opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge, skills and confidence in areas like coding and engineering which are indispensable in the energy industry.\nWe also continue to focus on maintaining a long-term O&M trajectory that supports customer affordability while relentlessly pursuing opportunities to operate more efficiently as one Exelon. Executing against our established priorities and commitments year in and year out is what you would expect of a premier utility. In many ways, those priorities and commitments aren't new.\nThe foundation of operational excellence and a commitment to values that support the diverse communities we have the privilege and responsibility to serve was established long ago by Chris. He demanded continuous improvement from the businesses he ran while relentlessly advocating for sensible and long-sighted policies. And he was an equally strong champion of diversity and inclusion, including industry-leading efforts to advance equitable recruitment, retention, and promotion of women, along with award-winning programs in workforce development, supplier diversity.\nIndeed, he laid the foundation for the STEM Academy initiative that I highlighted moments ago. We will all miss Chris and we look forward to honoring his legacy by pushing Exelon to lead the energy transformation with the platform and culture that he helped establish. Gigi, that concludes our prepared remarks and we welcome any questions from the audience.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star one one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities LLC.\n\nAidan Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThis is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy.Just looking at Pennsylvania, there appears to be an abundance of natural gas growth potential in the Marcellus and Utica. If incremental demand materializes, do you see this backdrop and ample reserve margin supporting data center development in the state?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThe short answer is yes, and I would tell you that we continue to see significant activity around high density load growth in general. You know, as we discussed, as recently as our Q4 2023 Earnings Call, we have high probability of load growth not only in Illinois, but Pennsylvania. And I have with me David Velazquez and Mike Innocenzo who can provide you further color. But the short answer is yes and I'll turn it over to them to see if they want to add anything.\n\nDavid Velazquez\n\nEVP of Utility Operations, Exelon\n\nThis is Dave, just to add that we have continued to see. Different businesses, including some interest from data centers in the PECO territory, and we have the infrastructure to be able to support that both on the generation side and also have the transmission infrastructure. Again, would have to be reinforced in certain places to be able to serve those loads.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, and I would add, we have a governor that's very aggressive around economic development. We're an energy exporter in Pennsylvania, so the ability to utilize that for all sorts of growth. I would say in addition to data centers, we're seeing electrification, we're seeing development around the South Philadelphia area, so lots of opportunities for growth and all sorts of electrification. The key to your question for me is that the utilities in all of our jurisdictions, we will be a partner in economic development, identifying areas and opportunities to put the assets of our jurisdictions in play. Thank you for the question.\n\nAidan Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, that's super helpful. Then maybe just one follow up shifting to the PECO rate cases. Could you just talk more about the prospects of receiving approval for both the storm mechanism and weather normalization adjustment? Just curious, like have these been used before? Are they a first time ask in front of the PUC? And just like any points of contention you would highlight there.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGreat question and Dave is going to take that now.\n\nDavid Velazquez\n\nEVP of Utility Operations, Exelon\n\nBoth those mechanisms have been used or are being used. So if you think of the weather normalization on the gas, four of the six gas utilities already have a weather normalization adjustment, and one of the two that doesn't has applied as well for a weather normalization adjustment. And then on the storm reserve, one of the major electric companies in PA already has a storm reserve account similar to us. And another of the major utilities for storms uses kind of a rider, which is kind of like an automatic add to the bill. So both are mechanisms that are known and have been approved in the past in PA.\n\nAidan Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThat's clear. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGood morning. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask on ComEd, just as you think about getting the timing to getting clarity around the Grid Plan refiling, obviously the rehearing was resolved sooner than anticipated as you highlighted. Is there any potential for that refiling resolution to also come sooner or do you think it's really a December event?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nI do, Carly. This is Calvin. I do believe it's a December event. We continue to work the process, and I would tell you the fact that we did get the other ruling prior to the statutory deadline was a very positive outcome. But we continue to work with all the stakeholders to drive this process to conclusion. And if we get those rates into effect prior to the beginning of the next year, that lays the foundation for us to continue to work with the Illinois Commission and government to achieve the results they want out of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. But I do not see it ending sooner than that. Gil, you have anything you'd like to add?\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nPresident and CEO, ComEd\n\nNo, I think just a couple of important things to note. On its own accord, the ICC voted on an interim order to say that. They will decide on this by December. Subsequent to that, the administrative law judge on 11 April 2024 set forth the procedural schedule to guide it for a. Decision in December of this year.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. And then know that you've gotten a lot of the year's financing needs done during Q1. But just as you think about the rest of the year there, do you expect there to be any sort of impact relative to your base plan, just given the move that we've seen in rates here year to date?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nHey, Carly. No, I think getting that corporate financing done was important, and we had also pre-issuance hedge a significant portion of that, as we always do heading into the year. That's why we give you the sensitivity on an open year. It's about a penny absent any hedges. So we really, we work hard leading into the year to mitigate it, and then getting it done early in the year leaves any amount that isn't hedged sort of takes that risk off the table.\nThe other thing I'll note is coming out of the separation, we were holding a little bit more short-term debt than we normally do as part of that financing in Q1, we termed out all but $500 million. So that's all we carry in short-term debt, and that's typically what we would normally carry. So also completed that. Then in our operating companies, for the most part, interest expenses are covered, whether immediately through sort of reconciliations or over time as we recapture them in new rate cases. It's really the corporate exposure that we continue to manage.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGreat.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On slide four, we have laid out our key messages for today's call. First, we are pleased to share that final results for 2023 exceeded the midpoint of our narrowed guidance, delivering $2.38 per share of operating earnings, or almost 6% growth off of last year's guidance midpoint. This is the second year in our two years as a purely regulated T&D utility that we have delivered results in the top half of guidance. That is despite historically mild weather in the Mid-Atlantic, where PECO experienced its mildest year in the 50 years we have on record. We also executed exactly as expected on our financing plan, including issuing 1/3 of our original $425 million equity commitment. Operationally, we continue to set the bar for the industry.\nWe closed out another year with leading performance, setting records for performance at multiple utilities. As it pertains to our regulatory activity, we completed three rate cases last year and continued to make progress on the three others at Delmarva Power, Delaware, Pepco Maryland, and Pepco DC. We received a final order in BGE's second multi-year plan filing for rates effective 2024 to 2026. We were encouraged to receive an order that recognized the importance of investment in support of Maryland's energy goals and a thoughtful path towards decarbonization. We also reached a constructive settlement in Atlantic City Electric's rate case. The increased revenue requirement will support its smart meter rollout, its EV smart program for easy and cost-efficient charger installation, and other investments to maintain safety and reliability, as well as improve service for our customers in New Jersey.\nLast, we received an order in ComEd's first multi-year rate plan, and it was a disappointing outcome. First, the order failed to recognize the financial cost of ComEd's investment despite nation-leading reliability and low customer rates. It adopted a significantly below-average ROE, refused to reflect in rates the prudent share of equity, and removed any return on our pension asset despite that asset delivering over $1 billion in customer benefits and counting. But more importantly, it rejected our Grid Plan, which was carefully developed over almost two years through dozens of stakeholder workshops and presentations reaching over 1,000 people and bolstered by voluminous support in the rate case process. Support for the investment plan was very strong up through the administrative law judges' proposed order.\nIt's important to all of us that are working to meet our state's goals and serving our customers that we have a stable and certain regulatory environment. We'll work with all of our stakeholders to achieve such an environment and ensure that Illinois is a state that investors are comfortable committing to. As such, a key focus of this team for 2024 will be regaining momentum in Illinois and resolving some of this uncertainty. It is in no one's interest, particularly those in the Illinois communities we serve and live in, for the state to lose further ground in its opportunity to lead the energy transformation and forego significant economic opportunity. We will be working diligently with stakeholders to get it back on track. Jeanne will cover more of the detail around Illinois shortly, and additional details on other rate cases can be found in the appendix.\nOur last key message pertains to our projected outlook. Consistent with past practice, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window, with our guidance running from 2024 through 2027. You'll see that we have added $3.2 billion of capital to our four-year outlook, growing from $31.3 billion over the 2023 to 2026 guidance period to $34.5 billion over 2024 to 2027, an increase of over 10%. This reflects a number of updates across the platform to meet customer needs and jurisdictional goals, including the addition of transmission investments assigned from the Brandon Shores retirement and awarded in PJM's third RTEP reliability Window to resolve reliability issues from data center growth in the region. These additions are partially offset by the reduction of approximately $1.25 billion in ComEd distribution spend.\nWhile we are working to finalize the revised Grid Plan for our March filing, we believe our plan appropriately accounts for the uncertain regulatory outlook while ensuring customers continue to receive safe and adequate service, and we meet the basic requirements laid out under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This increase in capital expenditures results in rate-based growth of 7.5% from 2023 to 2027. As a result of the significant increase in investment, we have included in our four-year projections incremental equity of $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the net incremental capital and ensures we maintain a strong balance sheet as we lead the energy transformation. In addition, despite below-average returns we are receiving at ComEd, we continue to expect to realize a consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range.\nThe result of the plan is an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. Now, lowering our earnings growth outlook is not a change we took lightly, particularly given the amount of investment needed for this multi-decade energy transformation and our unique scale and platform to lead that work. Reducing investment in ComEd as a result of the final order lowered our expected rate-based growth, but it also provided us an additional opportunity to deploy capital in other parts of the system across our seven jurisdictions to serve our customers, particularly in transmission. I'll note that the financial benefits of these investments do take longer to play out. Given the larger scale and scope of transmission projects, they require more time to generate cash and earnings relative to the distribution investments they are replacing.\nBut we are confident that we can deliver at the midpoint or better of our annualized growth rate change of 5% to 7% over the 2023 to 2027 horizon and beyond, even after accounting for the potential that the uncertain process in Illinois may require significant further adjustments. And once again, Jeanne will speak more to these updates to our long-term outlook shortly. Lastly, for 2024, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.40 to $2.50 per share. This range gives us confidence that we can accommodate a variety of outcomes through the ComEd rehearing and Grid Plan processes, along with our typical risk and opportunities we see across our platform. We have also announced an annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024, reflecting 5.5% growth off of our $1.44 dividend per share in 2023, in line with our long-term earning growth, and approximately 60% payout ratio.\nMoving to slide five, I will review the 2023 commitments and priorities that we initiated on last year's Q4 call and recognize the significant progress we made across all of the areas that we prioritized as a pure play transmission and distribution utility, which is leading the energy transformation. First, it was another tremendous year operationally. You can see this not only in our scorecard, but the industry recognizes it as well. As we mentioned in our last call, ComEd won PA Consulting's ReliabilityOne Award as the country's most reliable utility. The best-ever performance at ComEd and Pepco Holdings speaks to the high quality of our workforce and our efforts to attract, engage, and retain talent. We also met all of our financial goals. We invested $7.3 billion of capital to serve our customers.\nWe earned a 9.3% return on equity, well within the targeted range of 9% to 10% that we target earning on a consolidated basis. As I mentioned, we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We executed as promised on our strategy to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet. We issued 1/3 of our existing equity commitment, raised debt at attractive interest rates at both our operating companies and holding company, and we took advantage of a variety of hedging instruments. We were very active and extremely successful in securing grants enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, securing close to $200 million in awards to support grid resiliency and modernization at BGE, PECO, and ComEd that will make our jurisdiction's progress on their energy goals more affordable and equitable.\nAnd further, to the focus on customer affordability, we again helped secure $550 million of federal, state, and local support for low-income customers that need assistance in paying their energy bills. We also made significant progress in our efforts to maximize value for our customers, institutionalizing a permanent team to discover and execute on opportunities to deliver industry-leading operational excellence for our customers at lower cost, which you'll hear more about from Jeanne. Lastly, we executed on a busy regulatory calendar, setting a rate case, settling a rate case at ACE, concluding another successful multi-year plan for BGE's electric and gas customers that aligns on an appropriate investment strategy for the next three years, and making substantial progress in our Delmarva Power electric rate case and Pepco multi-year plans. As we talked about, while we completed our ComEd rate case, it was a disappointing outcome for all parties.\nBut we've already begun to establish and execute on a path forward, and that's become our top priority in 2024. I will now turn to slide six to review how we closed out 2023 from an operational perspective. Starting first with reliability, we again kept outage frequency and duration at top quartile levels or above. ComEd and Pepco Holdings operated at best-on-record levels in both categories. Performance like this is not something that can be turned on and off overnight. First, it takes a talented and trained workforce, as I mentioned earlier, and we thank the teams that show up each and every day, no matter the conditions, to keep the lights on and the gas flowing, as they did during the severe storms and brutal cold snap that struck in January. Across ComEd, PECO, and PHI, over 500,000 customers were impacted. It takes investment.\nThe demands placed on our system by more severe weather, by an increasingly distributed and non-dispatchable generation fleet, and by an economy that's more and more reliant on electricity. They all require investment. That's why it's so important to us to have stable and certain regulatory environments. It gives us the confidence to execute on forward-looking planning to manage the pace of investment for the energy transformation and ensure the reliability that all customers deserve and rightly expect. On safety, performance will continue to be a critical area of attention for us in 2024. Our OSHA performance was lacking in 2023, and we remain highly focused on understanding and correcting drivers of underperformance at each of our utility operating companies.\nThe biggest drivers across all of our utilities continue to remain in the day-to-day basics like ergonomics and vehicle-related incidents, not the high-energy events that truly differentiate utility work and demand particular focus. But this substandard performance, even in the lower impact areas, is not acceptable, and I expect us to do better in 2024. Customer satisfaction almost universally improved in Q4, with ComEd rising into the first quartile. We are pleased that our efforts to ensure our customers see value in the service we provide are paying off, and we look forward to continuing this progress well into 2024. And finally, gas odor response remained at stellar levels, and we continue to deliver on what we have here, and I'm so proud of the BGE, PECO, Pepco, and Delmarva teams. There was a lot for our employees to be proud of in 2023.\nWe know we have what it takes to be a premier utility, and we execute it like one. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to speak more about our financial and regulatory update. With that, Jeanne.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Calvin. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our fourth quarter and full-year results, key regulatory developments in Illinois and across the platform, and provide annual updates to our financial disclosures, including 2024 guidance. Starting on slide seven, as Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the second year in a row, despite the historically mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions. For the fourth quarter, Exelon earned $0.62 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis.\nFor the full year 2023, we earned $2.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our narrowed guidance range and represent almost 6% growth off the midpoint of the 2022 guidance range. Throughout the year, we benefited from a higher earned ROE at ComEd, primarily due to rising treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE, as well as favorable depreciation at PECO relative to expectations. Additionally, the ruling in December on BGE's reconciliation from its first multi-year plan approved recovery for over 90% of the requested 2021 and 2022 amounts and established a precedent to record a portion related to the 2023 reconciliation, which is expected to be determined in a future proceeding.\nThese benefits, coupled with our ability to manage work plans across the platform, allowed us to mitigate nearly $140 million of weather and storm challenges relative to prior year, along with the labor strike in New Jersey that occurred late in the year, driving contracting costs up year-over-year. In a year in which we faced multiple headwinds, we delivered on our goal to achieve earnings in the top half of our guidance range. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix on slides 30 and 31. Turning to our outlook for 2024, we are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. With BGE and Pepco entering the next cycles of their multi-year plans, 2024 earnings are expected to grow approximately 4% relative to the midpoint of our 2023 original guidance range.\nCompared to our last update, the reduction in expected year-over-year earnings growth is driven solely by the 14 December rate order issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission and ComEd's multi-year rate plan, which we were only able to partially mitigate in 2024 with cost management, redirected investment to serve our customers, and margin we had built up in the plan. Outright rejection of the Grid Plan, the challenging financial support for our net distribution investment in the December order, and uncertainty around the amount of spend ComEd will be able to recover has caused us to dramatically reduce the originally planned level of distribution investment in Illinois this year. Until there is resolution on the Grid Plan, our 2024 plan has been risk-adjusted for the overall uncertainty and prudently assumes earnings at ComEd consistent with the December rate order.\nWhile the rehearing on the interim revenue requirement is expected to provide additional cost recovery until Grid Plan approval, we have not assumed this as our base case. Therefore, despite the uncertainty that remains with ComEd, we expect our 2024 range to cover a range of possible outcomes, from not receiving any rate relief relative to the final order to the prospect that we receive an approval of our revised Grid Plan. The uncertainty in Illinois will further cause volatile quarterly earnings shaping in 2024, both due to the significant rework of ComEd's operational plan in 2024, as well as due to the fact of the prospect for the rehearing and revised Grid Plan processes to impact ComEd's expected revenue requirements.\nWe currently expect to realize approximately 29% of full-year earnings in the first quarter, which accounts for the December rate order at ComEd, seasonal weather patterns, and the completed rate cases at our other utilities. Moving to slide 9, I would like to take a moment to step through the regulatory developments in Illinois since receipt of the ICC's final order in mid-December. First, starting with the application for rehearing on 22 December, ComEd acted swiftly to request the Commission correct fundamental legal and evidentiary errors around four primary issues with the final order: return on equity, capital structure, return on pension assets, and the basis of the ordered revenue requirement across all test years that was adopted absent an approved Grid Plan.\nAt an open meeting on 10 January 2024, the ICC granted one portion of ComEd's application, directing that a 150-day rehearing process reconsider the year-over-year revenue requirement increases absent an approved Grid Plan. While ComEd anticipates that the revenue requirements will be further updated upon approval of a revised Grid Plan, the rehearing order due on 10 June 2024 is expected to reset interim rates for 2024 at the discretion of the Commission. Immediately following the open meeting on 10 January 2024, ComEd filed with the Third District Appellate Court an appeal of the three other elements of the ICC's final order on which rehearing was denied. While there is no set schedule or deadline for an appeal conclusion, we will seek to move expeditiously through the court process. Separately, as directed in the final order, ComEd will file a revised Grid Plan by 13 March 2024.\nComEd has fully reengaged staff and all parties to the proceeding to align on the appropriate adjustments to the revised Grid Plan to fully address the concerns expressed by the Commission. We continue to believe significant investment is needed to support Illinois' clean energy goals and desire to promote economic development in the state, a fact acknowledged by all stakeholders. But the revised Grid Plan we expect to file will reflect the significantly below-average financial support provided in the final order and address the Commission's feedback to further prioritize affordability. We simply cannot invest at the same pace under an ROE that does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate and inflation environment. There is no statutory deadline for Commission action on the revised Grid Plan.\nHowever, the final order stated that the Commission appreciates the urgency of having a compliant Grid Plan in place and is eager to move forward with a Grid Plan that satisfies the statutory requirements for approval. And so we are optimistic for resolution by year-end. In response to the challenging rate order, our long-term guidance reflects a $1.25 billion reduction in ComEd distribution capital expenditures over the three-year period spanning 2024 to 2026 relative to our Q4 2022 disclosure update. This updated investment outlook for ComEd's distribution business includes reductions agreed to with stakeholders leading up to last October's proposed order, along with additional reductions that result in a plan that further balances priorities across our stakeholders.\nAs I will discuss later around our long-term outlook, our guidance has accounted for the possibility that substantially more capital is removed from the plan as a result of this process, despite significant broad-reaching support for our investment strategy. On slide 10, we provide our updated outlook for CapEx and rate base covering 2024 to 2027. We plan to invest $7.4 billion in 2024 and a total of $34.5 billion over the next four years, an increase of $3.2 billion, or over 10%, from the prior planning period. Though we reduced ComEd's distribution capital plan by over 18% in response to the final order, the multi-decade energy transformation continues to gain momentum, and we see no shortage of needs to invest for our customers across all of our service territories and an ability to do so at a reasonable cost.\nWe are the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer count, and we have the privilege and responsibility to serve many major densely populated areas. We operate six utilities across seven jurisdictions, including FERC. Beyond our industry-leading size and scale, we are also one of the best operators in the sector, providing a world-class customer experience for reliability at very competitive rates. Given the power of this platform, our updated four-year capital plan includes $3.2 billion of additional capital, net of the adjustments to ComEd distribution, to serve our customers. Included in that increase is $1.5 billion of incremental transmission capital over the 2023 to 2026 period since our last disclosure update, addressing the significant need for high-voltage investments to support federal, state, and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification.\n$725 million of that increase is projected at ComEd, where data center and other high-intensity load growth, along with increasing renewables and retirements of older fossil fuel generation, is driving increased transmission investment needs. The balance of the additional transmission largely relates to the two large transmission projects discussed on prior earnings calls: the RTEP Reliability Window 3 project awarded by PJM to mitigate reliability challenges driven by incremental data center demand in the region, and the other assigned due to the retirement of the Brandon Shores Coal Plant. While some of the transmission capital at ComEd is expected to go in service during the guidance period, very little of the transmission spend for the large East Coast project is reflected in the updated rate base outlook.\nBrandon Shores is expected to go into service in 2028, while the RTEP Window 3 project will be in service closer to 2030, providing line of sight to strong rate-based growth beyond the current guidance window. We continue to expect there will be transmission opportunity across our service territories associated with the same drivers underpinning these projects: high-density, localized load growth, traditional fossil fuel plant retirements, increased renewables, not to mention from our extremely well-positioned footprint on the Mid-Atlantic coast for offshore wind interconnection. To further put our competitive position into perspective, all but one mile of those two large transmission projects is expected to occur on our existing rights-of-way. We expect to remain active in seeking additional opportunities to lead in this space, and as always, we will only include spend in our plan that is identified and expected to proceed tied to the needs of our jurisdictions.\nIn total, our capital plan updates are expected to result in an increase to rate base of 7.5% over the next four years on a compound annual growth basis to $74 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.5 billion to rate base from 2024 through 2027 and reflects a shift in the mix of our total capital growth portfolio by 2% from distribution to transmission since the last disclosure update, despite a significant portion of the transmission capital added not yet placed in service. Exelon's transmission rate-based growth, recovered through FERC formula rates, provides a stable and predictable financial profile. As clean energy and electrification continue to grow, our transmission strategy is designed to adapt to this new paradigm while continuing to operate the transmission system at world-class levels.\nMoving to slide 11, one way to ensure sustainability of our capital growth profile is to continue delivering superior value as efficiently as possible to our customers and communities. And as one Exelon, we are building from a strong foundation. Our history of steady cost discipline while delivering a premier experience for our customers has positioned us very well, as you can see in the chart on the right. Exelon's investment in grid modernization has enabled an approximate 40% increase in reliability performance across the platform, whether based on outage frequency or outage duration, while maintaining average electric rates 17% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. More simply put, when a dollar is placed in our hands to invest, our customers can trust us to create value through reliable, affordable service.\nHad our adjusted O&M costs grown in line with historical annualized inflation rate of 3.5% from 2016 through 2024, they would have increased by approximately $1.2 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 2.4% CAGR for the same period, eliminating $400 million of customer rate increases that would have occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. And while 2024 is expected to grow at a higher rate, one key driver is the number of significant back-office and operational IT system investments whose savings will be monetized over a longer period of time, as I'll discuss in a minute. In addition, upon aligning with several of our jurisdictions on the spending programs associated with advancing their state's energy goals and priorities through the recently approved rate cases, we are anticipating some catch-up to meet the levels of service and investment agreed upon with our jurisdictions.\nHowever, we expect to maintain an annualized growth rate of approximately 2% through 2027, a below-inflation level that is expected to result in bills for customers over $400 million lower than they otherwise would have been. Our expectation to limit the annualized O&M growth rate to approximately 2% over the long term and maintain our competitive position with rates among those that are the lowest in the nation will improve our customers' experiences. In fact, our multi-year plan rate structures allow us to quickly flow any benefits back to customers. Let me take a moment to highlight a few ways in which we continue delivering value for our customers.\nFirst, as Calvin mentioned, a permanent team was established in 2023 to continue efforts to standardize and streamline the structure and operations of the organization, ensuring all of our efforts are coordinated with the sole purpose of serving our customers and communities in an efficient and superior manner. Second, we have several initiatives underway to upgrade major enterprise resource planning, customer billing, and automated work order systems expected to create work efficiencies, some of which I mentioned are driving our spend in 2024. Third, we are standardizing storm response protocol to increase role transparency and accountability in emergency events, mitigating cost risk, and improving restoration performance in the future. Fourth, we are delivering a framework to migrate from a preventive maintenance asset management strategy to an automated condition-based maintenance strategy in our transmission operations.\nAnd lastly, we are streamlining processes and leveraging technology, particularly in the call center and field, for increased efficiency and responsiveness to our customers. To ensure that our R&R needs remain strong and we can invest at the levels our jurisdictions want, we are committed to leveraging our size and scale as one Exelon to manage costs across our operating companies and deliver affordable rates for our customers. Turning to slide 12, with $34.5 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.5% rate-based growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are initiating an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share.\nThe lower growth outlook from what we previously laid out is not a decision we took lightly, but is a result of the challenging rate case outcome and decelerated pace of investment in Illinois. As you heard from Calvin, Illinois is only one jurisdiction in which we operate. We are continuing momentum in our other jurisdictions as the second multi-year plans at Pepco progress in line with our expectations, as PECO anticipates filing in the first half of this year consistent with their general two-to-three-year rate case cadence, and as all of our utilities execute on the robust transmission strategy and cost management initiatives outlined on the prior slides. Accordingly, we are confident the earnings CAGR will be at midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% range over the 2023 to 2027 period and in future updates.\nEven with the process in Illinois remaining uncertain, our earnings growth guidance is resilient and accounts for the possibility that limited progress is made in Illinois, and we need to significantly reduce investment in ComEd distribution further. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout ratio of operating earnings, with the dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings target. We announced today an expected annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024, which is over 5.5% higher than the 2023 dividend. Maintaining our commitment to transparency and predictability, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2027 on slide 13.\nWhile there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the four-year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our expected 5% to 7% growth through 2027, including an expectation to deliver every year after 2024 within the 5% to 7% range, if not above. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on slide 14. As you have heard from us before, maintaining a strong balance sheet is core to our strategy, and we closed out another year with credit metrics comfortably exceeding S&P's and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%. Similar to the first two years since operation, over the guidance period, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the thresholds specified by the agencies.\nWhile the final rate order issued by the Commission in Illinois negatively impacted our future cash flow outlook, we have largely mitigated those impacts through cost management and curtailment of distribution capital spend at ComEd, while ensuring we maintain a safe, reliable grid for customers. As we identify new investments in the plan, we are funding in a prudent manner by incorporating an incremental $1.3 billion of equity to ensure we maintain our previous commitment on cushion and keep us on a path to 13% to 14% consolidated credit metrics over time. As our consolidated spend profile has shifted more towards transmission, the cash generated from these longer-dated investments is expected to follow the earnings largely beyond the guidance period and further strengthen our credit metrics over time.\nAdditionally, I'd remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not allow for repairs. If implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics average on average over the plan, which would provide incremental cushion. From a financing perspective, we expect the $34.5 billion capital plan to be supported by $19 billion of internally generated cash flow, $10 billion of debt at the utilities, and $3 billion of debt at the holding company, with the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. In Q4 2023, we completed $142 million of equity via our ATMs and expect $150 million to be issued in 2024.\nAs mentioned, to fund the robust $3.2 billion of incremental capital opportunities while maintaining a strong balance sheet, our financing plan includes $1.3 billion of additional equity that we expect to issue over the 2025 through 2027 period. The incremental equity funds 40% of the incremental capital investments over the four-year plan and represents slightly more than 1% per year of Exelon's current market cap. As we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment at the utilities, we anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by no more than approximately 40% equity. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $35 billion of capital across our diversified platform from 2024 to 2027, driving 5% to 7% earnings growth from 2023 to 2027, with an expectation of midpoint or better and maintaining a strong balance sheet while doing so. Thank you.\nI'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. I'd like to conclude with our priorities and commitments for this year and remind you of Exelon's unique value proposition for the jurisdictions it serves, and its investors. As you'll see, they're very consistent with our focus areas for 2023, a good reminder that we aim to reliably deliver against a predictable and consistent strategy, as you'd expect from a premier utility. First, you can count on us to prioritize operational excellence and safety in service of our customers. As you may have seen, we announced the creation of a Chief Operating Officer position and named Mike Innocenzo, the CEO of PECO, to that role. Mike will build on the top-tier performance levels our customers have come to expect.\nIn succeeding him, Dave Velazquez will bring his wealth of experience and strong leadership to PECO. Both moves are a testament to the unparalleled bench strength that Exelon enjoys. Our Chief Human Resource Officer, Amy Best, has been instrumental in building that advantage. We wish her all the best in her next chapter and look forward to Denise Galambos' leadership as Exelon's new head of HR. Second, we expect to deliver on the prudent financial plan that we have laid out, spending $7.4 billion to invest in the grid on behalf of our customers and communities, earning a consolidated return on equity in the 9% to 10% range consistent with the cost of investing in the grid, and delivering earnings in the range of $2.40 and $2.50 per share while maintaining a strong balance sheet in executing our financing strategy.\nNext, we expect to reach collaborative and constructive outcomes in the rate cases we have underway, along with the ones we expect to initiate in 2024 to ensure we can continue to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers and help the states make their desired progress on their energy goals. We will continue our efforts to ensure the energy transformation is as equitable and affordable as possible. Building on our success in 2023, in mid-January, we submitted seven concept papers for the next $3.9 billion that the Department of Energy's Grid Deployment Office is making available under its GRIP program enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nWith proposals ranging from software across the enterprise to enable increasing levels of distributed renewable energy sources to targeted investment at Pepco Holdings to combat coastal impacts of climate change, they highlight our creative and far-reaching efforts to partner with our jurisdictions and creatively align local, state, and federal policy. Beyond accessing these funding sources, as Jeanne highlighted, we will continue our efforts to standardize and simplify our operations to manage the increases in cost associated with the expanding needs of the grid while delivering premium value to our customers. Lastly, what's distinct this year is a recognition that last December's final order in the ComEd multi-year plan did not bring the resolution on how to invest over the coming years in the first rate case process undertaken by the approach laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. While we are disappointed, we are not deterred.\nWe are committed to finding a path forward with stakeholders that restores certainty for our customers, employees, and investors. We believe everyone wants a level of investment that can deliver on the promise of CEJA and positions us to lead the energy transformation. And so we will be working toward that outcome while preparing to pivot if that's not the case. Delivering against these priorities while continuing to establish our position as a premier T&D utility, and slide 16 reinforces that value that we offer. Exelon's platform is incredibly unique. We have the privilege and responsibility of serving some of the nation's greatest cities with jurisdictions that recognize the unique opportunity they have to lead the energy transformation.\nOur asset footprint, the transmission and distribution network that is the lifeblood of making that transformation happen for our jurisdictions, is unmatched, as is our scale with over 10.5 million customers across our seven rate-making jurisdictions. We have been setting the bar for operational performance for years, and our ability to invest to support that performance is backed by strong, forward-looking, and predictable regulatory mechanisms. With our dividend yield at 4.5% and a 5% to 7% annualized earnings growth rate that we have a strong conviction in achieving, we are offering investors total shareholder returns in the 9.5% to 11.5% range and extremely attractive risk-adjusted proposition. I am so proud of this team for the commitments made and kept in 2023, and we look forward to doing the same in 2024. As always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take your questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, simply press star one one on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Calvin, starting with Illinois, I mean, the team has had a few months now to digest the order. You're not alone in facing sort of that order from the ICC. I mean, both the electric and gas guys have throttled investments, and they've laid off workers. I guess, what did you guys miss heading into that final order? But really more importantly, why is this current distribution spend now appropriate? Is it a floor kind of position for upside? Jean's comments for 2024, kind of broad with upside and downside. So just trying to handicap the path forward with this new guidance. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Thank you, Shar.\nAnd as both Jeanne and I expressed, disappointed with the outcome. And the disappointment, I'll frame it first, that despite the high level of engagement with stakeholders and the administration around the state's policy and alignment, and with the passage of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the work that the team put in, and I need to give credit to Gil Quiniones and his team for the amount of effort that they put in. Let me take a moment to remind you of the steps that were taken leading up to that final order and we were tracking. Leading up to January 2023 filing, Shar, we participated in 15 ICC-led workshops with hundreds of participants.\nWe responded to more than 10,000 data requests during that 11-month rate process, and we ended up with a proposed order that granted almost 80%, 79% or so of our revenue requirement asked, with only a $350 million gap in rate base or about 2% by 2027. But part of that process with all those stakeholders, the one group that we hadn't heard from was the Illinois Commerce Commissioners themselves. Well, now we have. And our job is to align with what they are requesting. And we jumped right back in, as Jeanne outlined, into that stakeholder process. Gil and his team are meeting on a regular basis with those stakeholders to lay it out and to meet the objectives that CEJA requires and what the commissioners want. And they outlined affordability, reliability, which are common goals. Now it's just a matter of how do we get there?\nSo to your question, what confidence do we have? We are building a plan to achieve those goals, and we will continue to talk with those stakeholders. But as Jeanne also laid out, we are ready to pivot if required. What I can tell you with assurance is that this 5% to 7% earnings growth is premised on multiple outcomes. We're taking those things into consideration, and we'll be able to make those adjustments. But we're going to put together, and are putting together, a plan to meet all of those objectives. But let me just be very clear. Our priorities are the following: provide safe and reliable electricity for the citizens of Illinois, and maintain a healthy, financially strong company. In that partnership, we think we can achieve there. We can achieve those goals. And we don't believe those goals are any different than the Illinois Commerce Commission.\nWe've heard their voice, and now we're leaning into that discussion. Jeanne, anything you'd like to add?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And I think I'll address Shar's second point or second part of that question. So 2024, to your point, Shar, we've provided a guidance range with a midpoint that assumes the 14 December 2023 order. We have the rehearing process going on, which is about an interim revenue requirement while the Grid Plan is being approved. And then we have the Grid Plan process, which will kick off when we file that on 13 March 2024. Depending on those outcomes, there could be upside to the 2024 if we get an interim revenue requirement or a Grid Plan approved. But the midpoint assumes the December order. Now, beyond 2024, we did approve that the—or sorry, we did assume that the Grid Plan would be approved.\nIt is a Grid Plan that, as Calvin mentioned, is focused on safe, reliable operations and alignment on the progress in CEJA. It's lower, right? We're not going to be able to make as much progress on CEJA just given the unfavorable economics. But we do want to make progress, and we will. Now, there is not a set timeline for the commission to opine on the Grid Plan, but we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are optimistic it gets done this year. The commission stated that in their order in December, that they understand the sense of urgency. And so while it does assume that the Grid Plan is approved 2025 to 2027, we are prepared, if we cannot get alignment, to make further reductions and still deliver.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys. Let me leave it at, no, I appreciate it. Let me leave it at that. Thank you, guys.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question goes in the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning, Nick.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for—hey, good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess just to kind of clarify on the CapEx plan, I mean, the plan's $3 billion and change higher, to your point. I guess your 2026 rate base does seem like it is lower, though, plan over plan. So I guess, could you just help us kind of clarify what's maybe driving that? I know there's probably some moving pieces in the starting point for ComEd rate base, but yeah.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nJeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's really the difference between the distribution, so pulling back on the distribution investments and then replacing it with transmission. We talked about it in the prepared remarks.\nThere's kind of two slices of it. There's the awards we've been talking about, the Brandon Shores and the RTEP Window, where those projects will close in 2028, and at the end of 2028 for Brandon Shores and then 2030 for the RTEP Window. So those will go into rate base outside of the planning period. So as we move distribution out and layer those in, you're not seeing the one-for-one offset in rate base. We do have other transmission that'll close within the period, but it is back-loaded. As you know, right, transmission doesn't have, even if it's closed within that year, right, it doesn't have the same impact as distribution. So it's really just the shift that we made from [inaudible].\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. I appreciate that.\nAnd then, I guess maybe you can help us understand on the financing, really not much equity to do in 2024. Just where does your balance sheet stand for 2024 relative to the agency minimums? And just what's the feedback been from the agencies on this new plan and kind of maintaining the stable outlook? Thanks.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. Yeah. No problem. So I think the message is consistent with how we talked about it last year. So we had said over the planning period, we expect to be at 100 basis points of cushion absent CAMT. And if we get the corporate alternative tax alleviated, we'd be back into sort of the middle of that range. Obviously, a couple of things happened since we've last spoken. First, the ComEd order. And with that order, we did see an impact to our balance sheet.\nWe then mitigated that impact largely, not one-for-one, but we had a substantial mitigation through the reduction of the distribution spend, as well as O&M reductions, and looking at pension contributions and other things. We kind of pulled all the things we could to make sure we got back up and mitigated as much as we could a large portion of that ComEd order. The other piece was layering in the new capital. As we layered in that new capital and funding it with about 40% equity, we were able to kind of maintain that cushion that we wanted, right, that 100 basis points. Now, if you think about it from a year-over-year perspective, as we've also talked about in the past, I think we expect the front end of the plan to be a little bit lower, particularly on the Moody's side, still above the threshold.\nBut lower in 2024 and getting better over the planning period, mostly due to some of the cash recovery regulatory mechanisms like the formula rate true-up for 2023 that'll come in 2025. And then so that kind of—that's why we show you that average. But at the average of 13%, and then again, I would say the impact of the equity starts to sort of build on itself. And so as you get to the back end of the planning period and beyond, that is helpful in terms of continuing to bolster that cushion. But then also, as those transmission projects close, the cash flows, they are also beneficial to the metrics. And again, I'll—yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Dick.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman from Wolfe Research.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Good morning.\nSo, just, I know you're engaging with a lot of the parties, as you said, in Illinois. Just, is there any chance you could settle some of these issues, or do we need to just let the commission kind of rule on everything? And is there any, beyond just the order they gave, is there any opportunity to get a better sense from them, the commission level, what they want, or are we just going to have to kind of wait for a final order again?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. No. Thank you, Steve. I'll start with this, and then I have with me Gil Quiniones, who's the CEO of ComEd, to really weigh in here as well. My view on the settlement, as I mentioned, Gil and his team are engaged with the stakeholders.\nWe may reach some settlement and discussions with stakeholders about what they're looking for, and we would submit it to the commission. But I think overall, a settlement in principle on the rate case, I think, is unlikely. The process will continue to play out. The fact that we are in the midst of a pending proceeding, we cannot speak directly, nor should we, with the commissioners themselves. Our view of where they stand came in the form of their 14 December order, and we have a clear understanding. But what we can do, and what we are doing, is engaging with staff, consistently talking again as we did for the last two years. We're back re-engaged in that process.\nAnd what we are providing them and sharing with them, and then I'll turn it over to Gil, is under the tenets of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the need to align policy and practice, what the law says, and what we need to do to carry it out, seeks some alignment between the legislative body and the commission to accomplish the shared goals of all of us. And that is our conversation from day one, and that will continue to be based on the feedback that they've given. Gil, anything you'd like to add?\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nCEO, ComEd\n\nYeah. Calvin and Steve, what's different now is that it's very clear in the final order what they identified as things that complied with the law and things that the commission thinks there are gaps. So one by one, we are making sure that we're addressing those gaps in the final order.\nSecond, as Calvin said, we're working very closely with staff and each of the intervenors in this case to make sure that we have alignment. In some cases, some intervenors have very specific areas that they would like for us to address. And as Calvin said, in those cases, we may have alignment where we can stipulate in our testimony that we have arrived at an agreement with those specific issues. So we're making sure that we are addressing what the final order said, where the gaps are. We're working very closely with staff to make sure we have alignment with them. And then we're working with each of the intervenors in the case for their very specific issues that they want included in our Grid Plan.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey, Julien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Good morning, team.\nHey. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Just wanted to follow up real quickly on some of the next cash questions real quickly. Can you guys comment a little bit? I mean, FFO looking through the four-year window here a little bit better than the prior plan. And that's in spite of, obviously, some of the rate-based dynamics, etc. But it looks like a 2 billion bump to CFO there helps the balance sheet a bit. Can you talk about that a little bit further here? And then also maybe, if you can, to elaborate on some of the earlier questions. I mean, where are you guys overall within the plan?\nI know you articulate here, given years up and down, but overall, are you in the lower end or the midpoint, if you will, of the updated EPS?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nSo let me take the last part first, and then I'll turn it over to Jeanne. So as we talk about the 5% to 7% earnings growth, we are committed to midpoint or better. And I think Jeanne even referenced at least, right? So this is a plan that we've put together that's very prudent in our ability to achieve it. And we've demonstrated as an organization, we can take on headwind and continue to meet the target. As I said, Julien, so proud of the team and the commitments made and commitments kept, right? And we will continue to do that. You think about what we had to overcome in 2023 to deliver an excess of our midpoint to $2.38.\nSo that's the commitment there. I'll let Jeanne talk about the additional equity and balance sheet and so forth.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. The only thing I'd say, we do also continue to show you, Julien, the year-by-year, which gets you to that midpoint or better. So again, there will still be some years above the range, years within the range, all within the range, but some different points to get you to that midpoint or better, as Calvin mentioned. That slide continues in the deck. On the balance sheet, I guess I would characterize a little bit different. I think we're consistent with where we were. So we had expected to be at the 100 basis points of cushion. We expect to continue to maintain that 100 basis points. We largely mitigated the ComEd order through our own internal levers.\nAnd then as we layered in the capital to maintain that cushion, we funded it in a balanced way by layering in that 40% of every new dollar as equity.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. And through the plan, you're assuming consistent authorized equity ratios and returns to get to that midpoint or better?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nWe are assuming the authorized, yep, for each of the jurisdictions on the cap structure.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nCap structure and ROE rate. Yep. Indeed. Excellent. Well, I will leave it there, guys. Thank you very much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nHey. Good morning, Ross.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGood morning, Calvin. Good morning, Jeanne.\nSo I want to acknowledge before I ask my question that there is upside to the Illinois process, but I wanted to spend a minute on, Jeanne, I think what you talked about is the downside to the forecast and the risks in Illinois versus the plan. You did a great job mitigating some of that today with the transmission CapEx to replace sort of the distribution CapEx. But that was a lot of brownfield transmission that we've been talking about for a while. And even that is sort of back-loaded in the forecast, and greenfield would presumably take even longer. So maybe you can continue to do that if there's downside to distribution CapEx at ComEd and the plan. But what are the other levers that you could pull here? Is that lower equity as CapEx declines? Is that lower O&M?\nHow do I think about what levers you have at your disposal to sort of offset that downside risk should that be the outcome in Illinois?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah. I think a couple of parts there. I would say one, every plan that we put forth always prudently includes some sort of, for lack of a better word, cushion, right? So we've got a bunch of scenarios that we're modeling, and we're making sure that we can deliver regardless of where the final Grid Plan comes out. I would say at the lower ROEs, right, it takes a lot of capital at ComEd to make it on the distribution side to make it meaningful impact up or down. And we're prepared to pull back if we need to. And to your point, then, that could have further impacts from financing, savings, and other things.\nObviously, we would always look for O&M levers as well, as we have done in the past. I would say a portion of the transmission that we added, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, was not what we had talked about. It was new opportunities that we had on the list at ComEd related to the high-density localized low growth there on the data centers, continuing to modernize that portion of the grid. So these are needs that need to be addressed on our system. The other thing I would say is, as we talked about before, while we had the two opportunities that we mentioned, we continue to see where we operate in our jurisdiction's potential for further transmission related to interconnection of offshore wind, whether it's the Maryland executive orders, the New Jersey executive orders.\nAs those projects are built, given our footprint, we stand to be competitive for that. So I think there's other opportunities that exist. And the plan reflects both the upside from continuing to execute on the Grid Plan, but also the ability to pull back. We also don't assume any of the performance metrics, right? I think we're going to make sure our Grid Plan is also set up to be able to capture some of those. Obviously, that's a metric, but we're going to work real hard to get some of that, and that's not included in the plan either.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. And if I can just add, Ross, I think what's critical, what Jeanne said, is that understanding Illinois is just one of our many jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWhat we continue to demonstrate in terms of the value of Exelon is our scale, size, and the jurisdictions and the opportunities that exist across our platform. We always talk about the power of the platform, and you saw it flexed in 2023, and you'll see it flexed over our long-range plan from 2024 to 2027. So Illinois is a focal area, and as I shared with you, it's a priority for all of us. I know Gil and his team are fixed on it, but we have other businesses that we will continue to run and, as always, manage our costs, and to ensure that we do it in a very pragmatic basis. Thank you for the question.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nSure thing, Calvin. Absolutely. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGigi. Thank you very much. And more importantly, thank you to everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you in 2024. And as committed for the upcoming spring conferences, Jeanne and I and Andy and the IR team will be on the road. They promised me that we'd be doing that. So thank you. And I look forward to engaging with all of you. But more importantly, I just want to say to the 19,500 employees here at Exelon, thank you for everything that you guys do each and every day. So proud of the performance that we delivered in 2023, and I know we're just getting started. So with that, Gigi, that concludes today's call.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."

The floor is yours.\n\nAndrew Plenge\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Exelon\n\nThank you Gigi and good morning everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 Q3 earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release, and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on slide two of today's presentation or on our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings, and other non-GAAP measures.\nReconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you listening to our Q3 earnings call. Despite a historically mild first nine months of the year and pressures from storms in August and September, we delivered earnings right in line with the expectations laid out in our last earnings call for the quarter. As you can see on slide four, we earned $0.70 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.67 per share on a non-GAAP basis. With the critical summer season behind us, we have narrowed our guidance range to $2.32 to 2.40 per share for 2023. Jeanne will talk more about our results for the quarter and expected financial performance for the balance of the year.\nOperational performance across the platform remained very strong in the Q3 with storms that brought 110-mph wind gusts and 29 major event days that impacted almost 1.3 million customers. We not only kept our financial plan on track, but we also continued our track record of top-quartile reliability performance, and we continue to make progress in safety and customer satisfaction. The Q3 also brought continued execution of key milestones, our six active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia. Beginning with ComEd, we received a proposed order from the ALJ on its multi-year rate and grid plans on 23 October.\nWe're encouraged that the proposed order recognizes that meeting the ambitious electrification and decarbonization goals set by Illinois's groundbreaking Climate and Equitable Jobs Act will require ComEd to make significant investments, and it largely follows an investment plan that has alignment across a broad group of stakeholders. But the order does not recognize a fair cost of financing that investment. It provides a return on equity that is well below the national average. It does not recognize the significant investment we have made in our pension, which supports ComEd's employees and has saved customers almost $1 billion to date with its returns and continues to generate savings for our customers. And it does not allow for a prudent capitalization of the business as it caps equity ratios below an appropriate level.\nSo we are disappointed with elements of the proposed order, but we expect the Commission will consider the full record developed when writing its final order and we continue to make our case with stakeholders. As a reminder, we expect to receive the final order in mid-December as it pertains to BGE. All parties have filed their briefs and we now await a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission, expected on 14 December. We have put forward a strong investment plan to address the needs of our customers that is aligned with the state's ambitious goals to advance the energy transformation. We remain optimistic that the Commission will reach a constructive outcome that appropriately supports our customers and the state goals laid out in the Climate Solutions Now Act.\nAs you will hear from Jeanne, we also made progress in the Atlantic City Electric rate case where a stipulation of settlement awaits final approval. The Delmarva Power and Light electric rate case is progressing as well. Along with the Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland multi-year rate plans, on our longer-term outlook, we continue to reaffirm our existing guides. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. The capital we are investing across our jurisdictions to support the needs of our customers in their energy transformation is what drives that growth. On Tuesday, PJM selected project proposals submitted for the competitive transmission proposal window.\nExelon's proposed transmission projects were among a set of solutions to maintain reliability in the Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia areas driven by significant load increases in Northern Virginia. Specifically, PJM has recommended a suite of solutions that include a scope of work for Exelon that is estimated to cost approximately $850 million with portions assigned to BGE, PECO, Pepco, and Delmarva Power. As this spend is weighted toward the back end of the decade with expected completion dates of 2029 and 2030 that extend beyond the current guidance range, it provides another good indication of the trends in place and degree of work that the grid will require well into the future. I'll also note two additional exciting developments this quarter that support our jurisdiction's energy goals. First, ComEd, PECO, and Pepco were part of two coalitions receiving Hydrogen Hub awards in our service territories.\nThese projects will go a long way toward accelerating access to clean and affordable hydrogen to meet the nation's ambitious carbon reduction goals and creating thousands of clean energy jobs in Exelon service territories. Second, the US Department of Energy recommended two of Exelon's submissions in the Grid Resiliency and Innovation Partnership Program for negotiation of a final award totaling $150 million across our ComEd and PECO utilities. ComEd will direct its $50 million award to enable customers and partners to deploy next generation technologies for growing solar installations and electric vehicles, and PECO is leveraging its $100 million award to enhance resiliency and in vulnerable areas of PECO service territory that are susceptible to severe weather events.\nWhen combined with the middle mile grants that BGE and ComEd were awarded by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Exelon utilities are approaching $200 million in total of federally funded IIJA grant awards this year, not to mention the amounts directed towards its jurisdictions through vehicles like the EPA's Clean School Bus program.\nThe federal support is critical to supporting an affordable and equitable transition. The need for transmission expansion, the investment in new energy supply, and the ever-increasing need for a more resilient grid all highlight the impact that an economy that is increasingly dependent on electricity will have on our investment plan.\nThe energy transformation will last decades, not years, which is why we're confident that investment opportunities will continue to strengthen and lengthen our rate base growth. We look forward to incorporating these updates into our annual financial update on the Q4 earnings call next February. I'll now speak to our operating performance in the Q3 on Slide five.\nReliability remains outstanding. All four utility operating companies had top quartile performance in both reduced outage frequency and shortened outage duration. ComEd operated in the top decile for both metrics. In fact, ComEd and PHI again achieved best on record outage frequency and duration performance, which makes for the Q3 in a row for those two operating companies. Performance like this is particularly impressive when you consider the level of storm activity we experienced this quarter, which is a testament to the investments we're making in the system and the talented, dedicated employees working the system. As an example, in just one damaging storm, BGE crews replaced 32 miles of wire and 82 transformers and they did it 36 hours faster than historical models predicted was possible.\nThat commitment to operational excellence across the Exelon franchise is a key part of what makes us who we are, and our gas operations are keeping pace. All three gas utility operating companies again continue to perform at top decile levels for gas odor response and, as it pertains to customer satisfaction, while three of our utility operating companies continue to benchmark in the second quartile. PECO has progressed to the first quartile. Our improved benchmarking performance at PECO reflects the benefits of those efforts, and all utility operating companies did see increases in their scores. But as we have mentioned, overall satisfaction has been affected by inflation and sunsetting pandemic era relief relevant to the benchmark year. The headwinds facing our customers are real, which is why we are focused on ensuring customers are aware of their options to manage their energy use and reduce their bills.\nWe look to build on increasing satisfaction levels into 2024. Last, we saw improvement in our safety performance benchmark at PHI versus Q2. We continue to focus on the areas of underperformance and implement utility specific action plans to address the higher OSHA rates. And you can see that with PHI scores where our efforts to reinforce procedures, situational awareness, and crew communication has yielded results, and we are also continuing in partnership with the industry to drive a more sophisticated discussion and set up tools around safety to focus employees on which behaviors will most impactfully improve safety and ensure we do our most important job, making sure each employee returns home safely after every shift. I assure you that we will continue to push for excellence across all areas of our operations as we close out 2023.\nI will now turn it to Jeanne to review our financial performance and regulatory.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nUpdates. Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our Q3 financial update along with the outlook for the balance of 2023, and our progress on the 2023 rate case schedule. I will also highlight a recently completed transmission rebuild project by Delmarva Power and Light, designed to further improve reliability for our customers in Eastern Maryland. Starting on slide six, we show our quarter over quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.67 per share in the Q3 of 2023 versus $0.75 in the Q3 of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.08 per share over the same period. Results of $0.67 in the Q3 represent 28% of our expected full year earnings, which is right in line with the expectations provided on the prior earnings call.\nEarnings are lower in Q3 relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.07 from the impact of weather and storms and summer activity returning to normal, and $0.234 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities, and $0.03 of O&M tax and distribution formula rate timing expected to reverse in Q4. This was partially offset by $0.05 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments net of depreciation, as well as $0.01 of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd.\nDespite the summer storms and mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions, we have delivered year-to-date earnings each quarter in line with indications, and we continue to offset the weather headwinds with a combination of O and M levers across the platform. Higher treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE, favorable depreciation at PECO, and the full-year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the ComEd regulatory asset balance. With 1/4 remaining in the year, we are narrowing our 2023 EPS guidance range to $2.32 to 2.40 per share from $2.30 to 2.42 per share.\nOur full year guidance accounts for the absence of proactive de-risking that occurred in Q4 2022, the reversal of year to date O and M tax and distribution formula rate timing, and the anticipated one-time impact in December of BGE's reconciliation for the 2021 and 2022 under-recovery through continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers, along with managing work plans across the platform. We remain on track to deliver earnings within expectations. Recall, our goal is always to achieve the midpoint or better of the guidance range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021 and 2022 guidance midpoints through 2025 and 2026 respectively. Again, our expectation is to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.\nTurning to Slide seven as Calvin mentioned, we continued to execute in all six open distribution rate case proceedings this quarter in line with the established procedural schedule. Each rate case remains on track and we are approaching the final key milestones in December for ComEd's and BGE's multi-year rate plan rate cases. Let me begin with key developments since the last call. First, DPL Delaware received intermediate testimony and filed a rebuttal supporting the key elements of the company's proposed electric distribution revenue requirement increase of $39.3 million. DPL Delaware will continue to establish that the proposed plan is necessary to continue providing safe and reliable service, meet customer expectations, and support Delaware's clean energy goals while balancing customer affordability. A final order is expected in Q2 2024.\nSecond, we are pleased with the progress in Atlantic City Electric's distribution rate case with the stipulation of settlement in place. The procedural schedule was suspended in early September. On 21 October, ACE filed a stipulation of settlement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and on 24 October, the administrative law judge presiding over the case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. ACE anticipates final approval of the settlement from the BPU in Q4. Next, the procedural schedule in Pepco's DC multi-year rate plan filing has been adjusted to accommodate the Commission's request for supplemental testimony from Pepco. Similar to the Commission's request from its first multi-year plan, this directive provides Pepco the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits afforded by multi-year rate plans relative to traditional ratemaking.\nPepco now expects to receive intervener testimony on 11 December 2024 and evidentiary hearings will take place in March 2024, with a final order expected from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia by mid-2024.\nWhile still in the discovery phase of its second multi-year rate plan filing, Pepco Maryland continues to detail for interested stakeholders its proposed investment plan designed to advance the state's climate and clean energy goals. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the Maryland Public Service Commission staff on 15 December, and evidentiary hearing set to begin in March 2024. Briefs will be filed in April 2024, and we expect a final order by June 2024. Additionally, in Maryland, evidentiary hearings were conducted and briefs filed in September and October respectively, as part of BGE's pending multi-year electric and gas rate case. The hearings allowed parties to share perspectives on the proposed investments, their alignment with the goals of the state, and how best to balance the state's goals around the energy transformation, affordability, and customers' interests.\nAs expected, the Maryland Commission continues to prioritize safety, reliability, and affordability, and it is also focused on addressing the goals of the Climate Solutions Now Act. We continue to believe BGE's proposed investment plans are well suited for Maryland to meet its aggressive clean energy goals in an affordable manner. The proceeding is expected to run its full course with the final order expected from the commission by 14 December.\nMoving on to ComEd's multi-year rate plan proceeding, as you heard from Calvin, the administrative law judges presiding over the case issued a proposed order on 23 October. While the ALJ proposed order recognizes that ComEd must undertake significant infrastructure investments to meet the state's clean energy goals, it does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate environment. We continue to believe the evidence on record supports ComEd's requests on ROE, capital structure, and a return on its pension assets, among other factors, to provide a clear path in achieving a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities in Illinois. But while we are disappointed in the proposal, let me remind you that this is just another data point in the process and is non-binding on the Commission.\nGiven the number of variables at play in the transition to a multi-year plan, our current plan contemplates a range of fair and reasonable scenarios in the final order to achieve the State's aggressive decarbonization and electrification.\nWe look forward to the remaining steps in the process, including filing briefs on exception by 8 November, reply briefs on exception by 20 November, and participating in oral arguments which we anticipate will occur in late November. Each of these avenues will provide ComEd the opportunity to demonstrate the facts on key elements that are supported on the record and advocate for our positions which we continue to believe are in the best interest of customers and aligned with the State's energy policy goals. A final order is expected at the last scheduled ICC meeting of the year on 14 December, but due no later than 20 December. Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive and we remain steadfast in our engagement with key stakeholders across the regulatory bodies, the state legislators, and the communities to support our shared interests in the energy transformation.\nAs a reminder, by next year we expect to have resolution on all four of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland, and D.C., which will support their respective clean energy and climate goals while balancing customer affordability and equity. More details on the rate cases can be found in slides 20 to 26 of the appendix. Moving to slide eight, during Q3 we continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to invest $7.2 billion expected for 2023. These investments are designed to deliver answers to an expanding set of needs for tomorrow's grid, enhance customer value, adapt to climate change, meet heightened resilience and reliability challenges, and modernize outmoded systems and equipment. Just to mention a few, these investments also support our communities.\nToday, I specifically would like to highlight how Delmarva Power's recently completed East New Market to Cambridge Transmission Upgrade project in Maryland is meeting those.\nConstruction to rebuild the transmission equipment began in late fall of 2021. This $40 million project included upgrading more than 11mi of existing transmission line with new wire and installing 189 galvanized steel poles. Replacing wood poles with new, longer-lasting steel utility poles strengthens the local energy grid and reduces the number of transmission poles along the road. These more reliable structures are also designed to withstand severe weather conditions, a vital design element as climate change has contributed to the increased intensity of coastal storms. For perspective, steel poles can withstand 120mph hurricane-force winds and blizzard conditions, an increase of up to 20% compared to wood poles. Together, these important upgrades, which were placed in service in May 2023, are expected to help prevent outages and enhance overall reliability for more than 13,000 residents of Dorchester County, Maryland.\nProjects such as this transmission rebuild contributed to the nearly 30% decrease in electric outage frequency our DPL Maryland customers have experienced over the last five years. The East New Market to Cambridge project is just one example of our broader strategic effort to strengthen and modernize the energy grid across all of our service areas. We continue to see significant need for transmission investments to support state and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification. This demand supplements more traditional transmission expansion needs, including congestion relief, operational performance requirements, infrastructure resilience, equipment, material condition, and customer service. As Calvin mentioned, we look forward to providing our annual financial update inclusive of the newly awarded transmission upgrade spend from PJM as well as the final rate orders in Illinois and Maryland on the fourth quarter earnings call in February 2024.\nI will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide nine. As a reminder, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P and Moody's investment-grade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or at the lower end of that range. While our plan incorporates the assumption that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not allow for repairs, we remain optimistic that it will be implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact.\nWe continue to anticipate the Treasury will issue more guidance on the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax before year-end. From a financing perspective, I will remind you that we completed all our planned debt financing needs for 2023 as of the second quarter call, reducing earnings volatility in the second half of the year. In managing the interest rate volatility, we continue the pre-issuance hedging and floating rate cap programs that were initiated last year. In addition, we continuously monitor the capital markets and regularly assess our plans for future issuance, timing, sizing, tenor, and tranching strategy to ensure we always achieve optimal outcomes. Additional detail on our earnings sensitivities reflective of our hedging activity to date is provided on slide 18 in the appendix. Lastly, there have been no changes in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by 2025.\nAs we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment at the utilities, including those assigned by PJM, we will continue and ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet consistent with the expectations of a premium T&D company while supporting our 68% annualized earnings growth rate. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing Remarks\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Jeanne. With just a couple of months left to go in 2023, I'll conclude with a reminder of our goals and priorities for the year. First, our foundation is Operational Excellence, which benefits our customers and communities. As I mentioned, our employees rose to the challenge as they always do for our summer storms, but we're ready to close out the year strong to prove we have the best operators in the business. Indeed, PA Consulting just awarded ComEd with its 2022 ReliabilityOne National Reliability Award, one of the most prestigious honors in the electric utility industry, recognizing it for sustained leadership, innovation, and achievement in the area of electric reliability. This award highlights the value of a committed operating team executing on a sophisticated operating plan and investment strategy and provide its customers the grid that they deserve.\nI now want to take a moment to just recognize Terry Donnelly, COO of ComEd. Terry will be retiring at the end of this year after almost 12 years in that position. Terry, just thank you for his continued steadfast leadership and also the selection between him and Gil Quinones of David Perez, who is stepping in as a longtime Senior VP into the role of Chief Operating Officer. We have high expectations of David that they will continue to deliver on the operational performance that Illinois customers have come to expect. We are also focused on completing a number of the rate cases we have underway, including BGE's multi-year plan for its gas and electric systems as well as ComEd's multi-year rate and grid investment plans.\nWe continue to believe that parties in both cases have a shared interest in reaching outcomes that align with the state's energy policy and equity goals while ensuring we have the certainty and confidence to make the investments needed to serve our customers reliably. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act was passed in 2021 with the promise of making Illinois a leader in the energy transformation. The approval of these first electric multi-year plans are a key moment for the state to advance its clean energy goals and follow the truly ambitious plan and process the state laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. We are optimistic that the State of Illinois will seize the opportunity. Third, we will finish out the year meeting our financial guidance.\nNarrowing our guidance range to $2.32 to 2.40 per share demonstrates the confidence we have in executing despite the historically mild weather this year, and we remain on track to invest $7.2 billion of capital and earn consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range. Lastly, we never want to lose sight of our responsibility to our customers and communities as the premier transmission distribution utility. Just this past quarter, ComEd and PECO were two of only six utilities to partner with local governments and community-based groups to win DOE support from its Clean Energy to Communities program. Through this program, ComEd will help explore low-carbon transportation technologies for Chicago like freight travel electrification, while PECO will assist in creating a regional hub to streamline procurement of the most impactful clean energy technologies for the Delaware Valley region.\nBGE awarded grants to 41 nonprofit organizations in Maryland to support environmental stewardship programs, and Pepco energized the first of three substations as part of its Capital Grid project, which is Pepco's forward-looking plan to upgrade or add substations and underground transmission cable to modernize and strengthen our nation's capital's grid. In doing so, Pepco was able to provide $29 million to local suppliers and $30 million to diverse suppliers as part of the work to complete that substation. Those examples show whether it's providing direct support to our customers, our community organizations, facilitating access to support from federal or national organizations, or ensuring our work on the grid benefits our jurisdictions end-to-end, the Exelon team is focused on ensuring all of its actions are intentional in serving the greater purpose of leading the energy transformation.\nThese goals are what make for a premier T&D utility, one that embraces the opportunity to lead the energy transformation, partners with its jurisdictions to achieve their goals, uplifts its communities, and meets the expectations laid out for the investment community, offering a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Thank you as always for your interest. I'll now turn it to Gigi for your Questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press Star one one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey guys, good morning, how are you? Thank.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning James.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Good morning. So starting off I guess with the ALJ order in Illinois, Calvin, you mentioned your expectations that the Commission will consider the full record, I guess as they draft the final order. And I realize you've been in a formula construct for a while, but is there any prior precedent for the ICC to make those kind of departures from the ALJ? Just trying to understand the prospects here for provision and your confidence.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah. First off, James, thank you for your question. And there is precedent. The record is going to be considered by the full commission, but the commission definitely has leeway to look at the record separately, taking into advisement what the ALJ has said. But also keep in mind this is the first time that this commission has come together under multi-year rate plan and grid plan to consider how ComEd's proposals meet the state's goals. So I do. They do know there's a difference in opinion on how to approach this. And I think they will take that all in consideration because we have three new commissioners, Gil, and they will lean into this discussion and look at what they need to do to achieve the state's goals, which are very specific. And I have Gil Quinones, the CEO, comment with me.\nGil, anything you'd like to add?\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nCEO, ComEd\n\nYeah, I think it's also important to note that this is really.\nYou know, it's a key milestone in the process. But there are four other key milestones coming up, as both Calvin and Jeanne mentioned: the briefs to the commission and exceptions, replies to those briefs, and oral arguments before the final order. As Calvin said, we feel strong conviction that the evidence on record supports ComEd's request. Based on what the commissioners have done in the past, we anticipate that they will make adjustments and corrections before they issue a final order. We expect the Commission will not only consider the proposed order, but the entirety of the record in the case and the policies of the State. It is an historic once in a lifetime opportunity, and we believe the Commission will meet the moment in advancing the ambitious goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act and the state's economic development aspirations.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you, Gil. Did that answer your question? James?\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nIt did. Thank you. Then just maybe one for Jeanne, just on the remaining equity need in the current plan. I guess if you don't get the minimum tax clarity you're looking for from the IRS, would you need to accelerate the need into 2024 or does 2025 mean 2025? Just any additional color on timing\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, no. Everything we've given you assumes that we pay the corporate alternative minimum tax. And so regardless of how that turns out, our commitment is to do the 425 between now and 2025. So that doesn't change regardless of the outcome.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThere. Okay, thanks. And then just real quickly, the transmission spend today, that is purely incremental to the 870 you debuted on the last call related to Brandon Shores.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nRight? Yeah. They're two similar numbers, but two different projects.\n\nJames Kennedy\n\nVP, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thank you,\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nthank you,\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGood morning David\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Hey, Calvin. Hey, Jeanne, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe on that same topic, with the transmission projects that PJM has selected, could you elaborate a bit on which year the CapEx would start to flow into the spending plan? And also, just as you think about PJM and potential competitive opportunities going forward, are there future opportunities that you plan to bid into?Also?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nDavid, I'll start, but then I'll turn it over to David Velasquez who's here with me that has our transmission strategy group reporting up to him and working with all the opcos. I believe our transmission build out has tremendous opportunity to not only strengthen what we're doing, but also lengthen our earnings growth and doing it in a way that ensures not only reliability but the ability to connect renewables to the grid. David and his team have put together a robust plan, and I'll let him take a moment to walk you through.\n\nDavid Velasquez\n\nSVP Transmission Strategy, Exelon\n\nSo Dave on the transmission project, I'd like to give you a sense. You know we have Brandon Shores, which was the project we talked about last quarter, you know, which has an in-service date in the end of 2028. So you think about cash flows there. And again you have to recognize we're in preliminary engineering yet, so this is liable to move a little bit. But I figure typically like in the last couple years, 2027, 2028, you spent somewhere around 40% to 50% of that expenditure. And then leading up to it, starting next year, you'd slowly ramp into it. In the first three years you'd spend somewhere again between 50% and 60% of the project.\nThe Dominion Energy, which has an in-service date, part of it in 2029, part of it in 2030. I think you'd see a similar profile where, in the last couple years, you'd probably see around 40% to 50% of the expenditures, and in the three or four years leading up to that. So some of this will be within the current period, and some of it will be after the current period. I think on the broader question, as Calvin had said, there's a lot of opportunities out there. We look at every single competitive window that PJM puts out there and make decisions whether we think we can add value for our customers by presenting proposals. We will continue to do that. I think also there's other opportunities out there. Offshore wind is one in Maryland.\nThe commission has to issue a solicitation to help bring on some of the additional megawatts by July of next year. We continue to see a lot of load growth in our regions around data centers. There's also some hydrogen hubs that have been awarded grants from the federal government in our territories. We also continue to see some generation retirements. PJM recently announced retirement of a Wagner unit, large Wagner unit in BGE territory. So there's a lot of different opportunities that we're looking at out there to continue to again for our customers and for the public policy goals, continue to invest in transmission.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. That's really helpful. Thank you for that color. And I guess as you, you know, as you think about some of this incremental upside CapEx, it sounds like some of which would hit the current plan, but then also, you know, looking ahead to the next five-year CapEx plan, how do you think about financing, you know, the next year of kind of higher CapEx growth and rate base growth. Specifically thinking about how you're thinking about equity needs from.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nHere. Yeah. Hey David, it's Jeanne. I think it's how we've always thought about it. You know, when we rolled out the $31 billion on our last call, we talked about financing it in a balanced approach with internal cash flows and a mix of debt and equity. And so I think to the extent we continue to see more and more work, which we know there will be, we'll finance it in a way that maintains that cushion on the balance sheet that we target but also ensures that we meet our 6% to 8% earnings growth.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thanks so much. I appreciate.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nIt. Thank you. David.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nMorning. Paul.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nHey Paul.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Good morning, team. And thank you for laying out all those transmission opportunities. Just as we think about the roll forward, so not the current plan, you've been very clear. But the roll forward with these incremental opportunities. Is there a good way to think about financing those incremental CapEx? Is it kind of like a 50-50 mix or should we be thinking of something Different?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, I think as I mentioned with David's earlier question, we'll do it in a balanced way. I think we've got a lot that we're pulling together here. We've got the really exciting incremental transmission opportunities. We have incremental investments from the new rate cases that we've been filing. So we're going to pull all that together as we always do on the Q4 and give you a full update when all of that is final. We should have some more information again at the end of the year by the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. We'll embed any additional cost savings that we're finding as we continue to get further out of separation.\nSo, as I mentioned, we'll fund any new incremental capital with a mix of internal cash flows reinvesting back into the business, and, to the extent necessary, do what we need to do to make sure we maintain that cushion on the balance sheet, but always also hit our earnings target of 68%. So we'll do it in that balance capital Wise.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, understood. Then shifting topics a little bit, do you have an estimate for what the Illinois ComEd customer bill CAGR is like the next five years for your rate case? Then I know there's the carbon mitigation credit that rolls off. So just curious how the bill trajectory.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, on the ask, I believe it was just somewhere between 4% and 5% on the bill CAGR that was on the ask.\nAnd then the second part of your question was, what was the second part on, as the CMCs roll.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, just overall, like, again, you're only part of the bill, like, what an overall ComEd customer bill trajectory looks like over the next five years.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah, over the next five. Again, on the rate case ask, it was, I think, around 4.55%.\n\nGil Quiniones\n\nCEO, ComEd\n\nBut it's important to note, Paul, that ComEd starts below the national average in terms of overall rates. So as I like to think of the headroom within that utility to invest and move the state forward exists, one because of the carbon mitigation credits, but also because they start from a position of strength in having some of the lowest rates in the country. I think it's roughly 23% below large city national average. That's where ComEd sits in perspective.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, great. Now, thank you both, and thank you Team.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank You.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question. One moment for our next. Our last question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan Securities.LLC.\n\nAiden Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nHey, good morning. This is actually Aiden Kelly on for Jeremy, just one quick question going back to ComEd. I'm curious, how do you reconcile the differences between the ALJ's 9.28% ROE and staff's 8.91% ROE, as well as the proposed equity ratio? And then could you just talk more about where the ultimate return on pension assets debate Stands?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nYeah, I would tell you that as we talked about, I'll first start with one step, and this is just another step in the process as Gil laid out. You know, coming off the World Series, I think we're in the sixth inning, right? We're in the sixth inning of a long game. And that's just, it's one step. Staff was one, and you saw they came in at 8.9% talking about the formula rate. And then we get the ALJ; we were able to respond. Then we get the ALJ's ruling of 9.28%. So we will continue to respond to the evidence as presented and present additional data for this commission to work with. And that includes not only ROE, that includes return on pension assets.\nAs I talked about in my statement, it warrants a return, and we have even come to an agreement with the Attorney General of Illinois where at minimum getting a debt return. So we continue to move forward and present the why. I think that's the powerful part of this, Jeremy, is that when we can articulate the why and frame how it's beneficial for all customers, and having a productive and efficient company that's moving the state's goals, we'll get there. To get into the details of this, of any other pieces this early in the process, I think we'd be inserting ourselves deeper before the full commission has a chance to hear the evidence, as Gil has laid out. We have. When's our next filing, Gil, that we're presenting to them. The briefs on exceptions will be on November 8th. November 8th.\nWe'll lay it out all fully then. Jeremy, on 8 November. As to the what and the. Why.\n\nAiden Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nAppreciate the color there. And then just one quick question, unrelated, on the $425 million equity: would you consider ATM or follow-on?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon\n\nYeah? We have a $1 billion ATM in place, and so we can always just leverage that and kind of dollar-cost average in as needed.\n\nAiden Kelly\n\nEquity Research Associate, J.P. Morgan Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks. I'll leave it there\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nThank you Aiden\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon\n\nGigi, as always, thank you very much, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in a week. Jeanne, the team, and I, we're looking forward to just engaging with you in a more robust and deep manner at that conference. And with that, that concludes our call. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.\n\nAndrew C. Plenge\n\nVP of IR, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 2nd quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they'll be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.\nWe would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin G. Butler\n\nSenior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.\nWe continue delivering on our plan as expected, which is a testament of all of the work put in by our dedicated employees. But before we get into our results and business updates, I'd like to first start by acknowledging a key milestone. In July, ComEd reached the end of the 3-year term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. At the court status hearing, the government moved to dismiss the charge, noting the company fully complied with the DPA, which the court granted in the hearing. We remain committed at all levels of the company to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior, and we look forward to building on the trust of our customers as we continue to move forward.\nIn that spirit, I am pleased to welcome Anna Richo to our Board of Directors. Anna is the General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary for Cargill, and she brings highly complementary experience as an attorney, and business leader. Her commitment to operational excellence and compliance will provide invaluable oversight.\nNow turning to the results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, we earned $0.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.41 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results are right in line with what we expected this quarter, and we remain on track to earn within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. We continue performing operationally at a very high level. Three of our four utilities had best on-record performance in outage frequency and outage duration, which I will touch on more on our next slide.\nWe have also continued to progress through our rate case calendar with 6 active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Most recently, on May 16, we filed our second multiyear plan for Pepco Maryland, the climate ready pathway plan. The filing outlines Pepco's near-term proposal to advance the state's climate and clean energy goals while taking steps to mitigate the impact of these efforts on customers' bills. The proposal includes over $150 million of climate solution programs to help Maryland meet its goals in the areas of transportation electrification, building decarbonization, beneficial electrification and distributed energy integration. It also includes a proposed performance incentive mechanism to focus on reliability, greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal of equipment posing health and environmental risk.\nWe look forward to working through the process with stakeholders and the commission staff toward rates effective in the second quarter of 2024. Beyond Pepco Maryland, we have now received intervenor testimony in our BGE and ComEd multiyear rate plans and filed our rebuttals, and additional milestones await us in those cases in August, along with activity for Delmarva Delaware and Atlantic City Electric. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia has also set its schedule for the Pepco D.C. multiyear plan. You will hear more from Jeanne about all the work underway to align with our regulatory stakeholders.\nNow looking past 2023, we'll also remind you of the guidance we've previously provided on our long-term outlook. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. Over the next 4 years, we anticipate investing over $31 billion to support the energy transformation, which is what's driving that growth. And I'll remind you that we continue finding opportunities to further support the transformation, whether it's increasing affordability for customers or strengthening the durability of our long-term investment plans.\nFor instance, we have talked about our efforts pursuing grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support the investment programs we have laid out for the commissions. And we recently announced winning approximately $30 million of grant funding for middle mile broadband investments at BGE and ComEd. Additionally, you may have also seen that PJM recently voted to proceed with transmission upgrades to address reliability challenges associated with the retirement of the brand insurers coal plant in Eastern Maryland with over $850 million of work assigned to our utilities.\nNow while most of the incremental spend for that investment occurs beyond our current guidance window, it's a great illustration of how we continue to have opportunities to strengthen and lengthen our expected rate base growth as the largest pure T&D utility in the United States. Our transmission upgrades ensure customers are able to buy cleaner generation and that they can depend on a reliable, resilient grid to deliver that power.\nBefore I move on to operations, I want to mention that we published our latest Exelon Sustainability Report in mid-July. This is the 12th report in our company's history. We are incredibly proud of the work our organization puts into ensuring we are leading the energy transformation in an affordable and equitable manner. Our purpose, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and communities, really shines through that report. And the progress we continue to make in fulfilling that purpose is meaningful.\nHere are a few examples. We have connected over 200,000 customers with over 3 gigawatts of renewable energy resources, a 16% increase over 2021. We saved close to 25 million megawatt hours in 2022 with our award-winning energy efficiency programs, a 9% increase that avoided 9.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and saved customers over $30 million at our average retail rate. Our support for diverse suppliers is now up more than 56% from 2018 levels, having spent $2.9 billion with such suppliers in 2022. Additionally, 62% of our $7.5 billion total supplier spend is with companies in the communities we serve.\nOur annual sustainability report illustrates all the ways in which our more than 19,000 employees ensure our communities greatly benefit from the work we are doing to support their energy transformation goals.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on our operating performance for the first half of the year. As it pertains to reliability, we continue setting the bar for performance. All 4 utilities operated in at least the top quartile, and ComEd, PECO and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance. That makes it the second quarter in a row for ComEd and PHI for best on record performance. Those 3 utilities also happen to achieve best on record system outage duration performance, and BGE continues to operate in the top quartile. Their performance illustrates that the investments we are making in the grid provide the footing for this operational excellence. And then it is up to our employees to rise to the challenge of keeping customers online or getting them back online as quickly as possible when outages do occur.\nNow that job is getting harder to do with storms growing more frequent and severe. But it's increasingly important to do as society depends more and more on electricity. Nationally, we expect to see 50% annual growth in electric cars and 12% annual growth in data centers. And ComEd particularly, is already seeing sizable opportunity in data centers. The data center growth will only strengthen as industries increasingly rely on cloud services and AI. As the nation's largest T&D company, we must rise to the challenge of meeting these incremental demands on the grid.\nThis operational performance was matched on the gas side, with all 3 utilities continuing to perform at top decile levels for gas odor response. Our customer satisfaction scores remain in line with those reported in our first quarter call. Our utilities are performing in the second quartile versus the 2021 benchmark when costs across the board were lower, pandemic relief had not yet rolled off and customers had not yet been impacted by the escalating interest rates and commodity prices. We are working every day to ensure customers are aware of the options they have to manage their costs, and we have seen increased engagement by our customers through these efforts.\nIn fact, ComEd announced just 2 weeks ago that it won several recognitions in the 20th Annual Best Practices awards by Chartwell. These annual Chartwell awards recognize excellence among electric and gas utilities with respect to customer-oriented projects, programs and service initiatives. One of these awards included recognition for ComEd's community energy assistance ambassador program. This program originally launched in 2020 in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. It was designed with a community-based organization to increase education and access to financial assistance options that can help income eligible customers pay their electric bills while creating local employment opportunities for the same vulnerable population.\nBut it is a constant reminder of the importance of focusing on value for our customers as well as affordability, and we are continuously seeking to reduce our own operating costs in addition to pursuing the customer-focused initiatives we have discussed.\nI will conclude by discussing our safety performance, where we lost ground at 3 of our 4 utilities. Ensuring our employees and contractors operate in a safe environment is of paramount importance. Lower performance this quarter largely resulted from low-impact OSHA recordables like slips and falls and minor vehicle-related incidents. As a result, each of our operating companies have action plans underway to address areas of needed improvement to ensuring that we are operating at our standards. This includes revisiting our safety plans for the year to ensure they are adequately addressing the issues we have observed year-to-date. Other examples include facility reviews to enhance safety and expanding our simulation-based training to offer more opportunities for employees. We are working hard to drive safety performance to the levels that we expect.\nI will now turn it over to Jeanne to discuss our financial performance and provide additional color on our regulatory activity in the second quarter. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne M. Jones\n\nSVP of Corporate Finance, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update along with the outlook for the second half of 2023, our progress on the 23 rate case schedule, and I'll also highlight an ongoing project that exemplifies our commitment to delivering sustainable value as the premier T&D energy company by modernizing critical infrastructure in the Philadelphia area.\nStarting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2023 versus $0.44 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.03 per share over the same period. Results of $0.41 in the second quarter were right in line with the expectations provided in the prior earnings call. Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO. This was partially offset by $0.03 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments net of depreciation as well as a $0.01 of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd.\nDespite another quarter of mild weather impacting our nondecoupled jurisdictions, we delivered earnings results exactly where we said. Through the first half of 2023, operating earnings are $1.11 per share, reflecting 47% of the projected full year earnings. This is in line with how we performed through the first half of 2022. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect a relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be approximately 28% of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Recall that Q3 2022 saw strong growth from $0.04 of higher rates and effect with PECO's electric rate case in year 1 of its current rate cycle,as well as $0.03 of realized 30-year treasury rate uplift on ComEd's formula rate distribution ROE and another $0.03 of distribution formula rate timing at ComEd.\nWhile the fundamentals underpinning the earnings remaining this year, we expect third quarter '23 results to be lower. Net distribution and transmission growth will be offset by higher interest, and we also expect some [indiscernible] of O&M and taxes. For the fourth quarter of '23, we expect year-over-year earnings growth to benefit from the absence of proactive derisking that occurred in the fourth quarter of '22, the expected reversal of the O&M and tax timing and the anticipated onetime impact of BGE's reconciliation for the '21 and '22 under recovery of its first multiyear plan. As we do not receive the final order on the reconciliation for BGE until December of '23, we cannot record BGE's earnings associated with the reconciliation until that time.\nIn line with discussion on the first quarter earnings call, we expect the $0.07 of unfavorable weather experienced year-to-date to be offset with the combination of O&M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation at PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the CMC regulatory asset balance.\nOn a full year basis, we continue to reaffirm our 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. Through a continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and strong cost control across the platform, we remain on track to deliver earnings at the midpoint or better of our guidance range. With several months of weather and storm exposure remaining, you can expect we'll manage utility work plans to deliver earnings within expectations. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021's and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.\nTurning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front. Since the last earnings call, there was 1 new rate case filed, so I'll provide a status update on each of the 6 current open proceedings, starting with the most recent filing. On May 16, Pepco Maryland submitted its climate ready pathway, a 3-year multiyear plan application to the Maryland Public Service Commission. Pepco is requesting a $213.6 million revenue increase over the April 2024 and to December 2027 period, inclusive of a proposed 9-month extension reflecting an ROE of 10.5%. The filing outlines investments the company expects to make to support a climate-ready grid and enable cleaner energy programs and technologies that support Maryland's goal to reach net zero emissions by 2045.\nAs an example of the $150 million of climate solution programs that Calvin mentioned are included in PepCo's proposed plan, more than half are dedicated to incentive for approximately 10,000 equipment electrification conversions for customers transitioning to cleaner technologies like heat pumps in the building sector. Another key category of spend is dedicated to enhancing reliability, resiliency and grid security through the installation of more modernized equipment that automatically detect system issues, reinforces the grid against more severe weather and protects the grid from potential physical or cyber threats. Overall, these investments are anticipated to inject more than $1.42 billion into the local economy and support more than 11,000 full-time jobs.\nFor the last 3 years, spanning 2020 to 2022, Pepco has reported the best reliability performance of any electric distribution utility in the state of Maryland, a true testament to the company's commitment of powering a cleaner and brighter future for its customers and communities. Equally as important as reliability, Pepco is focused on keeping affordability front and center for our customers. The multiyear plan includes the acceleration of tax benefits to serve as a bill offset as well as efforts to increase participation in energy assistance and energy efficiency programs, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $23 million to Pepco Maryland customers. An order is expected by June of 2024.\nLet me also remind you of the other electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised a revenue request for a $41.8 million increase based on an updated test period in the electric rate case and, as permitted by Delaware law, implemented full proposed rates on July 15 subject to refund. A decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024. Similarly, ACE revised their revenue request for a $93.6 million increase based on an updated test period, with the final order expected in the first quarter of '24. Additionally, after an 8-month receiving, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a 4-year capital tracker at ACE called Powering the Future, which accelerates the portfolio of projects totaling $93 million designed to enhance reliability and resiliency for customers, advance New Jersey's energy master plan goals and sustained economic growth in the region.\nNext, ComEd and BGE surpassed 2 key milestones in their multiyear plan rate cases, having received intervener testimony and filed their rebutals to support the key elements of the company's initial proposals earlier this year. As discussed on prior earnings calls, both plans outline the investments needed to provide essential service to customers while meeting the clean energy and equity goals of their respective states. In both the ComEd and BGE multiyear plan rate cases, [ evidentiary ] hearings are scheduled to begin in late August with briefs to follow before final orders are expected in December. Lastly, Pepco received a procedural schedule from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia in its second multiyear rate plan filing. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the DC Public Service Commission staff on October 16 and evidentiary hearing set to begin in January of 2024 with final briefs in March of 24.\nRelationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, states and communities through every step of the process to reach our shared goals. As Calvin mentioned, by next year, we expect our resolution on all 4 of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland and D.C. and a clear path forward to supporting clean energy and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 26 of the appendix.\nMoving to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion guidance for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation and increasing levels of electrification.\nToday, I'll talk about how PECO is partnering with the community to build a new 6913-kV substation in Philadelphia at the Civic Terminal Yard and neighboring property. PECO's commitment to building for the new civic substation began in 2019. This $130 million project includes installation of insulated switchgear and modifications to 4 69-kV and transmission lines into civic substations that will allow for the retirement of 2 69-kV transmission lines currently running under the [indiscernible] River. The new substation is expected to increase distribution and transmission reliability through the reconfiguration of the lines and increased flood resiliency in the low-lying areas surrounding the substations, where access has been restricted in the past following heavy thunderstorms.\nIt will also enable PECO to relieve low constraints, supply additional capacity to the University City area and better serve critical customers on the west side of the river. Once it's fully energized, which is expected by the second quarter of '24, the civic substation will be PECO's newest and most modern insulated substation. While traditional open-air substation construction would have required 5 to 7 acres of land, the upgraded electrical that meant associated with the insulated substation allows PECO to build on less than a 2-acre plot of land. That represents a 60% to 70% reduction in required land use.\nSince project inception, PECO has partnered with its customers, government agencies and other local utilities to ensure construction of the civic substation has a minimal impact to the city of Philadelphia, the surrounding customers and on the environment, protecting the nearby waterway and riverbank. With vital customers in the area such as the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center, operational excellence is imperative. As an Exelon utility, PECO is ready to deliver it.\nTurning to Slide 9. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. As a reminder, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or the lower end of that range. We continue to await specific guidance on the corporate alternative minimum tax implementation and are hopeful to have resolution by year-end.\nIn the meantime, the Department of Treasury issued a notice granting deferral of estimated tax payments associated with the corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024, which points to the appreciation that more guidance is required for implementation. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised nearly $1.3 billion for BGE and PECO in the second quarter, which completes all of our planned debt financing needs for 2023. The strong investor demand we continue to see for our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform.\nIn line with the last earnings call, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by '25. We'll continue to update you as we make progress on the plan. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin G. Butler\n\nSenior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeanne. I will once again remind the investment community of what we're working to accomplish in 2023. We take great pride in our operational excellence, which our employees dedicate themselves to daily. Summer is when we see some of the most severe weather activity, and our teams embrace the challenge to get customers back online quickly and safely. As we proceed with our work of supporting the energy transformation in our ongoing rate cases, we are very focused on listening to our stakeholders.\nWe want to ensure that we are delivering the right investment plans and the right services to support meeting their energy transformation and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. After this year, much of our path forward for the next several years will be established and clear. The team also understands it must deliver on our financial priorities and guidance. Efficiently investing $7.2 billion of capital and earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range will support meeting our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. and keeping our balance sheet strong.\nAnd finally, we're continuing to look for innovative ways to support our customers and communities end-to-end throughout our business. In partnership with the Exelon Foundation, we are looking to place our next round of investments in the $20 million climate change investment initiative fund or [indiscernible], an innovative way to advance solutions to the challenges brought by climate change, while improving the quality of life for residents of our cities. For this year, 5 companies were selected to receive investments, spanning areas like software analytics to track air quality, nonrecyclable plastic reuse and novel EV charging solutions.\nEvery day, we're reminded that the energy transformation is happening, and we have to be a vital role in it. And we have a talented team that's incredibly excited to play that role. We recently announced that [ Colette Honorable ] will be joining us as our Executive Vice President of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer. As a renowned energy policy leader who brings expertise in areas like clean energy transformation and equable ratemaking, she will be an invaluable addition to our team. And she'll help us build on the strong foundation we already have in place, built by the team that got us here.\nIn particular, I want to recognize Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our business services company, [ Bridget Reading ] who is retiring in September and played an integral role in shaping our organizational commitment to excellence. She also made incredible strides in diversity, equity and inclusion across the wide variety of corporate support groups that she led like IT and supply. Thank you, Bridget, for your leadership.\nOur team's commitment to leading the energy transformation is what makes us the premier transmission and distribution utility, one that lives by its values, supports its communities and offers a uniquely strong expected total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Thank you, as always, for your interest.\nI'll now turn it to Gigi for your questions.",

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 first-quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeanne Jones, Exelon Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. You may have seen that we issued our earnings release this morning. That release, along with the presentation being used for today's call, can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.\nAs a reminder, the earnings release and other matters that we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. You can find in today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings the discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.\nIn addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Both the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release contain information on reconciliations between the GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call, and it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our Q1 earnings call. Our team of 19,000-plus employees have entered this first full year of operations after the separation, excited to lead the energy transformation as a premier T&D utility. It shows in our results. We are delivering our plan on course. I'll start on slide 4, covering our key messages. We delivered strong year-over-year growth in Q1, earning $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.70 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results keep us on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023.\nThis is despite the impact of mild weather, which is a testament to the stability offered by the progressive, largely decoupled rate-making mechanisms in our jurisdictions. Operationally, we had our best on record reliability performance at all four of our utilities, with ComEd continuing to operate in the top decile. As it pertains to our rate cases, we are well underway in a number of jurisdictions, with three new filings initiated since the Q4 earnings call. Building a stronger, smarter, resilient, and cleaner grid requires investment. We are engaging with our stakeholders to align on our shared goals and ensure this investment is compensated fairly, as it is integral to our strategy.\nOn 15 February, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to support investments in infrastructure to maintain safety, reliability, and customer service for our customers. It also includes initial recovery for ACE's Smart Meter deployment, which brings a host of benefits that Jeanne will highlight shortly. BGE filed its second multi-year plan on 17 February, and Pepco, DC, filed its second MYP on 13 April. Both MYP rate cases incorporate investments that enable the energy transformations guided by jurisdictional policy, whether it be the Climate Solutions Now Act in Maryland or DC's transformative energy policies like the DC Climate Action Plan. Finally, Pepco expects to file its second MYP, our final anticipated base rate filing for the year, with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month.\nJeanne will take the time to highlight the next steps across our open rate cases and provide additional details on the regulatory calendar shortly. Now, in working through these rate cases, we have several new commissioners expected across our jurisdictions, including new chairs in place or pending in Illinois, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, and new appointees in Illinois and Maryland. We appreciate the service of the outgoing commissioners and are excited to begin working with the newest members on this next phase of the energy transformation.\nGiven this transformation will be measured in decades, it reinforces the importance of building a shared, forward-looking understanding of priorities and needs across a variety of stakeholders, which is accomplished through transparency and collaboration. This kind of approach supports continuity through the inevitable evolution in legislative and regulatory bodies over time. Lastly, we continue to reaffirm our existing expectations to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges, with dividend growth to match, underpinned by the investments we are making on behalf of customers and earning an annual consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range during that time.\nOur diverse, deconcentrated capital expenditure plan and predictable investment recovery frameworks contribute to the compelling, risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 9% to 11% that we offer investors between our dividend and earnings growth through 2026. Our results are built on an operating philosophy that relentlessly pursues excellence, as is highlighted on the next slide. Slide five reviews our operating performance for the start of 2023. Beginning first with reliability, you can see that our utilities continue to operate at industry-leading levels, both in terms of outage frequency and outage duration.\nBoth ComEd and PHI achieve best on record outage frequency performance, and all four utilities achieve best on record system outage duration performance. Now, consistent with our focus on continually improving operations and customer value, we are now using total system outage time versus average customer outage duration as one of our reliability metrics. This refined metric better ensures we are comprehensively capturing the customer experience on an equitable basis in each of our service territories. This performance is a testament to the hard work that our employees put in each and every day.\nIt also speaks to the effectiveness of the investments in reliability and resiliency that our utilities have made, providing a great foundation as we discuss with our stakeholders the next phase of investments to support their energy transformations. As it pertains to safety, PHI is now operating at top decile levels, and PECO is in the top quartile, both up from the second quartile last year, while BGE improved the second quartile from third quartile. Now, while we are encouraged by the progress we have made on the safety front in the company, we have a safety-focused zero-tolerance culture.\nWe are using targeted training at each of our utilities, such as ergonomics awareness training at ComEd in light of its move down to second quartile, to address the areas driving underperformance. Gas odor response continues its run of top decile performance, with all three utilities performing at world-class levels in 2023. PHI responded to all gas odors in less than an hour, achieving a perfect rating. Lastly, I want to spend a moment talking about customer satisfaction. As you can see, our four utilities are operating in the second quartile after three out of the four closed out 2022 in top quartile.\nWhile each operating company has unique areas to address, there are a few common trends. For instance, the bar for communicating with customers around outages and reliability continues to be raised. As our customers increasingly rely on the grid, whether it be working remotely or charging their cars, they need access to information in real-time. We are excited about the investments we have made in the tools they already have at their disposal, such as mobile apps, and we will continue to invest in enhancements focused on improving communications.\nAlthough another area of focus is new technology through upgrades to our customer care and billing software, these investments will allow us to provide more options to meet customer needs around billing and other services, and enhance self-service options for those experiencing slower turnaround times. But perhaps the primary driver of lower customer satisfaction scores relative to the latest available benchmark as of 2021 is one that is not unique to Exelon. While the inflationary environment has shown signs of abating recently, particularly around energy supply costs that are a pass-through for us, customers have been impacted by increased costs in many aspects of their lives and businesses.\nThat's why we will continue to focus on maintaining lower-than-average rates and overall bill levels. Again, rates in our cities are 23% below the average rate in the largest cities in the United States, and we have connected customers to increasing amounts of assistance as well, totaling over $1 billion the last two years. But we have to continue to articulate the value customers are receiving, and we will maintain focus on managing our own costs to deliver our products as efficiently as possible. We also address bill impacts in our approach to rate cases. Our proposed deferral of 35% of ComEd's 2024 rate increase to 2026 is just one example, as is PECO's proposed expansion of the residential aid discount, and arrears management programs.\nEnsuring we are leading the industry in customer satisfaction remains a top priority for us. Now, Jeanne will provide an update on our financial performance for Q1. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Calvin. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial updates and progress on our 2023 rate case schedule, and I will also highlight the ways in which our utilities are advancing a smarter, stronger, and cleaner energy grid to better serve all customers. Starting on slide six, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings loss. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2023 versus $0.64 in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth of $0.06 per share over the same period.\nVariance growth was driven primarily by $0.10 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments and completed rate cases, including the uplift from higher treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE. We also benefited $0.03 from the reversal of other one-time items from 2022, including the discontinued operations adjustment from the separation and the customer refund in Illinois. These items were partially offset by $0.05 of lower earnings due to the sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures throughout the winter, impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions in Pennsylvania and Delaware, as well as $0.02 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company.\nResults of $0.70 per share in the first quarter reflect an approximate 30% contribution of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Historically, we have earned, on average, 28% of full-year earnings in the first quarter. Heading into 2023, we expected Q1 to be slightly ahead of historical patterns due to the completion of rate cases at PHI and PECO, rising treasury rates impacting ComEd's ROE relative to 2022, and the absence of the one-time items from separation. However, we were also seeing the impact of unfavorable weather at PECO and Delmarva Power.\nWhile the weather tempered some of that upside, we still delivered earnings ahead of expectations due to timing at PHI and the recognition of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd. Looking ahead to next quarter, after factoring in some PHI year-over-year timing items, the relative EPS contribution in the second quarter is expected to moderate at approximately 17% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range. The combination of Q1 and Q2 will result in achieving approximately 47% for projected full-year earnings through the first half of 2023.\nThis puts expected results for the first half of 2023 in line with how we performed last year, delivering 48% of our full-year earnings in the first half of 2022. On a full-year basis, we expect the $0.05 of unfavorable weather experienced in the first quarter to be offset with a combination of O&M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation of PECO, and the full-year earnings impact of the carrying cost associated with the carbon mitigation credit regulatory asset balance. With this continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and our disciplined approach to cost management, we remain on track to deliver expected earned returns at the utilities within our 9% to 10% targeted range by year-end and affirm our full-year operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to 2.42 per share in 2023.\nIn line with past practice, we would not expect to revisit projected 2023 guidance until Q3, and recall our goal is always to achieve the midpoint or better of that range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 6% to 8% from 2021 and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to slide seven, as Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front since the last earnings call. Let me start by reminding you of two electric distribution rate cases in progress.\nFirst, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised their revenue request for a $47.8 million increase based on an updated test period in its electric distribution rate case, with full proposed rates going into effect on 15 July 2024, subject to refund. We expect a decision in Q2 2024. Additionally, as discussed previously, ComEd filed its electric distribution multi-year rate plan in January 2024, and we expect intervenor testimony due from the Illinois Commerce Commission staff on 22 May 2024, an evidentiary hearing to be held in late August 2024 as the next key milestone. A final order in the ComEd multi-year plan case is expected no later than 20 December 2024.\nComEd also filed its 2022 formula rate reconciliation, seeking recovery of $247 million in rates effective 1 January 2024. A key driver of the increase is the impact of US Treasury yields starting to increase from their depressed levels experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which, as you will recall, was reflected in 2022 earnings. Per statute, an order is expected on the reconciliation by 17 December. Since the last earnings call, there were three new rate cases filed. First, on 15 February, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution-based rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking a revenue increase of $105 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.5%.\nThe filing supports critical investments to enhance service and deliver safe, reliable, and sustainable energy for customers through key programs, including the company's EVsmart electric vehicle program and deployment of the Smart Energy Network program, which I will highlight later in the presentation. Because of these sustained efforts to modernize the energy grid, ACE customers experienced the most reliable energy service ever in 2022, with the lowest frequency of electric outages on record. As permitted by New Jersey law, ACE may implement full proposed rates on 17 November, subject to refund, and a final order is expected in Q1 2024.\nNext, BGE filed its second multi-year plan with the Maryland Public Service Commission on 17 February, which we provided a preview into on our Q4 earnings call. Covering the years 2024 through 2026, the multi-year plan details how BGE will invest nearly $2.3 billion annually in the electric grid and natural gas system and nearly $400 million total in electric vehicle and building efficiency programs. These investments will inject nearly $36 billion into the local economy and support an estimated 72,000 jobs, as indicated in a study performed by the University of Maryland.\nImportantly, BGE's infrastructure plan includes more than 300 projects and maintenance programs designed to continue meeting customers' needs and lay the foundation for the state of Maryland to reach its goal of net zero emissions by 2045, with an order as expected on the proposed plan in December 2023. As we have noted, we also requested that the commission provide an order on the proposed reconciliation of 2021 and 2022 costs totaling $77 million of under recovery in parallel with the order on the second multi-year plan. That brings me to slide eight, where I want to take a moment to highlight Pepco/D.C.'s Climate Ready Pathway multi-year plan that was filed with the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia on 13 April.\nPepco is requesting a $190.7 million revenue increase over the 2024 to 2026 period to recover planned capital investments that are intended to enhance the reliability, resiliency, and security of the local energy grid and to further support the district's goal to be carbon neutral by 2045, one of the most ambitious climate goals in the nation. Specifically, this will be done through investments in equipment and infrastructure that will enable the integration of more renewable energy, such as solar. They will also help customers access and adopt cleaner energy technologies like electric vehicles, and they will allow Pepco to manage load to ensure the electric service customers depend on is available when they need it.\nOf the many maintenance programs included in Pepco's proposed Multi-Year Plan, one involves replacing nearly 24mi of aging power cables with newer and more modern cables so that all customers experience high quality of service and high reliability. It is the customers and communities that are at the forefront of Pepco's Climate Ready Pathway plan, with a central focus on improving the social equity, and advancement of affordability of electric service. As part of that commitment, the company's multi-year plan filing proposes several measures to address affordability, including expanding enrollment for the residential aid discount program to include any customer who qualifies for any low-income program in the district, as well as enhancing the arrears management program.\nExpansion of these programs would help to further extend the reach of valuable energy assistance, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $21 million to nearly 30,000 Pepco customers in D.C., or on average $700 per customer. Pepco's multi-year plan comprehensively works to keep service affordable, foster a cleaner energy future, and improve reliability, resiliency, and security through significant investment. This influx of resources directed toward accommodating the next phase of D.C.'s energy transformation is expected to inject more than $580 million in the local economy and support more than 3,800 full-time jobs. An order is requested from the D.C.\nPSC by February 2024, based on a proposed 10-month procedural schedule. All our ongoing rate cases are proceeding in line with expectations, and you can find further detail on slides 20 through 24 of the appendix. Moving to slide nine, during Q1, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion commitment for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while also preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation.\nToday, I would like to talk about how Atlantic City Electric is enhancing the customer experience in South Jersey through the Smart Energy Network program, the last major initial smart meter deployment program planned for Exelon Utilities. Smart meters are foundational to a smarter power grid. They enable customers to better understand real-time energy usage in homes and businesses, and they provide enhanced information to make our systems more efficient and resilient. With a broad installation beginning in September 2022, ACE employees and their contract partners have been steadily upgrading approximately 30,000 meters per month, and all 568,000 meters are expected to be replaced by mid-2024.\nWhen fully installed and operational, the Smart Energy Network is expected to deliver $416 million in operational and customer benefits over the next 15 years. Most notably, these benefits include the ability to restore power faster and more efficiently. They provide tools that help customers use less energy and save money, as well as a reduced need for estimated billing and the capability to provide more detailed outage information when outages occur. They also allow for better integration of new clean energy technologies, including solar, which has experienced the highest penetration in ACE's territory relative to all of our other jurisdictions at approximately 25% of net peak demand.\nTo put a sample of the benefits into perspective, on an annual basis, ACE expects to eliminate 134,000 truck rolls, reduce major storm duration and cost by 10%, and save $4.5 million in annual contracted meter reading costs. The Smart Energy Network is a critical step in advancing a cleaner energy future for South Jersey and helping the state meet its climate goals. Leveraging expertise from its sister utilities, ACE is committed to using its collective resources to ensure all customers realize the full benefits of this meter upgrade initiative. This is the power of Exelon's platform. I will conclude with a discussion on our balance sheet on slide 10.\nAs conferred on our last earnings call, we project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P, and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12% over the guidance period, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at the lower end of that 13% to 14%. We continue to await guidance from the US Department of the Treasury, which we are optimistic they will issue before year-end, and we remain encouraged by the engagement they have in understanding how its implementation can impact energy infrastructure providers like Exelon.\nFrom a financing perspective, we have successfully raised $2.5 billion at corporate and approximately $2 billion for ComEd and the PHI entities. To date, we have completed over 80% of our planned 2023 long-term debt financing needs. This positions us well for any unexpected market volatility in the balance of the year. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt offerings, which is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with low-risk attributes. To reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity as a holding company by 2025.\nWe'll continue to update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeanne. Let me conclude our prepared remarks with a reminder of our priorities and commitments for 2023 as the premier T&D utility. It starts with operations. Operating safely and reliably is our core mission, and you can count on us to focus on that every hour of every day. Secondly, as you heard from Jeanne, we have a full set of rate case proceedings well underway that will set our path for the next three to four years given our multi-year plan frameworks. The transformation of our energy system requires a lot of coordination and alignment, and we welcome the opportunities to engage with stakeholders on the most effective and efficient means to meet our jurisdictional goals.\nAnd third, we are focused on executing financially. We're looking to deploy $7.2 billion of capital this year, more than ever before, while maintaining earned ROEs in the 9% to 10% range and delivering on our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. We have made great progress on our financing plan for the year while also laying groundwork for future financing needs, and we continue to focus on ensuring our balance sheet is strong. Last, we continue to focus on maximizing the value we provide our customers and ensuring we are serving them in an equitable manner.\nAs an example of how we are innovating to support a more affordable energy transformation, I'll point to BGE's recent partnership with the City of Baltimore. Specifically, BGE will share responsibility for improving the city's 700-mile conduit infrastructure, reducing the amount the city pays for maintenance capital improvements, and allowing BGE to take advantage of its contracting and construction efficiencies, all while ensuring a healthy conduit system to provide more reliable and affordable power. Beyond our direct operations, we will continue to support our communities beyond providing cleaner, more reliable energy, such as through our more than 75 workforce development programs across our six utilities.\nIndeed, investments like ACE's Smart Energy Network that Jeanne highlighted benefit greatly from those programs. In anticipation of this investment program, a six-year, $6.5 million job training program was established in 2018 to educate the workforce needed to fill the energy jobs of the future in New Jersey. Fourteen of our talented employees deploying the smart meter technology are graduates of that development program established five years ago, and we expect to hire more than 15 additional graduates by the end of June, reinforcing our vision of facilitating an energy transformation that will stretch over generations of thoughtful planning and coordination.\nWe look forward to building on the progress made in these first three months and meeting our commitments in 2023. We are delivering on course. Thank you, and we welcome your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star 11 on your telephone keypad. Please stand by for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Morning, Shar. Good morning. So hey, guys, just if we could maybe start with Illinois. I mean, we obviously saw the trial outcome last night. Realized you guys have taken a lot of steps since 2020 to improve. But any sort of high-level read-throughs to the regulatory construct at this point, or anything remaining for ComEd from a legal or even judicial standpoint? Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, Shar.So first, from the start, as you know, Shar, we have cooperated fully with the investigations conducted by the government and our regulators. The deferred prosecution agreement signed in 2020 resolved the Justice Department's investigation into ComEd. But we want to be clear that we have done much more than that. We have made substantial changes to our contracting, lobbying, and compliance operations to ensure that the conduct that was at issue in the trial does not happen again. At all levels, from my office and throughout the leaders of the organization and the 6,300 employees who keep the lights on every day in Illinois, we are committed to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior for our business.\nWe have the privilege and the responsibility of representing well over 10 million customers, and we do not take that lightly. But I want to have Jeanne spend some time talking about the other issues that have come as a result of this, and then I'm going to ask Gil, CEO of ComEd, to kind of walk through, to your question, the regulatory and legislative proceedings as we move forward. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Calvin. And good morning, Shar. So as Calvin mentioned, the deferred prosecution agreement entered to resolve our matter with the Department of Justice. But there have been a couple of things that we've outlined in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs that were legal matters surrounding the events leading to the DPA. And I'll just touch briefly on those. And again, these will all be disclosed when the 10-Q comes out. And they continue to be updated, and you'll see it when the 10-Q comes out later today. But we did have a securities suit, some derivative suits, some consumer fraud suits, and then there was the SEC investigation.\nSo just ticking through those. The securities suit was filed in 2019, and there's a next court status for that set for late June. So based on recent developments, we have booked a probable loss in this matter of $173 million, but that is expected to be fully recovered by insurance, so there's no earnings or cash impact from that. There are three derivative suits pending, including one filed in 2021, and there were a couple of new ones filed in April and May of this year. They all assert similar claims, and there's no updates from a financial perspective on those. But I would remind you that that one is a little bit different in that any amounts recovered result in cash receipts to the company in those types of lawsuits.\nThen there were three consumer fraud cases filed, two of which have been dismissed, and we just argued our motion to dismiss the remaining case in late April. Then lastly, the SEC investigation continues. We continue to cooperate fully, but no update on that. So that's just kind of a status update. But again, we give kind of a play-by-play in the Q for those. So maybe I'll turn it over to Gil to talk through the multi-year plan. Yeah.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nOur proposed grid modernization plan and multi-year rate plan support 100% alignment with the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act and the Illinois Energy and Environmental Policy goals of an orderly and equitable energy transition here in our state. It is a product of extensive stakeholder process with multiple parties over the past couple of years. As you know, we filed our proposed rate case in January of this year, and we look forward to continuing working with all parties openly and collaboratively. As Jeanne mentioned before, the intervenors are scheduled to file their testimony this month.\nHearings will be in August, and the order in December of this year. So Shar, we're on course, and I appreciate that question.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nPerfect. And then just lastly, Maryland, obviously, Calvin set a pretty aggressive offshore wind target last month, 8.5 GW by 2031. I guess as we look at the plan today, could we see incremental transmission opportunities at Delmarva, I guess, put differently? What do you embed and plan at this point? Thanks, guys.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nSo if I can, what you're asking is that from Maryland's offshore legislation that they just recently passed, could that have a spillover that's happening along in Delmarva? Is that the question there, Shar?\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nPerfect. And as we're thinking about transmission opportunities, yes, correct.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. I think first and foremost, Shar, the legislation does present an opportunity for Exelon to participate in transmission. The amended legislation, as you know, requires that PJM conduct a study of the transmission system and take a more holistic approach with that. But what's nice about it, it will prioritize leveraging existing infrastructure, permitting risk and grid challenges, use of open access of collective transmission systems, and avoiding any single contingency items. So this all goes to how Exelon can differentiate itself from others. As you know, the state has a goal of reaching 8,500MW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2031.\nI think we are well positioned to be a part of that. I have David Velazquez next to me who oversees our transmission. Anything to add there? Shar, just to add, we do think that there's the potential for incremental opportunities on transmission there. We've not included anything in the current plan for opportunities that are there. The way the legislation reads, by the beginning of July in 2025, the PSC or the PSC will direct PJM to issue kind of a competitive transmission solicitation for the transmission that's needed to support the offshore wind.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nTerrific. Thank you, guys, so much. Appreciate it. Thank you, Shar.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nMd & Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning, Jeanne. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nGood morning, Paul.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nMd & Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. If you could, could you discuss the O&M savings drivers you mentioned in the script and just at what segments you're expected to realize the offsets for unfavorable weather? I think you said across the platform, which sounds broader than, I believe, it was PECO and Pepco, where the impacts were from weather.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll hit on it, and then Calvin, feel free to add too. So when you think about the $0.05, it's a combination of levers. I'll start with what we did to sort of enter this year in a conservative and financial matter. So you may remember we had some weather and storm favorability last year, and we did some de-risking at the end of the year to help us in 2023 and beyond. So that's helpful heading into the year. Second, if you think about where other volatility lies in interest rate exposure, we've really mitigated that risk by having completed our sole corporate financing in Q1.\nSo locking that in, and you can see that in the sensitivities in our deck. We have no exposure really on that. And then, as you talked about, right, we do have levers across the business. It would be more focused on areas that hit the bottom line, but then remember, as a corporate entity, dollars saved filter down to all the areas as well. And so it'll be a combination across the platform. In addition to that, they mentioned we do see some favorable depreciation at PECO relative to expectations. And then finally, we had, if you think about the $0.05 in totality, we had $0.01 of the favorability from the carbon mitigation credit deposit rate on that reg asset.\nOn a full-year basis, that's probably going to be about $0.03. So when you put all that together, clear line of sight to offsetting the $0.05, and feeling good about the rest of the year, and delivering in the range at midpoint or better.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nMd & Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Excellent. Thank you. And then changing topics, I saw the opportunity. Could you quantify how much that could be? And just confirming if there's any offset to rate base, those kind of items are factored into the plan. Thank you.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nHey, Shar, you cut out midway through your question. Would you mind repeating that, please? I mean, Paul?\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nMd & Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSure. I was asking about the IIJA, the Infrastructure and Jobs Act. I saw that headline during the quarter. If you could quantify what the opportunity could be for Exelon and just if there are any offsets to rate-based from kind of federal financing, if that's incorporated in the plan today.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nWhy don't you take that, and then we'll go from there, please?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Calvin. So the $700 million is what we've applied for. So it's a really competitive process. And so it's hard to estimate what portion of that we'll get, but what I can tell you is we haven't factored it in. So we're not expecting any meaningful impact to rate-based, to finance the needs. We're reaffirming everything. And then we'll continue to update you on that as that progresses.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nAnd I would just add, Paul, understanding, as we've said before, the IIJA and the IRA create tremendous opportunity for us as Exelon utilities, specifically to partner with our jurisdictions and drive this energy transition faster. And it also goes to the affordability factor of what we do and how we do it within our jurisdictions. So we're working it hard, and we're partnering and looking for all the opportunities to really increase in our investments, but more importantly, partner with our communities in this endeavor.\n\nPaul Zimbardo\n\nMd & Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. No, I know you are. Thank you both very much. Appreciate it.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman from Wolfe.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nMd & Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nYeah, hey. Good morning. Good morning, Calvin. So just on the Illinois, I guess we're going to get the recommendation soon on the multi-year, the new framework. So obviously, things like capital structure and ROEs and, I assume, rate base are the key variables. Are there any other, and then I guess maybe incentives? Are those kind of the key issues to monitor in the recommendations or any other things that we should be watching for?\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYes. Thank you. I'm going to let Gil take that in because he's been intimately involved in the process. Gil? I think you pretty much captured. Those are the items that we anticipate parties are going to be interested in.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nMd & Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. And then I think there was a minimum capital structure allowed under the bill. Is that still true?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. It's kind of like a. The 50%? Yeah.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThat's the same carbon harbor at 50%.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nMd & Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. And I guess my other question, the carrying charge or recovery on the CMC deferral, this is just CMC costs that you're not yet recovering in rates that you're earning a carrying charge on?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThat's right. Yeah. It earned a customer deposit rate, which was 0.22%, and then was reset at 5% at the end of last year, early part of this year. And so it's upside relative to expectations for this year. But that reg asset is expected to be collected and wind down by May 2024. So it's not a future year's earnings, but it is helpful this year.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nMd & Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. And then finally, on the IRS implementation of IRA and the minimum tax, is there been any developments or sense of outcome there, I guess, particularly the repair tax issue or just kind of sitting and waiting?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. Same status. Still about $200 million per year. That's all reflected in our guidance and both from an earnings and a credit metric forecast. We give you kind of the sensitivity of where we'll be if it isn't alleviated and where we'll be if it is. Still optimistic we get regulations by the end of the year, and still ongoing discussions with us, EEI, the industry, and Treasury on the repair deduction and in general how the corporate alternative minimum tax impacts energy providers like Exelon. Some further dialogue recently, I would say, about why the utility industry is different given the capital-intensive nature of our business. Just ongoing dialogue, but no new changes to the assumptions or estimates.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nMd & Senior Analyst, Wolfe\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director & Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, David. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. There's a new chair in Illinois. I was just wondering if you have had any initial dialogue or perspectives that you might offer on how it might be to work together with the ICC going forward, especially given that it's such a busy regulatory year.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. David, thank you for the question. I think, as I said in my opening comments, the transition of leadership and commissioners is part of the process. And so we are really engaging with all stakeholders in a very collaborative process as we move forward. But directly to your question, Governor Pritzker did accept the resignation of Chair Zalewski and has nominated the incoming person, Doug Scott, who, as you know, used to be the former chair of the commission and was very instrumental in the drafting and creating of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.\nAnd there has been communication, but the communications have been around moving the state's goals forward. And we have heard nothing to date that is taking that or derailing those efforts. And as Gil alluded to earlier in Jeanne, we're still expecting a final order on comments for your multi-year plan by December 20th. So also along with the new chair, they're getting a couple of new commissioners. And again, that process continues to move forward.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director & Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. And I was also wondering, with the ComEd and BGE reconciliations, I just wanted to check. Do there tend to be big swing factors in those regulatory processes, or are they pretty standardized just in terms of what costs fit in, and are they smooth recovery processes typically?\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. So on ComEd, the reconciliation they filed is for the 2022 under the 2022 formula rate. So this is a reconciliation that has been going on for 10 years. So I think that that one is a little bit more straightforward. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, part of that is the cash collection of the true-up on the treasury rates. Under the formula rate, you set the rates based on prior year's treasuries, and then you can recognize it in earnings, but then you true it up in rates later. So that one's pretty standard in the sense that it's been going on, and it's sort of clear.\nThe BGE one, though, is the first reconciliation under the multi-year plan in Maryland. So this will be the first time we're going through it, but there's a framework there to work through. So that order will come in December of this year as well. I think it's important for this year, but I think it's really important in terms of kind of what you mentioned, right, setting the precedent going forward so that we know what is recoverable, what's not, and you get into a place where you can say, \"Okay, if there's a variance here, I can put up a receivable or reg asset.\" Or conversely, if we do well, we put up a liability, and we'll give that back to customers.\nSo I think going through that will be helpful, as it has been we've seen in ComEd. Once you get through it the first time, it's very helpful going forward.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director & Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, David.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will be the last one, coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust wanted to dial into Maryland a little bit more if we could. We've seen changes in the commission, and there are these kind of policy goals out there. Just wondering how you see that affecting BGE, both the electric and gas side, or is that kind of offsetting over time? Or just wondering updated thoughts about the future of gas there and how that impacts Exelon.\n\nCalvin Butler\n\nPresident and CEO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. So great question. And with me in the room, I have Carim Khouzami, who's the CEO of BGE. But let me take the initial piece, and then I'll turn it over to Carim to see if he has any additional information. So just like Illinois, Jeremy, we're having a transition of a chair of our commission as well as a couple of Governor Moore appointees. Governor Moore has taken a very aggressive position to continue to push decarbonization and transportation electrification throughout the state of Maryland, really rivaling it with California, Illinois, and the like and moving forward.\nHaving said that, there is an alignment with the jurisdictional goals of what BGE is doing as well as Pepco, Maryland. The gas portfolio within our business is, we believe, critical to the long-term decarbonization of the industries. As we are going through the process of replacing the gas infrastructure within Maryland, we continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in that effort. And we've attacked it as a portfolio approach because reliability of the system and affordability for our customers is critical in our endeavors. So we have communicated that with the state. BGE has been very involved in those conversations. And I'll let Carim just take it a step further if he chooses.\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nPresident & CEO, BGE\n\nThank you, Calvin. And good morning. I think you hit on all the good points. One of the key points to highlight is, in last year's legislative session, the Climate Solutions Now Act, which set forth state goals for us to achieve as an economy-wide, laid out a number of working groups where they would determine what is the right path for Maryland going forward. BGE and the other Maryland utilities are at the table with all the other interested parties, and we're working through those issues now. And that will be concluding at the end of this year with recommendations.\nAs Calvin mentioned, there are a number of ways to get to the state goals. We see the pathway that is the most affordable, reliable, and resilient as being one that still includes gas as part of the infrastructure. We're working with the groups to kind of talk through what is the right path forward for Maryland. We do have confidence that gas will be part of the future.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful there. Then just pivoting to results, and just a smaller question overall, but I was hoping you could illuminate a little bit of color on the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations there as far as the change in environmental liabilities and the change in FERC audit liability, if just a little bit more color on what those items were.\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nPresident & CEO, BGE\n\nSure.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nYeah. Sure. So on the environmental liabilities, that's at the PHI, the legacy issue where we continue to update estimates for remediation of that. So we've just slightly increased the reserve there. On the ComEd item, ComEd, and on the FERC audit had an audit begin in 2021. We got draft findings earlier this year. And just based on ongoing discussions, we booked about $15 million of a probable loss. So that's ongoing. But that's kind of the nature of the two. And they're infrequent, unusual, and we carve them out from an operating perspective.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That makes sense. That's helpful. I'll leave it there.\n\nJeanne Jones\n\nCFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nPresident & CEO, BGE\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nPresident & CEO, BGE\n\nLet me just.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time?\n\nCarim Khouzami\n\nPresident & CEO, BGE\n\nIs that the last question?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. That was the last question. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.\n\nCalvin Butler",

My name is Gigi, and I will be your event specialist today. (Operator Instructions) Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.\n\nAndrew C. Plenge\n\nVP of IR, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.\nPlease refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nWe've scheduled 60 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.\n\nCalvin G. Butler\n\nCEO, COO, President & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be with you for my first earnings call as CEO of Exelon and one that concludes a very successful year for us. When I first joined ComEd in 2008, it was 1 of 2 utilities, along with PECO, under the Exelon umbrella. We recognized that we had an opportunity to take advantage of the power of the Exelon platform in a meaningful way. The company was already known for building world-class operations in the generation business, commonly known as our management model.\nOver the course of the next 14 years, we applied the same principles of best practice sharing and accountability through performance measurement to our energy delivery business. We were building a standard of excellence to deliver improvements in reliability, safety, customer satisfaction and value. I was fortunate and privileged to be part of guiding this evolution. First, as the lead to ensure the Constellation merger crossed the finish line in 2012 and then in my role as CEO of BGE, and eventually, as CEO of Exelon Utilities and COO of Exelon.\nIn those positions, the leadership teams and I were able to challenge our talented employees to take our Utilities to the next level. We sustained and expanded our operational excellence, improved customer satisfaction, enhanced team diversity and improved earned ROEs from mid-single digits to our 9% to 10% target first at BGE and then at PHI.\nAnd as you'll hear today, 2022 gave us a chance to showcase what we've built and ability to execute, push continuous improvement and achieve a balanced outcome for our customers and investors.\nBut as proud as I am about what our team has built, I'm more excited about what lies ahead. And I want to lay out our vision of who we are and what supports our value proposition. Exelon is the premier T&D company in the industry. Our platform is stable with sound fundamentals, both operationally and financially. This platform positions us to support our jurisdictions through the multi-decade energy transition that is just starting.\nWe can do it in a manner that supports affordability and equity while driving consistent stable growth for our shareholders, the type of performance that is a hallmark of a top-tier utility. What makes our platform unique? While we have an extremely diversified investment plan in size, scope and location, we have no generation. We have worked with our jurisdictions to operate under forward-looking rate mechanisms that provide value for our customers and predictable results for our investors and almost 3/4 of our revenues are decoupled.\nThis leads to a very compelling risk-adjusted total return of 9% to 11% built on the foundation of an unmatched platform, operational excellence and strong partnerships with our jurisdictions and communities. The Exelon team has proven it's ready to meet the challenge of leading the nation in its energy transformation, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and our communities, while creating value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn to Slide 5 and talk about our key messages for this call. I will start by recapping the strong performance in 2022. We executed right in line with our expectations, reporting operating earnings results of $2.27 per share. That exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $0.02 and represents 8.1% growth off of the 2021 guidance midpoint. We also had best-on-record operating performance at 3 of our 4 Utilities.\nAs for our rate case activity, we had 4 constructive distribution rate-case outcomes, including 2 gas cases and 2 electric cases.\nWe'll look to continue this progress in 2023 with several important rate cases this year. In January, ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission it's first multiyear rate plan and grid plans under the framework established by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The filing follows 15 stakeholder workshops, reaching more than 1,000 attendees as well as 45 stakeholder presentations. As Illinois progresses towards its decarbonization goals, ComEd is starting from an industry-leading position of strength.\nIn fact, in 2022, ComEd was recognized with the Outstanding System Resiliency Award for U.S. Utilities by PA Consulting while also maintaining an average bill that is lower than those in 47 of the 50 states. Beyond the rate case, ComEd in the City of Chicago announced a proposed Chicago franchise agreement and a related energy and equity agreement. Together, these agreements grant ComEd the right to continue providing electric utility services using public waste within Chicago and create a new nonprofit entity to advance energy and energy equity-related projects.\nThese agreements build upon the century-long partnership we have had with the city and demonstrates our alignment around key energy and sustainability goals. Pending approval by the city and Exelon Board, ComEd continues to operate in the city under the prior franchise agreement. And later this month, BGE will be filing its second multiyear plan for its electric and gas businesses with Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland following later in the first half of the year.\nLike Illinois, Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act has set aggressive climate and decarbonization targets, creating an environment where utility action and investment is a key priority and for which multiyear plan frameworks are particularly well suited. Jeanne will cover the rate cases and other regulatory activity in more detail shortly.\nAs to our projected outlook, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window. We are reaffirming our 2021 to 2025 target of 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth with the expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate. We are also initiating an identical target for 2022 through 2026 where we expect to deliver 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth over the 4-year horizon with the same expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate by 2026.\nThis is driven by the almost 8% rate base growth from 2022 through 2026, underpinned by deploying $31 billion of capital over 2023 to 2026. That's over $2 billion more than the prior 4-year period. As we balance the required progress on the energy transition with customer affordability, we continue to challenge ourselves to deliver maximum customer value at the lowest cost possible. We continue to expect some variability in our growth rates from year-to-year, due to our regulatory calendar, but we have maintained the transparency provided in the third quarter around our path to achieving our CAGR commitment.\nFor 2023, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.30 to $2.42 per share, with the midpoint that implies 5% growth off the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. Being slightly below the annualized earnings growth range is in line with the direction we provided on our third quarter call, but we do expect 2023 to be the exception. All other years are expected to grow within the range of 6% to 8%, if not above it.\nWe remain confident in the earnings power of our business. We expect an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in 2023, reflecting approximately 7% growth off of our $1.35 dividend per share in 2022. Jeanne will cover more of the specifics of our financial outlook.\nMoving to Slide 6. I want to spend a moment recognizing last year's accomplishments. Demonstrating the type of stable, predictable performance that our customers and shareholders expect us to deliver.\nFirst, we completed the separation from Constellation, which by any measure was a success and execute it in less than a year after our Board's decision to proceed. We did not miss a beat operationally, despite this separation. We invested more capital for the benefit of our customers than ever while achieving the highest ROE since 2019. We were able to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce in a difficult labor market, a testament to our culture of engaged and purpose-driven employees.\nAnd we didn't lose sight of the importance of supporting our communities through more than just the investments we're making in them. Our employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours and connected our customers to almost $600 million of energy assistance, an increase of over $100 million from 2021. We continue to build upon our history of workforce development, launching the Atlantic City Infrastructure Academy in the fall and graduating our first group of 26 students this month with the skills needed to succeed in careers in the energy industry.\nWe achieved our highest percentage spend ever, 39% or $2.8 billion of total spend with diverse suppliers. We gave $22 million to support schools and students in our markets. These programs include learning energy basics in middle schools and our Exelon Foundation STEM Academy that inspires high school girls to pursue careers in the energy field. And we are doing our part to create a cleaner and brighter future for our customers, making good progress on our Path to Clean with 112 miles of gas pipe main replacement and 12% of our vehicle fleet now electrified.\nThese are just a few examples of the type of work we do that has led to us being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 17 years running. Last, we delivered on our earnings commitment for the year. Ultimately, 2022 was about establishing and beginning to prove out the value proposition that new Exelon offers, and our team executed well.\nBefore I turn it over to Jeanne, I will review our operating performance for 2022 on Slide 7, which ended as strongly as it began.\nI'll start with reliability. We were top decile in outage frequency performance at 3 of our 4 utilities, and we were top quartile for outage duration across all utilities. Achieving performance like this requires sustained focus and effort across our business. First and foremost, it requires our team showing up 24/7 no matter of the time or the conditions.\nFor instance, Winter Storm Elliott struck our BGE service territory on December 23, taking out power to 112,000 customers. Our dedicated team completed over 1,500 repair jobs in sub-zero temperatures and at times to bring just 1 or 2 customers back online to restore power completely without any injuries. And it wasn't just our BGE team, the power of the platform showed up in force with ComEd, PECO and PHI supporting the restoration efforts.\nOn behalf of the entire leadership team, we want to thank all of our employees on the front lines of storm duty for their dedication. We would not have this track record of excellence without their commitment.\nOperational excellence also requires smart and prudent investment that's compensated fairly, built around alignment with our jurisdictions on shared goals and priorities. Last year, we invested $7.2 billion of capital earnings that 9.4% ROE I mentioned. The ability to execute on this level of investment with the confidence that we're aligned with our jurisdictions is a key element of our success. We need to perform every day to maintain that trust.\nOn safety, ComEd continues to maintain top quartile performance, while we work to get our other 3 utilities up to our standards. Our efforts to reduce serious injuries have been successful. But we are also focused on implementing safety best practices at our utilities to avoid other incidents that have driven OSHA underperformance in 2022. For the year, BGE, ComEd and PECO sustained top quartile customer satisfaction performance. This reflects our continued investment in technology to create a better customer experience. Our top quartile reliability and our commitment to an affordable energy transition.\nAnd finally, gas odor response continues to be in the top decile across all 3 utilities, including with BGE completing the year with its best on record performance. We continue to accelerate the modernization and safety enhancements of the gas system, while working with our customers and communities to live and work safely with gas.\nI will now ask Jeanne to review our financial updates. Jeanne?\n\nJeanne M. Jones\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by sharing my own excitement about closing out our first year as the new Exelon. As proud as I am of what we accomplished in 2022, I'm even more excited about our future. Our utilities serve the homes of more than 10 million customers. Customers that include our employees, our families, hospitals, schools and businesses. These customers increasingly count on us to keep the lights on, whether it's during winter weather arriving over the holidays or as the driver is getting ready to plug in their electric vehicle at their house for the first time.\nThat is not a responsibility we take lightly. But taking that on, while prioritizing energy equity and affordability, gives me confidence we will continue to maximize value for our customers while delivering steady returns on the capital investors and trust as well.\nAs I cover today's updates, 2022 results, upcoming rate case activity and the roll forward of our financial disclosures, you will find that our focus on execution drives the results that customers and shareholders expect. Starting on Slide 8, we delivered strong financial results in our first year as a new company. For the fourth quarter, Exelon's continuing operations earned $0.43 per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nFor the full year 2022, we earned $2.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.27 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Results that are in the upper half of our narrowed guidance range and represent 8.1% growth of the $2.10 per share midpoint of our Analyst Day guidance range for 2021. Throughout the year, we benefited from rising Treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE as well as favorable weather and storm conditions.\nThese benefits, along with strong cost control in our core operations, helped to offset higher interest expense at corporate and the businesses, along with the onetime items of discontinued operations and the voluntary customer refund in Illinois. That net favorability provided flexibility to reinvest back in the business and derisk future years while ensuring we were meeting and exceeding our financial commitments.\nQuarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the Appendix Slides 32 and 33. Moving to Slide 9. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we delivered within our 9% to 10% targeted range, with a 9.4% ROE for 2022. This is the highest our earned ROE has been since 2019 as we focused on mitigating inflationary pressures to ensure costs aligned with our allowed revenue. 30-year treasury rates improved as well, supporting ComEd's distribution ROE.\nLooking forward, we remain focused on earning the allowed returns of the utilities, which we expect will keep Exelon in the 9% to 10% earned ROE range annually throughout the planning period, while investing to maintain reliability and keep pace with our jurisdictions energy transition.\nTurning to our outlook for 2023. We are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.42 per share, reflecting a midpoint that is consistent with the directional guide provided in the third quarter. Relative to the midpoint of our 2022 estimated guidance range, the 5% year-over-year earnings growth is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as by increased revenues associated with completed rate cases.\nAs a reminder, expected year-over-year growth in 2023 is slightly below the 6% to 8% range as PECO enters the second year with its current electric distribution rates and anticipates returning to normal weather and storm activity. 2023 also requires managing against cost increases in our multiyear plans out [East] as we await their first reconciliations, particularly at BGE and the end of the stay-out provision at Pepco D.C..\nWith the derisking efforts we undertook in 2022, including initiating hedging programs for both our long- and short-term debt as well as for Exelon's exposure to the 30-year Treasury, we are confident that our projected earnings will be within the range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share in 2023. Additional detail on our earnings sensitivities reflective of our hedging activity to date is provided on Slide 34 in the appendix.\nAs you think about the shaping of 2023 quarterly earnings, I will remind you that, historically, we have realized approximately 28% of full year earnings in the first quarter, consistent with seasonal weather patterns at the Utilities and the general cadence of completed rate cases. On Slide 11, we provide our updated outlook for Utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2023 to 2026. We plan to invest $7.2 billion in 2023 and a total of $31.3 billion over the next 4 years, an increase of $2.3 billion from the prior 4-year planning period.\nSince the Analyst Day disclosures for the '23 through '25 period, we have identified an additional $875 million of planned investments to serve our customers. Updates include refinements to ComEd's distributional capital plan, which was developed as part of the multiyear integrated grid plans filed this January. The result is that over the next 4 years, our rate base is expected to increase 7.9% on a compound annual growth basis to $69.6 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.3 billion to rate base from 2023 through 2026, an amount roughly equal to the size of ComEd's current rate base.\nWith 4-multiyear plan rate filings planned for this year, I'd remind you that our capital forecast only reflects identified projects we expect to recover through our constructive recovery mechanisms. The plan reflects a disciplined prioritization of potential investments to balance interest, providing reliable service to our customers and progress on our jurisdictions energy goals while also maintaining affordability.\nOur plan remains free of any large (inaudible) projects. In fact, the largest transmission and distribution project in our plan remains the $300 million multiyear Erdman to Summerfield Transmission Expansion project at BGE. This project represents only 1% of our total projected capital spend from '23 to '26. And the collective spend on the largest transmission and distribution projects at each of the 4 operating companies totals only 2.2% of our $31 billion plan.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our ability to deploy $31 billion of capital for our customers over the next 4 years at affordable rates amidst persistent inflationary pressures would not be possible without a resolute focus on managing costs. At our adjusted O&M costs grown in line with average annual inflation of 3.2% from 2016 through 2023, they would have increased by approximately $1 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 1.7% CAGR for the same period, eliminating over $500 million of customer rate increases that would have occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies.\nThis includes leveraging our platform of 4 operating companies to share best practices and drive economies of scale. It also includes investing in innovative technology and processes, such as a recent pilot to conduct vegetation management work with the help of specialized drones, reducing a 2-day job for a human crew to 45 minutes of drone deployment. It also cost the material acquired by over 90%. We are particularly proud of keeping O&M growth low after the separation.\nWe committed to our customers that they would not see increased costs because of the separation, and I'm proud to say we achieved that. From renegotiating key enterprise-wide IT contracts to continually reoptimizing the organizational design for the services our Utilities need, our cost disciplined culture ensured that we kept that commitment while executing operationally at top-notch levels and delivering earnings in the upper half of our guidance range.\nIn 2023, adjusted O&M at our utilities is projected to be $4.2 billion, representing a 1% or $50 million increase from 2022, a rate well below the expected inflation rate of 4% in '23 and building on our efficiency efforts in '22. We will continue to ensure that our business is appropriately designed to efficiently deliver services as a transmission and distribution only energy delivery company. This steady discipline around cost has positioned us very well.\nIn the bottom chart, you can see Exelon's average electric rates are 23% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. Beyond cost management, other unique factors contribute to lower bills for our customers, some of which Calvin discussed. But I'd like to highlight the benefit of the carbon mitigation contracts resulting from Illinois 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA. Based on energy forwards as of January 31, these credits are projected to protect ComEd customers from over $3 billion of additional energy charges between 2022 and 2027.\nThat brings me to Slide 13 where I wanted to take a moment to highlight ComEd's commitment to decarbonizing the communities in Illinois in the most efficient, affordable and equitable manner possible. CEJA puts Illinois on a path to 100% decarbonized energy sector by 2045. It also provides a framework for ComEd to help support the state and make the grid investments necessary to support beneficial electrification, decarbonization and the energy transformation.\nIn one of its first steps to meeting the challenge of a clean energy economy, ComEd filed its multiyear integrated grid plan and multiyear rate plan covering 2024 through 2027 with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The proposed investment plan includes initiatives such as 4 kV to 12 kV conversions, bus reconfigurations, overhead and underground repairs and support for an anticipated 1 million electric vehicles by 2030.\nTo smooth the transition for customers from the formula rate to the multiyear rate plan, ComEd has filed to defer collection of 35% of the 2024 increase until 2026. An order is expected from the ICC no later than December 20, 2023. Turning to Slide 14. As Calvin mentioned, BGE anticipates filing its second multiyear plan and first multiyear plan reconciliation with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month.\nProposed investments expected in the filing support the climate and decarbonization goals of Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act. As an example of how we are partnering with key stakeholders in Maryland consider the electric school bus program. The new law created a statewide electric school bus program through which BGE will be able to offer $50 million in incentives to school districts we serve to help cover the incremental cost of purchasing electric buses with a focus on access for low income and minority communities, plus BGE will also be able to call on those new electric fleets to provide grid resilient support through vehicle-to-grid technology.\nThose types of initiatives are what drives the local economic impact highlighted on the slide, including the support of over 72,000 jobs. BGE's rate plan will cover electric and gas customer rates from 2024 through 2026 inclusive of a reconciliation on 2021 and 2022 cost from its original multiyear plan filing. Additional details will be available once BGE makes its filing later this month, with a final order expected by December 2023.\nWith Delmarva Power, Delaware's ongoing electric distribution rate case, and Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland's anticipated second multiyear plan filings, you can expect further discussion on these cases on future earnings calls. Turning to Slide 15. With $31 billion of projected capital spend, driving 7.9% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are projecting compounded annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2026 from our 2022 guidance midpoint of $2.25 per share.\nMaintaining our commitment to transparency from the third quarter earnings call, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2026 on Slide 16. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the 4-year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our commitment of 6% to 8% through 2026. As you can see on the slide, after 2023, we expect to deliver each year within the 6% to 8% range, if not above.\nWe have reaffirmed our guidance for '21 through '25 of 6% to 8%, with the expectation of being at midpoint or better. Similarly, we expect our 4-year CAGR from '22 to '26 will be at the midpoint or better of the 6% to 8% targeted growth range. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout ratio of operating earnings, with the dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings. We anticipate an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in '23, which is 6.7% higher than the 2022 dividend.\nI would like to conclude with a discussion on our balance sheet on Slide 17. The attributes of our fully regulated transmission and distribution platform, including forward-looking recovery mechanisms, majority decoupled rates, key concentrated investment risk and diversified jurisdictions, will continue to provide flexibility going forward.\nOver our guidance period, we project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgrade thresholds to 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. While the U.S. Treasury Department works towards implementing the Inflation Reduction Act legislation, our plan fully incorporates the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax, including reflecting the resulting deferred tax assets in each of the utilities rate basis, consistent with the recent rate case filings at ComEd and Delmarva Power.\nWe have talked previously about how regulations and the inclusion of certain deductions would substantially mitigate the corporate alternative minimum tax impact. Without the ability to include certain deductions, we expect the cushion in our average credit metrics to be on the lower end of the 100 to 200 basis points range. Our metrics would average closer to the higher end of the range over the guidance period if we were able to include those deductions.\nConsistent with our earnings profile, our credit metrics are expected to strengthen over time as we step into new multiyear plans and finalize the reconciliation processes. As we await clarity on the corporate alternative minimum tax, we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to cost and cash management across all areas of the business, ensuring we maintain appropriate cushion above our downgrade threshold of 12%.\nI will close by reaffirming our financing plans with the holding company. We continue to affirm the remaining $425 million of our $1 billion equity commitment. We expect to issue this equity sometime between '23 and '25. As we work with our jurisdictions and find opportunities for further investment at the utilities, we'll continue to ensure that our capital structure reflects a balanced funding strategy and a strong balance sheet, consistent with the expectations of our premium transmission and distribution company.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.\n\nCalvin G. Butler\n\nCEO, COO, President & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeanne. Before turning it over for questions, I will end with the focus of what's ahead for 2023. Operations and safety continue to be foundational. Maintaining reliability for our customers while operating safely is nonnegotiable. We'll deploy $7.2 billion of capital, ensuring we make the necessary progress to meet the reliability and technology needs of [tomorrow's] grid. Indeed, as many of you saw last week, the FBI announced it had interrupted a plot to damage Maryland's Power Grid. The need to enhance the physical and cybersecurity of the grid has never been greater.\nThe industry has made it a priority. The partnership between the industry and the government is key to our defenses. And on behalf of our employees and our customers, we greatly appreciate their vigilance and dedication by the FBI and U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland and protecting our nation's critical infrastructure. Thank you.\nDespite the urgency, investing capital efficiently will ensure we are making returns on our investments in line with those allowed by our jurisdictions, earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range. As a result, we expect to deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023, maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet and execute on a number of rate cases this year to sustain operational and financial performance in the future. As we deliver on this plan, we will continue to focus on the value we are providing to our customers.\nThis includes not only continue to advocate for policies that keep the customers as top priority but also continuing to evaluate our own business to find efficiencies as a more focused transmission and distribution only Utility.\nLike 2022, we have a lot we want to accomplish in 2023, but we again expect to be successful because that's what we do. And we know that's what you expect from the premier transmission and distribution company, one that's deploying $31 billion of capital for our customers with rate base growth and ROEs resulting in 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth and a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%.\nAs always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take your questions.",

Welcome to the Q3 2022 Exelon Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nAndrew C. Plenge\n\nVP of IR, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exxon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Operating Officer, who will join Chris, Jeanne and other members of Exelon's senior management team to answer your questions following prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. True results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nWe've scheduled 60 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nCEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Andy, and good morning to everybody. We're glad to have you with us this morning. As you know -- as you all know, yesterday, we announced my retirement from Exelon at the end of the year due to some health reasons. I plan on addressing that at the end of the call after reviewing the operational and financial update of the quarter.\nLet me turn through, first though, to the operating aspects of that announcement. Calvin Butler, our President and Chief Operating Officer become the President and CEO and a member of the Exelon Board upon my retirement. Since Calvin began with us to commit, he's been a key part the development of our industry-leading platform.\nDuring his time at BGE, he made customer satisfaction best-in-class, significantly increased the leadership diversity and became CEO of Exelon Utilities after that. In that role, heed continue to push the operating companies to align with the management model and drive industry-leading operational excellence.\nJeanne is now CFO, which we're very pleased with. Jeanne's been with Exelon for 15 years in various finance roles across the corporate and the former nuclear division. She was the CFO at ComEd and most recently Senior Vice President, Corporate. Jeanne has a very strong background and experience positions her well for the expanded responsibility. You'll hear from Jeanne momentarily for the financial update. And both Calvin and Jeanne will join me for the Q&A of the call. I would also like to thank Joe Nigro for his work launching the new Exelon and successfully executing the spin.\nHappy to report solid performance for the quarter. The investments we're making are on behalf of our customers, and they continue to drive strong operation and financial results. We reported GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $0.75 per share. We are reaffirming the midpoint of our range and narrowing it by $0.06. Jeanne will provide more color on that when she gets to her part.\nWe continue to execute at high operational levels, which I'll speak more about on the next slide. We had a construction rate case outcome this quarter. The commission in Delaware and Pennsylvania approved settlements on gas situation rates for Delmarva and one for PECO. We also reached a settlement on key elements with the first multiyear filing for Delmarva, Maryland, first settlement for the multiyear plan. We expect the final order in December.\nIn Illinois, ComEd received the final order on its performance-tracking mechanisms and the plan in September. That's a big milestone on the transition they're making to a multiyear distribution rate construct, and it gives us a good foundation to build upon.\nAs a result, we intend to file a multiyear distribution plan in January with a 4-year rate structure beginning January 1, 2024, continuing through the end of 2027. Choosing the multiyear plan over a future test year is the right choice for our customers and our shareholders. We appreciate the transparency and forward-looking planning and rate predictability that allows. Our rate case will be filed at the same time as our multiyear integrated grid plan with the final order by the end of 2023. So there's been a lot of good operational and financial progress this year, and we're on track to close a very strong year.\nWe know investors are focused on our outlook this year. First, I'll update you on the Inflation Reduction Act. We've always strived for transparency. So last quarter, we communicated the potential impact for higher annual cash tax as a result of the IRA. Since passing the bill, we've been working with the industry EEI, and we remain optimistic that Treasury will implement the guidelines in a way that materially mitigates the impact.\nRegardless of the outcome of Treasury, we're reaffirming our 6% to 8% annual growth target from '21 to '25, which I'll talk a bit more about shortly. In addition to reaffirming our growth commitment, we have emphasized the impact of a potential higher cash tax. Even in the event of the impact is not mitigated through Treasury regulations, we expect that higher cash needs will not require us to issue additional equity beyond the original $1 billion commitment through 2025.\nOn the positive side, the Inflation Reduction Act has very beneficial for our customers as we lead the energy transition. We look forward to a moment that we will build the industry as the industry takes advantage of this historic legislation past this year.\nOur jurisdictions are already driving for clean, and federal support enacted this year is more affordable and accessible to customers. We see opportunities in terms of -- and connect renewables, support alternative fuel production and distribution and make the grid ready for increased electrification, including electric vehicles. Legislation alongside the Infrastructure Jobs Act provide more than $550 billion in funding for energy-related infrastructure over the next 10 years, which will generate significant demand for our investments we make.\nFinally, I'd like to talk about our growth outlook. We told you on Analyst Day, we expect to invest $29 billion of capital to serve our customers and our communities over the next 4 years, which supports an annual growth rate of 8.1%. That will drive the long-term earnings growth rate.\nAs many of you know, add to achieving our annualized growth target is not linear, but 6% to 8% commitment through 2025 is our focus largely because the cadence of rate cases, we have some years that may be below that range and other years that will be above that range. You will see that more clearly when Jeanne covers first Slide 9.\nOn the operational highlights, Slide 5, we continue to ensure our customers receive safety, affordability and reliability completely, which underpins everything we do. Reliability remains at top notch. We were again in top quartile for outage duration over all of our jurisdictions, and outage frequency performance remains at high levels.\nComEd and PECO achieved their best-on-record performance. In fact through the third quarter of 2022, ComEd's delivered the most reliable service it ever has in over 100 years. Reliability is 82% better than when ComEd set out on smart grid improvements in 2011. Our customers have greatly benefited from the investment as reliability of the grid increases.\nThrough the third quarter, a testament to the reliability is increased data center growth in the ComEd district in the last few years. The data center additions have aggregated about 500 megawatts of new demand each year, approximately 9x the average of the annual amount seen earlier in the prior decade.\nFor safety, ComEd maintains top-decile performance, but the 3 other utilities continue to fall outside of that level of performance. We only -- we expect only the highest safety standards and performance for all utilities. Each utility is dedicated to implementing safety practices developed through lessons learned to minimize the chance of incident, and there's an intense training program going on with our first-line supervisors to help further educate that it has set the expectation, which all utilities are participating together, which helps.\nThrough the third quarter -- for 3 quarters, BGE, ComEd, PECO remained at top quartiles of customer satisfaction performance. Lastly, we made top desk outage performance in odor response across our 3 gas utilities. For the third quarter in a row, PHI responded to all gas odor reports in less than 1 hour.\nLet me turn over to Jeanne to provide the financial update.\n\nJeanne M. Jones\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, completed and upcoming rate case activity, and then as Chris noted, provide further clarity on our earnings growth trajectory and potential balance sheet implications of the corporate minimum tax.\nOn Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. Exelon's continuing operations earned $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2022 versus $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2021. As a reminder, the prior year third quarter reflects an $0.08 per share of discontinued operations adjustment for certain corporate and overhead costs previously allocated to Generation that are required by accounting rules to be presented as part of Exelon's continuing operations. These costs were paid for by Generation, and they are not indicative of our corporate overhead post-separation.\nExcluding this $0.08 adjustment, Exelon's third quarter results were $0.14 per share higher than the third quarter of 2021. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with incremental investment and completed rate cases relative to third quarter 2021, the impact of prior Treasury rates on common distribution ROE, the absence of summer storm activity and distribution formula rate timing at ComEd. This was partially offset by depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense on debt at the holding company. Year-to-date results and drivers from the prior year are detailed on Appendix Slide 14.\nTurning to the full year. We are narrowing our 2022 EPS guidance range to $2.21 to $2.29 per share from $2.18 to $2.32 per share. At Analyst Day, we told you we expected to earn 28% of our full year earnings in the first quarter, 20% in the second quarter and 32% in the third quarter or about 80% of full year earnings by the end of the third quarter.\nDelivering year-to-date earnings of $1.84 per share puts us slightly ahead at 82% of the midpoint of our revised guidance range, which considers the impact of higher Treasury rates at ComEd, on the distribution ROE, the absence of storms and our continued disciplined approach to cost management. These benefits are partially offset by higher financing costs at corporate and the businesses along with onetime items occurred in the first quarter. We are delivering on our financial commitments and are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end.\nMoving to Slide 7. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter has improved to 9.3% and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. The 50 basis point increase from last quarter is in line with expectations as timing of equity infusions from the first half of the year are offset by the earnings growth in the second half of the year.\nAs discussed on previous calls, we expect a trailing 12-month ROE to remain in our 9% to 10% target range at year-end. Our focus continues to be delivering strong earned returns at the utilities, which sustain the investment we make on behalf of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 8. There were some important developments in our open distribution rate case proceedings this quarter. Our successful execution builds momentum into 2023 when several jurisdictions expect to file a multiyear plan. Let me begin by highlighting key developments in the 2022 rate cases.\nOn October 12, the Delaware Public Service Commission approved Delmarva Power settlement agreement without modification for its gas distribution rate case. The settlement was for a $13.4 million increase in distribution rates, which includes the transfer of $5.8 million of revenues from the distribution system improvement charge capital tracker into base distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on August 14, subject to refund.\nAdditionally, on October 27, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint petition for settlement in PECO's GAAP rate case, including an annual natural gas distribution revenues increase of $54.8 million beginning January 1, 2023.\nWe also have 2 rate cases pending final orders. Notably, Delmarva Power reached a settlement on the majority of key elements for its first electric distribution multiyear plan with the Maryland Public Service Commission, including a cumulative revenue increase of $28.9 million beginning in 2023 through 2025, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%.\nThe ability to reach this settlement is a testament of the many benefits of this progressive rate design, including customer rate predictability, ease of regulatory burden and transparency into future system investments at our utilities. We expect a final order from the commission by year-end.\nLastly, we expect a final order on ComEd's final distribution formulary update in the fourth quarter. More details on the 2022 rate cases can be found on Slides 18 through 22 of the Appendix.\nTurning to 2023 rate filings. ComEd continues to prepare for a new rate filing in January of '23. Throughout '22, ComEd has been working with stakeholders on the performance metrics proceedings. On September 27, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued its order approving the performance and tracking metrics plan, which includes 7 performance metrics with a total value of plus or minus 32 basis points. The order paves the way for ComEd's first multiyear plan filing in January 23 for rates effective 2024 to 2027. Details of the filing will be shared on our fourth quarter call.\nThe multiyear plans across our East Coast jurisdictions have enabled investments necessary to improve reliability and customer service. They've modernized the distribution system and supported state environmental goals that have served our customers and communities well. Building on this momentum, we anticipate filing second multiyear plan at BGE in the first quarter, at Pepco Maryland in the second quarter and at Pepco D.C. in the first half of 2023. Additionally, we anticipate filing the first multiyear plan reconciliation with BGE expected to file in the first quarter of '23.\nOur first multiyear plan reconciliation is an important milestone that helps us throughout variances from the costs we filed as part of the multiyear plan in early 2020. Importantly, this reconciliation process will also provide our first opportunity to understand how the process will be implemented for any potential cost variances in future multiyear plans.\nAs you can see, next year, we'll be busy on the regulatory front, but we are excited for the transparency and stability the multiyear plans will continue to provide our customers and stakeholders. Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, teams and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals.\nAs Chris noted, this year's federal legislation only bolsters the support for and the affordability of the transformation of our energy economy. The multiyear plans provide a great structure to align on the pace and the progress of that transformation. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative recovery mechanisms, such as the multiyear plan by the end of our planning period.\nMoving to Slide 9. As Chris described, we are confident that $29 billion of investments we are making on behalf of our customers will result in expected rate base growth of 8.1% and 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth from '21 through '25. We have noted that our business model does include some variability in year-over-year earnings growth due to the timing of rate cases, largely driven by Pennsylvania, which generates strong returns that support the continued need to invest for the benefit of our customers.\nIn addition, for '22 and '23 at ComEd, we're exposed to the 30-year Treasury rate before making the transition to a more traditionally set return on equity. We've attempted to provide investors with additional information on the year-over-year variability with the building blocks of our earnings growth trajectory.\nAs defined in the chart, the gray arrows represent implied 6% to 8% CAGR path from the 2021 guidance midpoint of $2.10 per share as disclosed at Analyst Day through 2025 while the tildes illustrates expected year-over-year growth percentages from the prior year relative to the 6% to 8% range each year.\nStepping to the growth drivers, starting with '23, we have already mentioned ComEd and its exposure to the 30-year Treasury rate. Although current forwards imply we should see some good upside to its ROE, we'll need to monitor the impact through '23, which remains fully exposed to market move. People will be in Year 2 of its existing electric distribution rate per year cycle and, as a result, it's expected to have lower year-over-year earnings assuming normal weather.\nPECO's earnings should be positively impacted by new GAAP rates, transmission and its distribution system improvement charge tracker, which provides a mechanism for recovery on distribution investments made between rate cases.\nWeather and storm normalization will also be a factor in PECO's not being decoupled, and we are modestly benefiting from weather to-date. Like all companies, we face challenges from higher financing costs and inflation, which we are working hard to offset through productivity initiatives, investments in technology and by leveraging our size and scale. Reconciliation processes in '23 in Maryland and DC will help establish precedent for future cost recovery under the multiyear plan.\nLastly, at corporate, we will see increased costs as we continue to refinance our remaining floating rate debt from the separation as well as financing the investment needs of our utilities at the current higher rate. As we do have the utilities, we continue to challenge our corporate center to reduce costs.\nFor all these reasons, '23 is expected to be below the lower end of the 6% to 8% growth range based on our outlook as of September 30. In 2024, we expect to be in the range as we enter the next cycle of our BGE and PECO multiyear plan, which allow us to align with stakeholders for the next 3-year phase of the clean energy transition.\nPECO is expected to be in its third year of its existing electric distribution rate impacting year-over-year growth. Then with an expected rate case filing for PECO electric in '25 and the rest of our utilities growing generally in line with the rate base investments, we expect to be above the upper end of the 6% to 8% range in 2025. The combination of growth across these years should put us squarely in the 6% to 8% range on an annualized basis for the '21 through '25 planning horizon. You can expect us to initiate '23 guidance and provide a [record] of CapEx, rate base and financing plans as we normally do on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nTurning to Slide 10. Exelon remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and investment grade credit rating continue to be a top priority. Our long-term corporate consolidated credit metric outlook remains strong for both S&P and Moody's, regardless of the outcome of the corporate minimum tax. If the corporate minimum tax is enacted as written in the Inflation Reduction Act, the expected tax on balance sheet is approximately $200 million per year as of close in our August 8K filing. We are working with the industry and remain optimistic that this impact can be mitigated.\nEven if unmitigated, as Chris noted, we expect to observe the cash impact on our balance sheet with cushion above our downgrade thresholds, and we expect to be in our targeted 13% to 14% average range over the planning horizon without a need for incremental equity beyond the previously announced $1 billion commitment from '22 through '25. As a reminder, we issued $575 million in equity in August through a onetime offering and will complete the remaining $425 million over the '23 through '25 period. Our commitment to a strong balance sheet is a top priority to ensure we can make the investments needed on behalf of our customers.\nI want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $29 billion of capital from '22 to '25 driving 68% earnings growth from '21 to '25 and a strong balance sheet. This remains the case regardless of whether the corporate minimum tax is mitigated.\nThank you. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nCEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeanne. Moving to Slide 11. I'd like to emphasize Exelon's unique value proposition and place in the energy delivery industry. The economy is making the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy model -- as significant federal legislation passed this year, including the IIJA and the IRA provide momentum and support to our jurisdictions, which have been leading the way for years.\nExelon offers an unparalleled exposure to that opportunity. We serve more electric and gas customers than any other utility in the country in some of the largest cities of the country. We have earned the trust of our customers and our commissions by consistently and reliably providing top-notch operation performance. And we live our values with steady commitments to path -- to our Path to Clean goal as well as through environmental advocacy and support for our communities in a strong governance model.\nAs a result, there's a tremendous demand and support for investments we expect to make in our communities, which as I said earlier, totals at $29 million of capital from '22 to '25. And only in the beginning stages of the transition that will take hold in a few decades. None of our investments represent more than 1% of the $29 billion, and the result from customer growth need to keep up the customer demand and the resilience on the grid.\nSo we continue to feel confident in our 8.1% rate base growth and the projected 6% to 8% growth through -- rate growth through 2025. We offer a very strong proposition for -- we have offered very strong proposition and will continue for years to come with the balance sheet and matching dividend commitments, combining our 3.5% dividend yield with the 6% to 8% annual growth offers low risk to the 9.5% to 11.5% total return proposition.\nThat brings me to my retirement announcement. As noted in the release yesterday, I'll retire at the end of the year. And as I mentioned, Calvin will assume the role of CEO and a member of the Exelon Board. I've made this decision recently that I will need treatment for a significant spine and hip issue that require me to focus on my health. Because of these issues, I won't be able to join you at EEI, but Calvin and Jeanne and other members of our senior team look forward to seeing you there.\nBeing part of building this industry-leading company over the last 24 years has been an honor. Regardless of the economy, the commodity prices, the regulatory output, or our asset mix, Exelon has always focused on Job 1, running its operations safely and at top-notch levels to serve their customers. We have built an amazing platform over the decades.\nI want to thank all of our talented employees for what they have done to get us where we are today and recognize the diverse experience and innovative approaches that will get us to where we need to go tomorrow. While I'll miss being part of the team leading this energy industry transformation, I have all the trust in the world in Calvin and his leadership team to rise to the latest challenges and excel in many ways.\nAs always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take questions.",

My name is Dilem, and I'll be your event specialist today. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease note that today's webcast is being recorded.\nDuring the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jeanne Jones, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.\n\nJeanne M. Jones\n\nSVP of Corporate Finance, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Dilem. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nWe scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeanne, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I get into the quarter, I want to spend a minute talking about the Inflation Reduction Act bill that's being considered in Congress.\nWe appreciate those who have been working to position the United States as a leader in cleaner energy future and combating climate change. The bill extends tax benefits for familiar renewable technologies like solar and wind. It creates nuance for clean energy sources like nuclear and hydrogen. It also focuses on energy efficiency, electrification and, very importantly, equity. These aspects of the bill will enable this transformation for customers while building a domestic clean energy sector.\nHowever, the bill also proposes a corporate minimum tax that could undermine the benefits of those incentives and slow the investment needed to make this transformation. The lower cost of clean energy technology and efficiency investments will be offset by higher taxes on companies making investments. With this language currently proposed, we and other utilities could face an increase in cash tax.\nWhile the bill has yet to pass, specifics could change. As currently drafted, we could see an impact of incremental cash tax of approximately $300 million per year starting in 2023. The higher tax would ultimately limit our ability to invest in infrastructure needed to accommodate the clean energy our customers want and our jurisdictions are pursuing.\nBut the situation remains very fluid. We continue to monitor the bill closely as it moves toward a vote in the Senate and beyond. In the meantime, we're working to advocate for a language that better aligns the incentives to achieve what we all want: a cleaner, resilient, reliable and affordable grill -- grid. Yes, we're not getting a grill today. Cleaner grid.\nTurning now to the quarter. Our first one, since separating on April 1 -- actually February 1, we continue to execute on our plan, focusing on operational and financial excellence to serve our customers and our communities while supporting their environmental and social equity needs. We earned $0.47 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.44 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to expect our full range -- full year results in line with the $2.18 to $2.32 range we provided on our Analyst Day.\nWe've updated on previously announced plans to financing a small portion of our $29 billion capital investment program with equity, and Joe will provide additional details on our financing plan along with his commentary on the quarterly results.\nWe're on track to limit the number of rate cases we have this year. In May, Delmarva Power Maryland filed its first multiyear plan covering investments from '23 to '25 period. The filing highlights improvement in Delmarva's reliability and customer service in Maryland, '21 marked its second straight year of record-setting outage frequency performance. We look forward to building on the successes of the multiyear plans we have in place and leverage the lessons learned to deliver value for Delmarva Power Maryland customers.\nIn Illinois, ComEd continues to work on a new rate-setting process, including proposed performance metrics. We expect the final order by the end of the third quarter. In addition, on July 1, ComEd filed its first beneficial electrification plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission as required by the CEJA. ComEd proposes spending approximately $300 million from '23 to '25. The plan is designated to reduce barriers to beneficial electrification, including barriers to electric vehicles like adoption of costs and charging availability. And the plan approaches and emphasizes equity and environmental justice as we implement it.\nOur plan will ensure ComEd's investment strategy delivers on CEJA's groundbreaking environmental and social equity goals. As a reminder, ComEd's first distribution rate case under this new rate case structure will be filed in early 2023 for rate effective in 2024.\nAnd of course, we continue to support our communities and provide transparency to stakeholders on environmental, social and governance practices. We recently published our ninth annual corporate sustainability report, our first as a T&D-only utility. It details all the ways in which Exelon is a responsible steward of the energy transition and delivers sustainable value for our jurisdictions.\nFor instance, there's many programs going on, but, for instance, it discusses our STEM activities, which are in our fifth year this summer hosting approximately 180 young women in urban centers. I've been joining each of the three academies to talk with the participants.\nAnd in May, the Exelon Foundation selected nine young women that have graduated from our STEM program at academies to receive a scholarship for their college education totaling $1 million. It's quite impactful for those young women, and it was quite impactful to be able to speak to them directly and tell them what they have just achieved. So I kind of broke down when I did it, but it was really powerful.\nThe report also highlights $20 million Climate Change Investment Initiatives (sic) [Climate Change Investment Initiative], a program that supports start-ups with potential to have wide-scale impact on climate change risks. In mid-July, Exelon and Exelon Foundation selected nine start-ups to receive funding in the third round of the program. It's a 10-year program. These companies' business models address climate-related products and services like EV charging repair, carbon accounting platforms and other focus areas. We're very proud of the work that all our employees do every day to support the customers and the communities, and you can find all the details in our sustainability report.\nSwitching to Slide 5. Let me talk about our operational performance for the quarter.\nWe continue to provide safe, reliable service for our customers. From a reliability perspective, we've seen improvement from the first quarter. We now are in top quartile for outage duration across all jurisdictions, and ComEd and PHI scored in the top decile. ComEd delivered its best CAIDI performance on record despite severe storms in June. We met the restoration targets early, restoring 80% of 125,000 impacted customers in less than a day. And ComEd's distribution automation investment avoided almost 70,000 additional customer interruptions. Our outage frequency performance remains at top -- high levels with ComEd achieving top decile.\nOn the safety front, PHI improved to top quartile, but we did have a slip at PECO into the second quartile. We're doing additional training to address the primary drivers of the underperformance at both PECO and BGE. As always, safety remains our #1 priority. BGE, ComEd and PECO continued to earn top-quartile customer satisfaction performance through the second quarter.\nAnd lastly, we'll maintain -- we maintained the top-decile performance in odor response across our 3 gas utilities. PHI continues its streak of perfect execution responding to all gas odors reported in less than 1 hour for the first half of 2022. And this is very important for us to maintain confidence in the system, our gas distribution system, that we can find, fix and repair anything that comes up. So it's really good to see.\nAnd now let me turn it over to Joe, and he can provide the financial update.\n\nJoseph Nigro\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and highlight several ways in which our utilities empower the economic health and well-being of the diverse communities in which we serve. I'll begin on Slide 6, where we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings walk.\nExelon's continuing operations earned $0.44 a share in Q2 this year versus $0.36 a share in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, the prior year's second quarter reflects a $0.09 impact for discontinued operations adjustment for certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to our Generation segment that are required by accounting rules to be presented as part of Exelon's continuing operations. As a reminder, these costs were paid for by Generation and are not indicative of our corporate overheads post separation.\nAdditional information, including the full year impact of the discontinued operations adjustment on 2021 results, can be found in the recast 10-K which we filed on June 30.\nExcluding the $0.09 impact quarter-over-quarter of the discontinued operations accounting adjustment for service company allocations, Exelon's second quarter results were $0.01 lower than the second quarter of 2021. We did benefit from higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases, including higher treasury rates impacting Commonwealth Edison's distribution returns. But this was offset by higher depreciation and amortization, bad debt, timing of other costs at the utilities and the impact of rising rates on the debt at the holding company.\nAs Chris mentioned, we continue to reaffirm our 2022 EPS guidance range of $2.18 to $2.32 per share. Our year-to-date operating earnings results of $1.08 per share are exactly in line with the historical percentage of full year earnings and which we outlined at Analyst Day. Growth in the balance of the year will occur primarily in Q4 as we continue to realize the benefits of higher distribution and transmission revenues, including the net impact of higher treasury on ComEd. It will also include the absence of unfavorable weather and storms from the previous year and the timing of taxes and O&M spend that impacted us in the first 2 quarters of this year. Any updates to guidance will be provided on our next call for Q3.\nMoving on to Slide 7. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we expect to be in our consolidated 9% to 10% target by year-end. As of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month ROE of 8.8% was slightly below our targeted range. As we discussed on our last call, the timing of equity infusion supporting capital investments across all utilities outpaced the higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rate cases. We remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities, which sustain the investment we make on behalf of consumers.\nTurning to Slide 8. It was another quiet quarter on the regulatory front with one notable rate case development. On May 19, Delmarva Power filed its first multiyear plan with the Maryland PSC, the third of its kind in the state preceded only by its sister utilities of BG&E (sic) [BGE] and Pepco. The filing outlines the company's plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the local energy grid and other customer experience improvements during the 3-year period from 2023 to 2025.\nAs we've noted before, the multiyear plan approach allows us to align with all stakeholders on where the company is focusing its investments. Among the hundreds of projects, the plan specifically includes investments in the electric distribution system to continue to improve reliability and customer service, advance technologies to modernize the distribution system and provide tools to assist customers in managing their usage. We expect an order by the end of the year.\nWe also have three rate cases that are still in progress. Delmarva Delaware has a gas case with rates going into effect on August 14, subject to refund, and an expected decision in the first quarter of '23. Additionally, we expect a decision on the PECO gas case in the fourth quarter this year and on ComEd's final formula rate filing in December. Each case is proceeding in line with our expectations this year.\nOverall, we are pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers, ease regulatory burden and improve visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period. And more details on the rate cases can be found on slides 18 to 21 in the appendix of our earnings presentation.\nOn Slide 9, we want to spend a moment discussing the work that our utilities do to partner with local state and federal agencies as well as community groups to ensure we are maximizing opportunities for our customers to benefit from the various bill assistance programs available to them.\nWith the challenges presented in the last couple of years by the pandemic and recent inflationary pressures on customers, there have been increases in the funding available to support our most vulnerable customers.\nFor instance, the LIHEAP program has grown since 2017 by $400 million to $3.8 billion in total. However, the percentage of households taking advantage of this assistance has remained flat nationwide, implying additional opportunity to support our customers that has gone untapped.\nOur utilities, with their capabilities around billing and customer service, have stepped up to this challenge, looking for innovative ways to support the governmental agencies and ensure more eligible customers are taking advantage of the programs available. And I'd like to touch on just a couple of examples.\nComEd introduced the Community Energy Assistance Ambassador program, whereby it offered employment to over 100 local residents to serve as trusted partners to educate customers about financial assistance as well as energy efficiency.\nWith support from these ambassadors, ComEd was able to expand its reach into hard-to-engage communities, distribute more than 11,000 energy efficiency kits and connect customers to a record $146 million in financial assistance, representing a 95% increase in the number of grants customers received relative to 2020, while the PHI utilities, ACE, Delmarva and Pepco, also took advantage of local outreach strategies, leveraging a data-driven approach to ensure they were targeting the highest-opportunity areas. Furthermore, they also partnered closely with the relevant governmental agencies to identify and reduce logistical pain points around application eligibility verification and disbursement. These efforts resulted in customers securing $125 million of energy bill assistance, an increase of 70% from 2020.\nI can say similar approaches were also employed at our PECO/BGE operating companies, and Exelon's efforts across all utilities resulted in over $450 million of funding, making its way to more than 650,000 customers, which lowers arrears and less bills for all consumers. This level of funding represents a 22% increase in the assistance we were able to connect to our customers relative to the prior year. In fact, these efforts were recognized by EEI, who selected Exelon as an Edison Award finalist in 2022 specifically for the innovative ways we helped our customers in obtaining this assistance.\nConnecting customers to financial support is just one of the ways in which Exelon is ensuring its customers are making the transition to a cleaner and more resilient grid in an affordable and equitable manner.\nIf I move on to Slide 10. During the second quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $6.9 billion commitment for '22. These investments will improve reliability and resiliency, enhance service for our customers and prepare the grid for a clean energy future. Today, I would like to talk about the impressive effort led by BGE to replace a 1/2- century-old underground underwater circuit nearing the end of its useful life in the heart of Baltimore harbor.\nBGE's Key Crossing Reliability Initiative installed a double-circuit, 230 kV overhead electric transmission line across the 2-mile wide Patapsco River. Proactive outreach and early engagement with stakeholders significantly reduced permitting durations and allowed BGE to report great feedback into the project's design that benefited both BGE and its customers.\nThe reduced durations allowed overhead construction in the beginning of May of 2020 and complete 15 months early. Eight transmission monopoles were installed, including 2 of the tallest towers on the continent, which contemplated adequate clearance for cargo and cruise ships entering the Port of Baltimore today and into the future. Rig reliability improvements stemming from the Key Crossing initiative were made possible by the estimated 300 to 350 talented women and men who contributed to this project and all the constituents engaged in each [phase run].\nBGE opted to replace the segment with overhead transmission lines because the environmental impact was minimal and it was cost effective and it better supported the Port of Baltimore's shipping operations while having the greatest potential for local and domestic job creation. This project perfectly embodies our mission of providing clean, reliable, affordable and innovative solutions to all our key stakeholders.\nLastly, I want to provide an update on our balance sheet, which we committed to keeping strong to support the investments made for the benefit of our customers and communities.\nAs we announced in February of 2021 and reaffirmed as recently as last quarter's call, we plan to issue $1 billion of equity at the holding company by 2025 as part of a balanced funding strategy. We are establishing a $1 billion ATM program, and we plan to issue $500 million of equity in 2022, leveraging either the ATM program or a onetime offering or some combination of both methods. We will complete the remaining $500 million over 2023 to 2025, and we commit to continuing to update you as we make progress on these points.\nBeyond our equities plans, as we noted in the first quarter, we have completed our long-term debt financing at corporate for the year. There is no change to our expectation that our consolidated corporate metrics will average 13% to 14% at both S&P and Moody's over the 2022 to '24 period. And with a number of financings completed this quarter at our utilities, we continue to benefit from robust demand for that debt, backed by extremely strong credit ratings at our operating units.\nAs you've heard from Chris, we are monitoring the Inflation Reduction Act and its potential impact on cash taxes should the bill pass. We will continue to update you on that as needed.\nThank you, and I'll turn back the call to Chris for his closing remarks.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe, and turning to Slide 12. I'll close by reiterating the Exelon's value proposition and positioning in the sector.\nExelon is a premier T&D-only company in the nation, consistent with -- or consistent delivery and reliability results. There are several key attributes that distinguish us. We have an unmatched size and scale, leveraging a common platform across all our utilities. We consistently and reliably offer best-in-class operation performance. This drives a superior customer experience that -- and facilitates positive regulatory engagements in our jurisdictions.\nOur purpose of powering a clean, brighter future for our customers and communities is how important the ESG principles are to our company. And we maintain a strong balance sheet that drives investment needed to sustain our success. The net results in our operating -- or opportunity to invest the $29 billion of capital over the next 4 years for our customers with an annualized 6% to 8% operating earnings growth through 2025, and we expect to pay out 60% of those operating earnings each year to our stakeholders -- shareholders.\nThank you for your time, and now we'll turn it over to Q&A.",

The floor is yours.\n\nJeanne M. Jones\n\nSVP of Corporate Finance, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Olivia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeanne, and good morning to everybody and thanks for joining us. We're pleased to host our first post-separation earnings call as the nation's premier T&D utility company. We closed, as you all know, on the separation on February 1, delivering on our commitment to close within the first quarter of 2022.\nThe transition has really unlocked significant value for our shareholders. In the time of announcing a year ago through mid-April this year, the total shareholder return was 76%, far exceeding the UTY Index and the S&P.\nAt the same time, we continue to demonstrate our reliability focused on operational and financial excellence. We earned $0.49 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.64 a share on a non-GAAP basis. We also completed a successful bond deal for our holding company with attractive pricing, showing the value of our strong balance sheet even in a challenging market. Joe will cover the financial highlights in his presentation shortly.\nOn the regulatory front, it is quite a year, but we made progress in several jurisdictions to support our investment plans on behalf of our customers. This includes a settlement in Delmarva Maryland in the electric case, the gas filing for Delmarva Delaware and PECO and our last distribution filing under the ComEd distribution formula rate. In addition, ComEd continues to work with the stakeholders on the CEJA, last year's landmark clean energy legislation that continues to support what our customers and our stakeholders want. It's a clear path to Illinois electric utilities to transition into a rate-setting process. While we're ensuring to stake and support its ambitious climate goals and its social equity goals, we feel comfortable in our process going forward.\nComEd has proposed a performance metrics plan before the ICC which includes 8 performance metrics and 13 tracking metrics. As we adjust our proposal for stakeholder feedback, we're optimistic that the metrics approved by the commission will support continued improved in our -- improvement in our top-tier service for customers. We expect the final order by the end of the third quarter. There's a lot of work to be done between here and there. ComEd's also participating in the stakeholder process in a multiyear integrated grid plan workshop. The plan will help ComEd's long-term investment planning process and priorities with the exception of the regulatory's -- regulators in the CEJA. This is in preparation for our filing in early 2023 for rates effective in 2024. Joe will cover that case in a little bit more detail.\nBeyond the financial performance and operational performance, we continue to focus on our communities and the transition to a cleaner grid. We joined the DOE's better climate challenge in February, reinforcing our Path to Clean commitment to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gases by 50% by 2023 -- by 2030.\nAs part of the HBCU Corporate Scholars Program announced last fall, we have 24 students who were awarded $2.4 million in scholarships. This program will support the next generation to lead our clean energy future. It's astounding to sit with these young students and see their passion on where they want to go in the future.\nWe are funding support for small business development in underserved communities in our service territory for more than 65 workforce-type programs where we train and make individuals capable of coming into our areas ready for work. And our fifth annual STEM Academy will be held this summer in Philadelphia, Chicago, D.C, Baltimore area with approximately the goal now is 60 women -- young women to be involved.\nMoving to our operations on Slide 5. We're delivering safe, reliable service across the jurisdictions. Performance has remained solid and outage durations and frequency remain our top priority. Our utilities are working together to improve in specific areas.\nAs you saw this weekend, on the Mid-Atlantic utilities, the storms continue to intensify and the duration continues to be lengthened, but our operations teams are really focused on that in continuing to drive standards of construction reliability up.\nComEd's reliability performance was top decile in both CAIDI and SAIFI, delivering on the highest first quarter reliability to customers for any year on record. We made improvements in OSHA performance, bringing PECO up to top quartile, but we really are not satisfied with anything but the safest experience for our employees and our communities, and we still have work to go on that. There is no shunning that away. It's a top priority of all our operations folks. BGE and ComEd and PECO all achieved top quartile in customer satisfaction through the quarter. In all 3 of our utilities that distribute gas, we're in top decile on order response.\nPHI had perfect execution, responding to all its gas orders in less than 1 hour. And that's a very large service territory acreage-wise, so being able to roll the trucks and the employees out is a good feat that they've achieved. Joe will highlight some of our investments we're making to help deliver this performance.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Joe for you to hear the financial update and some of the strategic actions we're taking.\n\nJoseph Nigro\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Exelon Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, as Chris mentioned, our quarterly financial updates, and as he noted, highlight several areas in which our utilities are making investments for the benefits of our customers.\nIf I start on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings walk. Exelon's continuing operations earned $0.64 in Q1 of 2022 versus $0.55 in Q1 of '21.\nLet me start by reminding you the impacts to Exelon's financials following the separation. As disclosed in our 8-K issued on February 25, beginning with the 10-Q to be filed today for the first quarter of 2022, we are presenting our former Generation segment as discontinued operations for the 1-month period in 2022 prior to the separation and for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. Financial results for the utilities in the holding company are reported as continuing operations. As a reminder, accounting rules require that certain corporate overhead costs previously allocated to generation be presented as part of the Exelon's continuing operations. I want to note that these costs were paid for by generation and they are not indicative of our corporate overhead post separation. The impact of this business services company allocation adjustment to Exelon's continuing operations is $0.09 for the first quarter of '21 and $0.02 for the one month in 2022 on an after-tax basis. You will continue to see this adjustment for '21 as we present prior year quarters. However, this adjustment only impacts Q1 for 2022.\nExcluding the $0.07 quarter-over-quarter impact of the discontinued operations accounting adjustment for BSC allocations, Exelon's first quarter results were $0.02 higher than the first quarter of '21. The improvement from '21 was primarily driven by higher transmission and distribution rates associated with completed rate cases, partially offset by depreciation and amortization and storms at the utilities and the impact of rising interest rates on debt at the holding company.\nOur operating earnings results of $0.64 for the first quarter were in line with the percentage of full year earnings we shared with you in the January 2022 Analyst Day presentation.\nTurning to our full year outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.18 to $2.32 per share. While we have benefited from rising treasury rates on ComEd's distribution return on equity, like most companies, we were also impacted by higher interest expense in our debt, in particular at our holding company. As we normally do, we will update guidance on our Q3 call.\nAs a reminder, we have committed to a long-term operating earnings growth target of 6% to 8% through 2025, off the midpoint of guidance for '21 communicated on the Analyst Day.\nMoving to Slide 7. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we expect to be in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range by year-end. As of the first quarter, our trailing 12-month return on equity of 8.9% dipped slightly below our range. Despite higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates, the earnings were outpaced by timing of equity infusions across all our utilities to support capital investments. We remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities which sustain the investment we make on behalf of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 8. There were some important developments on the regulatory front since the beginning of the year.\nFirst, on January 14, Delmarva Power filed an application with the Delaware Public Service Commission seeking a $14.5 million increase in gas distribution base rates, reflecting an ROE of 10.3%. Delmarva Power customers continue to benefit from the major enhancements that are being made to the local natural gas system. Key projects to strengthen and create additional capacity in the company's natural gas delivery system have also been critical to meet growing load. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power will implement full allowable rates on August 14, subject to refund.\nSecond, Delmarva Maryland received a final order for its distribution electric rate case on March 2. The Maryland Commission approved the proposed settlement order by the Chief Public Utility Law Judge that recommended a $12.5 million increase in annual electric distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%.\nThird, on March 31, PECO filed a gas distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $82 million to support significant investments in critical infrastructure which will modernize and enhance the natural gas system and allow us to continue delivering safe and reliable natural gas service and reduce methane emissions. In addition, the filing proposes enhanced energy efficiency and customer safety programs, increase customer assistance with additional low income funding and the continuation of small business grant program. We expect an order in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFinally, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission on April 15, seeking a $199 million increase to electric distribution base rates that resulted in a $2.20 increase in the average monthly residential bill starting January 2023.\nWhile ComEd is requesting a delivery charge increase, there will be offsets. Specifically, when taking into account higher energy prices based on the recent procurement auction and forwards, offset by lower capacity prices, the carbon mitigation credits and accelerated tax benefit, we currently estimate a net reduction to the average monthly residential bill. ComEd's residential customer rates next January are expected to be at least 10% below the average of rates in the 10 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. In its formula -- in its final formulary filing, ComEd's request supports investments needed to sustain the record level reliability performance for residential and commercial customers and helps advance the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act passed in Illinois to address climate change, create clean energy jobs, ensure equity and prioritize a just transition to a green economy. We expect to receive an order by early December.\nWe continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions and are working with our regulators, our states and our communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative recovery mechanisms by the end of our planning period. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 17 through 20 of the appendix.\nSlide 9 provides an update on how Exelon's utilities are working with key stakeholders to help our customers and jurisdictions achieve their decarbonization goals reliably, affordably and equitably. Electric vehicle adoption is unquestionably a key enabler for reducing emissions as the transportation sector currently represents about 1/3 of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur jurisdictions alone are targeting 4.2 million electric vehicles on the road over the next 25 years, a twentyfold increase relative to the number of EVs in our service territories as of the end of 2021.\nGiven our competitive rates, electric vehicles also provide our customers the ability to save money. Using the Department of Energy's eGallon calculation, the annual cost of an electric vehicle is approximately $1.30 per gallon compared to the price of gasoline at $4.30 per gallon. On average, customers in Exelon service territories could save more than $1,000 per year in fuel cost by switching to an EV. Utilizing Exelon's EV time-of-use rates could offer an additional 11% savings per year. And while we recognize there are adoption costs and other barriers to entry, we value the role we play in bridging social equity gaps. Working with our jurisdictions, we bridge those gaps through programs like those authorized in the Climate Solutions Now Act in Maryland, which allows utilities to partner with local school boards and offer up to $50 million in rebates to incentivize the purchase and operation of electric school buses.\nAnd the benefits are not inclusive to EV buyers. As more energy use applications leverage the grid, fixed costs will naturally be lower for customers who have not yet made the switch to electric vehicles.\nAs our states make this transition over the coming decades, Exelon is poised to support our customers through investments such as upgraded distribution circuitry, substations and ultimately transmission. Transforming the grid over this period to meet the increased standards required by EVs, along with other expanded and innovative uses of the grid, will require significant investment.\nOur Path to Clean encourages customers and communities to reduce their emissions through access to clean energy solutions. When establishing our goals, the focus was not solely on the environment, but also on equity, affordability, reliability and sustaining our communities. The role we are playing in the transformation of the transportation sector is a great example of this commitment.\nMoving to Slide 10. During the first quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $6.9 billion commitment for 2022. These investments will improve reliability and resiliency, enhance service for our customers and prepare the grid for a clean energy future. As we have done on past earnings calls, I'd like to feature 2 projects within our portfolio of utility investments.\nThe first is Pepco's Harvard substation rebuild. This substation is part of a larger capital grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2023. This $220 million project will renovate aging infrastructure originally installed over a century ago to improve grid reliability and resiliency. The rebuild also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth in Washington, D.C.\nThe second project is ComEd's $39 million Project Goldframe. ComEd completed it last fall, 3 months ahead of schedule, to meet the customers' accelerated project timeline. To service new load obligations at the data center and the surrounding area, ComEd installed a new 138-kV substation and associated equipment, including an indoor control building, 15 138-kV circuit breakers, 4 capacitor banks and transmission line extensions to the DeKalb area in Illinois. This was the first large-scale project resulting from the passage of Illinois Data Center Tax Incentive Program in 2019. It will likely create additional renewable energy projects in the state as 100% of customer usage will be offset by wind and solar contracts.\nBoth contracts or both projects are great examples of how we are connecting our customers and communities to affordable, clean and resilient solutions while enabling economic growth and local job creation through these modernization investments. These projects in their own right have significant economic and social benefits to our customers and communities served. However, combined, they represent less than 1% of Exelon's projected capital spend from 2022 to '25. This puts in perspective the scale and the impact of our investments.\nMoving on to Slide 11. As you've heard us say at Analyst Day, our consolidated corporate credit metrics are anticipated to average 13% to 14% at S&P and Moody's over the 2022 to '24 time period. And overall, maintaining a strong balance sheet to firmly supporting investment-grade credit ratings remains core to our strategy and who we are.\nFrom a financing perspective, we successfully completed a $2 billion corporate debt offering in the first quarter, which completes our long-term debt financing needs at corporate for the year. This inaugural offering as a new company garnered significant interest from investors, enabling a very strong execution that was a true testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our new platform.\nAnd finally, there has been no change to -- in our guidance to issue $1 billion of equity at the holding company by 2025.\nThank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.\n\nChristopher Mark Crane\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Exelon Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 12. I'll close by reminding you all of Exelon's value proposition as the premier team, the only company in the nation. We're offering a great deal of value and scale, size and scale, which is particularly beneficial given the challenges posed in today's microeconomic environment and the storm intensity, as I mentioned earlier, over the weekend. We continue to be able to move resources and continue to be able to procure required needs in the right environment.\nOur best-in-class operations that have led us to a world-class customer experience and constructive regulatory environments, which is key if your customers are not satisfied, the regulators aren't satisfied and that's a major focus of us.\nOur commitment to ESG principles by driving to a cleaner energy economy and advancing social equity, as Joe mentioned, and a strong balance sheet that will ensure our ability to invest on behalf of our -- all of our stakeholders, not only the customers, but those that want to see a stronger cleaner environment, all of these factors support our opportunity to invest $29 billion of capital over the next 4 years in response to our customer needs which will lead to an annualized 6% to 8% operating earnings growth through 2025. We've targeted a payout of 60% of those operating earnings each year back to the shareholders.\nThank you very much for joining us, and now we'll open it up for questions that you may have.",

Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one again. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bert Subin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBert Subin\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Jacobs\n\nThank you, Audra, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to slide two of the presentation for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and operating metrics. Now let's turn to the agenda on slide three. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada, and CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing comments on the business, as well as highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal year results, and a recap of notable awards.\nVenk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end market trends, cash flow, balance sheet data, and our FY 2026 outlook. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nGood day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our Q4 and fiscal year 2025 business performance. We delivered strong results for Q4 and are pleased to end FY 2025, the first year of our five-year strategy, on a positive note. For both the quarter and the fiscal year, we drove strong double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, supported by solid revenue growth and robust margin expansion. Our consolidated backlog grew 6% to $23.1 billion, setting a new record to close out the year. PA Consulting capitalized on strong demand, delivering double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in the second half of FY 2025.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our results, and we see great runway as we enter FY 2026. During slide four, we provide a detailed overview of our quarterly and full fiscal year results.\nWe grew Q4 adjusted EPS by 28% year-over-year, and this was primarily driven by 6% net revenue growth, a record quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin of just over 14.4%, and better below-the-line performance. For the full year, we grew adjusted EPS 16%, largely as a result of mid-single-digit net revenue growth, and strong margin expansion. We've also seen a solid EPS tailwind from share repurchases, which we increased significantly during FY 2025. Reflecting on our expectations, last quarter, we guided to an adjusted EPS range of $6 to $6.10 for FY 2025, and we were able to finish the year above the high end of that range at $6.12.\nTurning to slide five, I'd like to highlight a few notable infrastructure and advanced facility project awards from Q4. These wins highlight the power of our strategy to redefine the asset lifecycle, as we prioritize expanding our addressable market with core clients.\nWe continue to see a positive outlook in water and environmental, particularly in the water sector, which remains one of our most resilient and high-growth areas of our portfolio. Our full lifecycle delivery model, enabled by deep domain expertise and leading digital capabilities, helps our clients address aging infrastructure, scarcity issues, and regulatory changes around the world. Demonstrating the trust our clients place in Jacobs to deliver long-term outcomes, we extended our operational intelligence agreement with United Utilities, the largest listed water company in the UK, through 2030.\nUsing our AI-powered Aqua DNA platform, we're helping modernize utility operations and deliver measurable, sustainable benefits for millions of people. In the life sciences and advanced manufacturing end market, data centers and life sciences continue to be two of the fastest-growing sectors in our portfolio. Additionally, our revenue growth in these sectors is now being complemented by new semiconductor investments.\nAs an example, we were awarded the design for a commercial-scale semiconductor fabrication facility by a confidential customer. Our scope encompasses the design and engineering of a greenfield semiconductor manufacturing plant, along with its related infrastructure and manufacturing support facilities. We're also seeing strong demand across the critical infrastructure end market, with all verticals performing well during Q4. In the UK, together with PA Consulting, we were named to the Crown Commercial Services Management Consultancy Framework.\nThis appointment expands our role advising public sector clients on delivering cleaner, smarter infrastructure, and maximizing value from public investment across transportation, cities, defense, and clean energy. In the US, we continue to build on strong momentum in the transportation sector. In New York, we were selected by the MTA, North America's largest transportation network, to deliver the Interborough Express light rail project, a transformative new 14mi transit line connecting Brooklyn and Queens.\nThe project will enhance mobility, reduce travel times, and promote sustainable transit-oriented growth for New York City communities. In summary, these awards reflect our continued momentum, and highlight the broad secular tailwinds driving growth across our business. As I reflect on FY 2025, we met or exceeded all of our annual targets, continued to drive robust bookings, stayed true to our disciplined capital returns policy, and now enter year two of our strategy cycle on track to achieve our long-term outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nThank you, Bob, and good day, everyone. During fiscal year 2025, we delivered on our commitment to drive profitable growth, which consisted of double-digit growth in both EBITDA and adjusted EPS, as well as a 7% free cash flow margin. We're demonstrating our differentiated business model through strong margin expansion, and we see continued opportunity to increase our margin profile moving forward. Now, please turn to slide number six, where I will walk through our results for Q4.\nWe finished fiscal year 2025 on a strong note. In the fourth quarter, gross revenue increased 7% year-over-year, and adjusted net revenue, which excludes pass-through revenue, grew by 6%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $324 million, growing 12% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q4 came in strong at 14.4%, which is an increase of 79 basis points versus the same quarter last year.\nAs a result, adjusted EPS rose to $1.75, a 28% increase year-over-year. Our disciplined cost management contributed to a new record adjusted EBITDA margin, both during the quarter and for the full fiscal year, and we're well positioned to build on this momentum in fiscal year 2026. Consolidated backlog was up 6% year-over-year to a record $23.1 billion, putting our trailing 12-month book-to-bill at 1.1 times. Notably, gross profit and backlog increased over 13% year-over-year during Q4, highlighting our strong sales performance. Moving on to slide seven, I'll recap fiscal year 2025 results.\nFiscal year 2025 total gross revenue increased about 5% year-over-year, with adjusted net revenue rising more than 5%. Revenue growth and higher margins resulted in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS increasing by 14% and 16%, respectively.\nWe're pleased to end fiscal year 2025 in a strong position, with mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, mid-teens adjusted EPS growth, and a backlog that sets us up well for the future. Regarding our performance by end markets in infrastructure and advanced facilities, let's now turn to slide number eight. At a high level, net revenue growth across our three end markets was fairly consistent in fiscal year 2025, with water and environmental and life sciences and advanced manufacturing growing just over 4%, and critical infrastructure at about 6%. Focusing on Q4, net revenue increased more than 9% year-on-year in critical infrastructure.\nOur strong growth was a function of several key programs ramping up in the transportation sector, and continued momentum in energy and power, with favorable trends in both the US and internationally.\nAs we look ahead, we believe continued tailwinds in the transportation, energy, and power sectors will be underpinned by improvement in cities and places. In our life sciences and advanced manufacturing end market, net revenue grew a little more than 5% in Q4, a modest improvement from Q3. During the quarter, we saw strong net revenue growth in the life sciences and data center sectors, but at tougher comps in the industrial portion of the portfolio. Positively, we're on track to fully lap these tougher comps and are seeing semiconductor programs ramp up, which we believe will benefit our setup in fiscal year 2026.\nNet revenue for our water and environmental end market was roughly flat year on year in Q4. Our demand across this end market was mixed, with continued strength in the water sector, offset by softer revenue performance in environmental, particularly in the US, where both public and private clients moderated spending more than anticipated. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2026, we expect water to remain a key growth driver, and on the environmental side, opportunities are reemerging as we position for a return to growth. In summary, we're seeing favorable trends in each of our end markets, and believe we're entering the new fiscal year with solid momentum.\nMoving on to slide nine, I will provide a brief overview of our segment financials. In Q4, infrastructure and advanced facilities operating profit increased 16% year-on-year, with a modest tailwind from FX. In fiscal year 2025, operating profit increased 13% year-over-year and on a constant currency basis. Infrastructure and advanced facilities results were aided by both revenue growth and margin expansion. Now, moving to PA Consulting's performance, revenue increased 10% year-on-year in Q4. This contributed to a 17% increase in operating profit, or 13% in constant currency, on a strong operating margin of 23%.\nPA continued to benefit from rising demand for services in the public and national security sectors, driving double-digit growth in their backlog. For fiscal year 2025, operating growth for PA was in line with Q4 performance. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2026, we anticipate PA's revenue growth will be similar to our consolidated growth rate. Turning now to slide 10, we provide an overview of cash generation and our balance sheet. For fiscal year 2025, free cash flow generation came in at $607 million. As a reminder, this does not add back the impact of restructuring or other charges.\nGood free cash flow generation and our high-quality balance sheet enabled us to repurchase $754 million of our shares and pay out $153 million in cash dividends. As a result, we returned approximately 150% of our free cash flow during the fiscal year. Adding in our dividend of momentum shares distributed in May, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2025, a company record. We also paid down debt, ending the year with $1 billion in net debt, yielding a net leverage ratio of 0.8 times on LTM adjusted EBITDA, which is below our 1.0 to 1.5 times target range. Our balance sheet strength supports continued investment in the business, along with continued returns to shareholders via share repurchases, as well as long-term dividend growth.\nOur commitment to return capital to shareholders is evidenced by a recently approved $0.32 per share dividend, representing 10% year-over-year growth, and our material increase in share repurchase activity this year. Finally, please turn to slide number 11 for our fiscal year 2026 outlook. We expect adjusted net revenue to increase 6% to 10% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 14.4% to 14.7%, adjusted EPS to range from $6.90 to $7.30, and free cash flow margin, which is free cash flow divided by adjusted net revenue, to be in the range of 7% to 8%. Notably, our outlook for fiscal year 2026 implies 16% year-on-year growth in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. We provide relevant assumptions on the right side of the page to help with your modeling.\nOne item to be mindful of is the fact that fiscal year 2026 will include an extra week during Q4, adding just over a point and a half to our net revenue growth rate. Additionally, as it pertains to Q1, we're forecasting 5.5% to 7.5% net revenue growth and a low to mid 13% margin. Note that Q1 is typically our seasonally slowest quarter due to holiday timing. In summary, fiscal year 2025 was a great first year in our strategy cycle. We executed to our 13.9% EBITDA margin target, which puts us well on our way to reaching 16% by fiscal year 2029. We grew the top line mid-single digits, demonstrating resilience in a dynamic macro environment.\nIn addition, we returned record amounts of capital back to our shareholders. As we enter fiscal year 2026, we believe we're very well positioned to build on our fiscal year 2025 performance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nThank you, Venk. In closing, we're proud of our continued strong execution in FY 2025. With a record backlog, expanding margins, and healthy demand across the sectors we serve, we're entering FY 2026 with significant momentum. Operator, we will now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Sangita Jain at KeyBanc.\n\nSangita Jain\n\nSenior Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nThank you for taking my questions. Can I start with the federal government shutdown, and if you think that had any impact on your fiscal 2026 bookings to date?\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nFiscal 2026 or 2025?\n\nSangita Jain\n\nSenior Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nWell, the fiscal 2025 ended and the shutdown started, so I'm trying to see if you had any impact in the early part of this year from the shutdown.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nNo, we did not. The bookings trend was those awards in the federal government happened before the shutdown. The short answer is no, Sangita.\n\nSangita Jain\n\nSenior Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nAll right, great. Can you give us an update on PA and how that process is unfolding?\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nSure, sure. Our negotiations continue, and I would say they're progressing. We've said from the beginning that we would be making a decision on that on or before March 2026, and we're on track to do so.\n\nSangita Jain\n\nSenior Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGreat, thank you. I appreciate it.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sangita.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Andrew Wittmann at Baird.\n\nAndy Wittmann\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, great. Thanks for hearing my questions. I guess my first question is just on the water and environment portion of your business. Obviously, we saw some deceleration here. Bob, you mentioned the environmental business has been a little weaker. I was hoping maybe you could just drill into that. It seems like the water side is strong. What was it about the environmental side that caused a little bit of softness? Would you tie that to anything, maybe the administration change or something else? What are the indications that you have today?\nYou made some comments that you see that improving going forward, and I just wondering kind of what that's based on. I thought you could drill in a little bit more there. Thank you.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, absolutely, Andy. Maybe just I'll start with the positive. The water sector continues to be strong. The pipeline is up double digits, as well as our booking trend. We still see high single-digit growth in the water sector moving forward into FY 2026 and beyond. That's global. All major geographies are participating in that. In the environmental sector, kind of two dynamics that played out during the year, well, actually during Q4, accentuated in Q4. One was we did have a one-time event, a positive on last year's comp. That was one. From kind of the core of the business, the regulatory volatility right now within the environmental world has put a bit of a pause for our private sector clients.\nUntil those kind of settle down, our private sector clients are tending to pull back a bit of the spend that we saw traditionally. These are some of the larger industrials, as well as chemical folks. On the public sector, it really was about disaster relief. The traditional, kind of the switch of FEMA funding and application down to the state level, there was a bit of a pause on how the states were going to, especially after the OBBBA was passed, how states were going to reorganize their budgets. We saw some delays in awards, as well as a pullback in FEMA.\n\nAndy Wittmann\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGot it. Was the FEMA the one-time item for the prior year, or you're saying that's not affected this quarter? Sorry, just.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nNo, the prior year, the Q4 of FY 2024, one-time event was a federal agency outside of the US that we had a one-time event.\n\nAndy Wittmann\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGot it. Okay. Just for my follow-up, maybe for Venk, we saw the guidance here on free cash flow. Just the bridge, you're now doing it as a percentage of revenue, but if you convert it back to the old way of doing it, it's under the 100% targets. I was wondering what the items in the 2026 outlook are that bridge you because obviously the business fundamentally is equipped to deliver at 100% or greater. That means something is kind of unusual or included in this number that we should know about. I thought maybe you could expand on that a little bit more.\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, thanks, Andy, for the question. I'd say, first of all, I'd point out that as we stated at investor day, free cash flow margin of 10% target, we're well on track for that. We delivered 7% this year, and we're guiding to between 7% and 8%. What we've imputed in that guidance is that there is a kind of a one-time tax event unrelated to our continuing operations that we're expecting sometime in fiscal 2026, so we just want to give transparency to that. On top of it, as Bob alluded to in response to Sangita's question, we are expecting resolution on our combination with PA, and we're just assuming some cash expenses associated with that. Those are the things that we want to factor in.\nWe feel really good about our free cash flow margin expansion, and we think that'll be a true indicator of the efficiency of the business. You're absolutely right. Our efficiency has been improving, and we see continued growth in that in fiscal 2026 and beyond.\n\nAndy Wittmann\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Jamie Cook at Truist.\n\nJamie Cook\n\nManaging Director, Truist\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question with regards to the margin performance in infrastructure and advanced facilities, we saw a nice improvement there. Anything unusual in the margins and how to think about the cadence of margins in that segment in 2026? My second question, Bob, to you sort of more strategically. One of your public peers came out this week talking about their competitive advantage on AI and what that means for margins for them over the longer term. You have similar business models.\nJust wondering how you're leveraging AI, and is there a margin opportunity outside of what you've already announced, given your peers came out with much more bullish margin targets longer term? Thank you.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jamie. On the first part with regards to margins in INAF, I'll let Venk take that, and then I'll address the AI question following. Venk, please.\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nGreat. Jamie, thanks for that comment. I'd say in terms of our margin performance in INAF, it continues to go up and to the right, really solid performance across the entirety of our business. Also, a good job of improving our cash collections and so forth. As we guided to in the prepared remarks, when it comes to Q1, there will be a sequential slowdown and a seasonal slowdown driven by a couple of factors. One is fringe as it relates to things like medical insurance costs and health benefits that typically have an impact in Q1, but you get the recovery in subsequent quarters. We'll see a linear progression in margins throughout the rest of fiscal year 2026, but we wanted to make sure that we were transparent in terms of how to model it for fiscal Q1. That's number one.\nAs it relates to the overall free cash flow margin target of 78%, imputed in that, as I mentioned earlier, is the fact that we're continuing to see operational improvements in the margin performance, combined with some of the one-time items that we expect to happen in fiscal 2026, and all of that is imputed in our margin guidance.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nOn the AI question, Jamie, we've been very vocal about this since dating all the way back to 2021. In fact, if you remember in our 2019 and 2022 strategy, it was the origins of the partnership with PA Consulting as well. This is a journey we've been on for over five years. How it's transpired, we see it as an accelerant, a differentiator, a space that we continue to use to primarily provide greater solutions externally for our clients. That has realized itself, and these are things that we've highlighted in the past, all the way back to 2021, being able to deliver a transformational effort for Intel as they were expanding their business model into a foundry model back in 2021. That was done through machine learning and digital replication.\nThat then led to our partnership with Palantir and all of the water platforms that we have developed since 2022, in reference one in Aqua DNA, as well as Intelligent O&M, that's really creating a differentiated position to gain efficiencies for our clients. Most recently, we announced a partnership with NVIDIA, where we're utilizing AI enablement platforms, as well as digital twinning technology, to simulate gigawatt-plus type data centers and creating a reference design for NVIDIA clients. Even going all the way up to today, StreetLight Data is providing unbelievable transportation analytics for major metropolitan areas around the country. In fact, over 26 state DOTs are utilizing the StreetLight platform. You look at that portfolio, and it's creating a differentiated position for growth in the market, and it is contributing to our margin expansion as we continue to go up the value chain.\n\nJamie Cook\n\nManaging Director, Truist\n\nThank you. Congrats on a nice quarter.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Andrew, excuse me, Kaplowitz with Citi.\n\nNatalia Bak\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. This is Natalia on behalf of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nAndrew.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nCongrats on the quarter. Maybe first question I'll start off with, you cited that transportation was a contributor to growth. I'm just curious how the funding visibility under IIJ is progressing. Are you seeing any delays or accelerations as new money flows through the states?\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nWe're not. We're not. That continues to be a catalyst, but I would say that transportation number we're seeing globally. It's not just in the US, but nice growth that we experienced in Europe, Middle East, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. It's something where, and again, it kind of goes to the previous question too, differentiated position utilizing strong transportation analytics and driving mobility concerns. I'd say IIJ is a component. Budget clarity in the UK is another component. Growth in the Middle East, as well as Australia, continues to be a really strong market for us in the transportation space.\n\nNatalia Bak\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Citi\n\nGot it. That's super helpful. Maybe just continuing on the strengths that you see globally in transportation, maybe more so just curious about the regional performance across your end markets, which regions outperformed expectations, and which ones are you expecting maybe to be a little softer into 2026? Any?\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, we're seeing growth across the board, Andrea. Our business domestically in the US has got some strong tailwinds behind it, but we're not seeing, oh, let me say it in a positive. Our business outside the US and internationally is in growth mode. We've got double-digit growth going on in the Middle East. Europe is going through a nice recovery, and Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand are really being buoyed by strong transportation and water growth. It's pretty uniform for us across the globe. I think add to just what Bob said, I mean, that's true of the PA business as well. We're seeing some good, solid momentum in the PA business, especially in the UK and continental Europe.\n\nNatalia Bak\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Citi\n\nGot it. Thank you. Helpful. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nThanks. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steven Fisher at UBS.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wonder if I could just follow up on Jamie's question on the margin in terms of bridging the expansion in margins between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, if you can kind of be a little more specific on some of the major puts and takes, be it cost savings, operating leverage, any specific investments that you're making to support AI and digital, anything that you can help us sort of bridge within that. Thank you.\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nYeah. Thank you, Steve. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, fiscal 2025, solid performance in terms of 110 basis point margin expansion, and we're guiding for between 50 and 80 basis points for fiscal 2026. A lot of what happened in fiscal 2025 was driven by some of the operating leverage and cost actions, as well as some early improvements in margin, especially as it relates to gross margins. We see a much bigger contribution, especially on the gross margin line going forward, driven by three things that we outlined at investor day, global delivery being a big component of it. As we look at the mix of business across the globe, we see that there's tremendous adoption of global delivery across our various end markets. That should be a meaningful driver of margin expansion for us this year.\nWe talk about commercial models and how with the adoption of AI that's increasing across the multitude of end markets that Bob talked about, that also makes a meaningful contribution to margin expansion. I would say multiple levers on the gross margin front, and we are committing to maintaining our operating leverage, meaning we want to grow our OpEx at a slower pace than our revenue growth, and that's driven by both efficiencies as well as what we do internally, as well as externally for our clients. A multitude of factors, we feel really good about our margin expansion story, and we're guiding for 65 basis points at the midpoint after 110 basis point expansion in fiscal 2025.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nVery helpful, Venk. Bob, maybe on the data center side, since I think you guys have a pretty interesting perspective and role in the industry, being on the front end of things, I'm curious if you could talk about the changes in the assignments that you're getting this year versus a year ago. What are your customers asking you that's different this year? How are the projects different? Is there anything more international or more domestic? Any changes there? Just curious your perspective on how things are different entering 2026 versus 2025.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nSure. Well, let me start with the geography and then go to how our scope is expanding in that area. We're seeing interest now in data center starts in the Middle East and in Europe in addition to the US. The US continues to be the strongest of the three, but it is expanding into Europe, into the Middle East as well. From a scope standpoint, our scope has traditionally been within the white space. The white and the gray space are now merging, and especially the work that we're doing now for NVIDIA is translating into more innovation happening within the server rack in that white space area. Then broadly, solutions around the power requirements behind the meter, as well as reclaimed water, that we're expanding our scope on that front too. All of that put together has really been a net benefit.\nJust another data point, Steve. In the last quarter, our pipeline in the data center space has gone up 5x. We're actually being selective on how we deploy that talent and growing that talent, not just in the US, but in the Philippines and in India as well.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nVery helpful, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Michael Dudas at Vertical Research.\n\nMichael Dudas\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Partner, Vertical Research\n\nMorning, gentlemen.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nMorning, Mike.\n\nMichael Dudas\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Partner, Vertical Research\n\nBob, maybe tailing off your last comment on pipeline, which is important, maybe you could share you've put out, I guess, your eventually two-year pipeline outlooks and your segments. Maybe you can refresh on that, how that looks today versus a year ago, and what areas should we be looking at as we monitor on bookings and progress as the year goes through? There are certain couple of areas. I mean, you just touched on some of them, but role for the pipeline and whether the conversions are going to happen sooner rather than later that might drive the 10% range of the 26 numbers.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nSure. Maybe, Mike, I'll kind of segregate it into two categories: one, by sector, and then second, by geography. By sector, I'd say the fastest growing pipelines, and I can quote some numbers here, in the data center world, just mentioned pipeline is up 5x. In the semiconductor world, we're seeing more growth there after some flatness over the course of the last year, and it's really centered around high bandwidth memory for the American client. In the US, semiconductor pipeline's up 20%. Life sciences continues to be strong, and in all those areas that we mentioned before, that's really been driven in the US. That pipeline is up 50%, and the water sector. The water sector continues to be a strong sector for us globally, and that's up 50%. Overall, the pipeline is looking really, really strong as we go into FY 2026.\nThe reason why I mentioned those four sectors is because that's where we'll see the fastest conversion of that pipeline in 2026 and in early 2027. From a geography standpoint, it's the Middle East. We just announced the award for New Murabba, specifically The Mukaab component of that. That's a huge, really good job for us. We're now on the expo, and we've got a few opportunities at Abu Dhabi and Etihad Rail that could convert here shortly. Across the Middle East region, we're seeing good growth leading up to not just the expo, but also the World Cup coming up too.\n\nMichael Dudas\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Partner, Vertical Research\n\nCertainly, the visit in Washington this week from the Saudis certainly can add to that visibility, I would assume.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nIt did. It did.\n\nMichael Dudas\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah, of course. The second question, Venk, just as we think about cadence through 2026 on free cash and share repurchase, just 2025 had a lot of opportunistic one-time issues, but how do we think about as you allocate that cash relative to share repurchase and whatever, maybe target on debt relief or what have you as we look through 2026?\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, Mike, thanks for the question. I'll answer the margin question first, which is, as we guided to, expecting a linear progression in margins, Q1 being probably the slowest in terms of margins, and then a steady increase right through the rest of the year, such that we feel good about the 50 to 80 basis points for the full year. As it relates to our use of cash, as we pointed out, our net leverage ratio is right now at 0.8x. We do want to maintain the optionality for additional deployment of cash for a potential increase in our stake in PA, as we've been stating all along. Outside of that, we want to be regular buyers of our stock. We truly believe in the value of being predictable in terms of buying back shares, and we'll do it at a regular quantum.\nIt won't be at the same level as it was last year, 150%, but we made the commitment at investor day to return at least 60% of our free cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends, and we're committed to that.\n\nMichael Dudas\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Partner, Vertical Research\n\nExcellent. Thanks, gentlemen.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from Jerry Revich at Wells Fargo.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nHi, Jerry.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nVenk. Hi. Given the top-line outlook you have for the year and, Venk, what you shared for the first quarter, you could be exiting if you hit the high end of the range with, call it, 13% pipeline growth in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about if you do hit the high end of the range, given the color you provided earlier, Bob, which end markets do we need to see that pipeline turn into bookings if we're talking about the high end of the outlook being feasible and exiting at that teen's growth rate in the fourth quarter if that plays out?\n\nVenk Nathamuni\n\nCFO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, Jerry, I'll take the first part of the question, then Bob can add a lot more color. I would say in terms of the sequential nature of the growth profile, as well as the margin profile, we expect to see continued momentum right through the year. As we stated, Q4 is the one which will have the extra week, so that'll have an extra boom, if you will, in terms of both revenue contribution, as well as margin contribution. In terms of the end markets, it's pretty broad-based, and maybe Bob can add more color on how we expect that to play out.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYeah, the ones that would drive the high end of the range, Jerry, would be life sciences and data centers, clearly. Really, that's a matter of those sectors moving at pace. That wouldn't have to be accelerated, just need to move at pace, and that would be a big contributor. We're seeing semiconductor fabrication facilities start to move, and if that were to accelerate, that would definitely be a tailwind. Momentum, I think on Citi's question with regards to transportation, that international transportation market would provide some momentum as well. Then major prospects. We're seeing major prospects in cities and places in the Middle East, but also we're now starting at the LA Olympics, as well as FAA and a few other kind of larger initiatives that would drive the higher end.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nBob, on data centers specifically, you mentioned a five-fold increase in that pipeline for you. Obviously, that market is very hot, but I don't think it's up 5x. Are you folks expanding the scope of what you're doing within data centers, or is it people are looking farther out to lock in services? Can you just expand on that five-fold comment, and if you're willing to share off of what base from a Jacobs' standpoint, that'd be helpful.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nYeah. Just to put in perspective, it's about a $200 million business for us today. Over time, I won't be specific on time, but that business could be as big as our life sciences business today in a few years. That's kind of where it's headed. I'd say it's across the board. It's hyperscalers. It's what we call kind of the neo cloud providers, as well as multi-tenant players as well. It's in just sheer numbers of people that are coming into the market. Our scope has expanded from a content standpoint, going within the battery limits of the data center into the water requirements, as well as power needs. That's a nice kind of adjacency with our energy and power group, then alternative delivery.\nSimilar to what we do in the life sciences sector, as well as in the water sector, where we do not just design, but program management for the delivery of the facility, we're now in that mode in the life sciences—I'm sorry, in the data center space as well.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nSuper. Thank you. Anything you could do to improve traffic in the New York area, a lot of us on the call would be grateful. Thanks, everyone.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nOkay. We're working on it, Jerry.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks.\n\nBob Pragada\n\nChair and CEO, Jacobs\n\nWell, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. We look forward to engaging with many of you over the coming days and weeks as we go on the road, and hope all that are celebrating the US Thanksgiving have a happy holiday.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bert Subin, Head of Investor Relations. Bert, you may begin.\n\nBert Subin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Krista, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating measures.\nNow let's turn to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing comments on the business as well as highlights from our third quarter results and a recap of notable awards. Venk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end market trends, cash flows and balance sheet data. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Bert. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2025 business performance. We delivered very strong results for Q3, meeting or exceeding our expectations across all key metrics. First, adjusted EPS grew 25% to $1.62, supported by 7% net revenue growth and meaningful year-over-year margin expansion. Second, PA Consulting capitalized on strong demand, delivering double-digit revenue and operating profit growth. And third, backlog grew 14% to nearly $23 billion, setting a new record.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, which enabled us to raise our FY '25 adjusted EPS guidance for the second time this year. We continue to monitor macro conditions and right now, we feel good about our operating environment. We are seeing secular growth drivers in life sciences, semiconductor, data center, energy and power and water sectors that have resulted in continued upward trends in spending across our business. We continue to manage well through an uncertain economic backdrop and expect to build on our strong Q3 performance in Q4.\nTurning to Slide 4 and focusing on our results. Adjusted net revenue growth of 7% in Q3, combined with strong year-over-year margin expansion helped drive a more than 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $314 million. Excluding the mark-to-market impact from our investment in momentum stock, which we now have fully exited and other items, Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.62, a robust 25% increase compared to the previous year. The small difference between this and our GAAP EPS of $1.56 underscores what we view as improving earnings quality.\nTurning to bookings. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.2x, with gross revenue in backlog of 14% year-over-year in Q3. Gross profit in backlog was also up 14% year-over-year, reflecting another strong quarter of sales. Our backlog growth and bookings momentum remained positive, positioning us well in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2026.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'd like to highlight a few notable Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities project awards from Q3. These wins highlight the power of our strategy to redefine the asset life cycle as we prioritize expanding our addressable markets with core clients. We continue to see strong global demand in water environmental, particularly in the water sector, which remains one of the most resilient and high-growth areas of our portfolio. Our full life cycle delivery model and deep domain expertise are helping our clients address aging infrastructure, water scarcity and regulatory challenges worldwide.\nThis quarter in the water sector, we secured additional scope for the Little Miami wastewater treatment facility with the Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati. This critical modernization effort will support region-wide biosolids reuse for 3 wastewater treatment plants, providing a renewable energy source to operate a 70-year-old facility.\nConstruction for the program is expected to be completed in late 2028. We continue to deliver solid growth in life sciences and advanced manufacturing end market with data centers becoming the fastest-growing submarket. At Jacobs, we have leveraged Digital Twin technologies for more than a decade to transform how critical infrastructure is designed, built and operated, most notably in the water and transportation markets.\nToday, we're applying that expertise to AI data centers, expanding beyond traditional design into intelligent integrated solutions. In a new partnership with NVIDIA, we're advancing the Omniverse Blueprint to create Digital Twins of AI factories, enabling high fidelity simulations that optimize power, cooling and network systems. Accordingly, we see the potential for this digital clean to serve as the reference framework for NVIDIA customers globally.\nIn addition to our key win with NVIDIA, we're also engaged by a confidential client during Q3 to provide engineering, procurement and construction management services for the transformation of a legacy manufacturing facility in the Southeastern and the United States into a cutting-edge high-performance data center. We captured meaningful scope on this program by leveraging our cross-sector capabilities, and we are seeing more and more opportunities like this in the market.\nWe are also seeing solid demand across the critical infrastructure end market with all verticals performing well in Q3. Clients are prioritizing modernization, resilience and smart technologies as they advance the next generation of transportation systems, airports, building and energy infrastructure. We're helping them achieve these goals through integrated solutions that prioritize efficient capital investment.\nIn Q3, we secured a landmark digital transformation engagement with our long-term client, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in partnership with PA Consulting, leveraging our expertise in both artificial intelligence and airport infrastructure, we are helping DFW accelerate innovation and enhance operational efficiency. Our #1 E&R ranking and airport design paired with our leading digital portfolio position us well for global demand across as air travel increases and airport investment needs rise.\nAdditionally, our energy and power team secured one of the company's largest wins in Australia year-to-date as the integrated delivery partner for the Marinus Link project. This 345-kilometer electricity and data interconnector between Tasmania and Victoria will provide 1,500 megawatts of capacity, enough to power 1.5 million homes playing a critical role in strengthening the reliability of Australia's East Coast electricity grid. This win highlights how we leverage global expertise in capital project execution and utility infrastructure to help clients meet their energy and sustainability goals. In summary, these awards reflect our focused execution in high-growth markets and our ability to deliver leading digitally-enabled solutions to our clients.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nVenkatesh R. Nathamuni\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Bob, and good day, everyone. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slide #6, followed by additional context on our quarterly performance. In the third quarter, gross revenue increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes pass-through revenue grew by 7%.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA was $314 million, growing more than 13% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q3 came in strong at 14.1%, which is an increase of 80 basis points versus the same quarter last year. As a result, adjusted EPS close to $1.62, a 25% increase year-over-year.\nOur disciplined cost management contributed to a new record for margins, and we're well positioned to build on this momentum in Q4 and in fiscal year '26.\nAlso, as Bob touched on, consolidated backlog was up 14% year-over-year to a record $22.7 billion, including our trailing 12-month book-to-bill at 1.2x. Gross profit in backlog also increased 14% year-over-year during Q3, a strong indicator of our positioning as we head into next year.\nRegarding our performance by end market and infrastructure and advanced facilities, let's now turn to Slide #7. Demand for services in the water, environmental end market remains favorable across all major geographies with very strong top line performance in the water sector during Q3.\nTotal adjusted net revenue growth for water and environmental rose more than 5% in Q3, and we expect growth to remain in a similar range in Q4, aided by continued demand strength in water. In our life sciences and advanced manufacturing end market, adjusted net revenue also grew approximately 5% in Q3. We've seen notable growth in the data center submarket that has complemented continued strong performance in the Life Sciences sector. As we move into Q4, we expect growth to increase relative to our Q3 results.\nIn Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased over 6% year-on-year. Within this end market, energy and power remain our fastest-growing sector, but improvement in transportation sector growth particularly in Europe, helped drive better year-on-year performance versus Q2. Encouragingly, growth in the cities and places vertical is also moving in the right direction on the back of Middle East strength. Looking ahead, we expect critical infrastructure growth to moderate slightly in Q4, but remain healthy.\nNow moving on to Slide #8, I will provide a brief overview of our segment financials. In Q3, infrastructure and advanced facilities operating profit increased over 13% year-on-year with a modest tailwind from FX. PA Consulting built on strong second quarter improvement and delivered a notable uptick in revenue growth to 15% during the third quarter. This resulted in operating profit increasing 15% year-over-year in total and 9% in constant currency on a 22% operating margin.\nPA Consulting's momentum in the U.S. and across the private sector was augmented by improving public sector spending in the U.K. We continue to see favorable trends in PA's, backlog and pipeline which have both increased double digits year-on-year. We believe growth in these metrics is a positive leading indicator of future results.\nNow moving on to Slide #9. We provide an overview of cash generation and our balance sheet. Overall, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape exiting Q3, inclusive of record capital returns through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '25.\nFocusing on the quarter, Q3 free cash flow was $271 million, which was in line with our expectation for free cash generation to inflect in the second half of the year, as earnings increased and working capital improved.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $101 million in shares, bringing our fiscal year-to-date repurchases to a record $653 million. Additionally, early in Q3, we received $70 million in favorable working capital adjustments from the CMS transaction, and finalize ownership of Amentum shares previously held in Escrow. We use these cash proceeds to further reduce our debt.\nIn addition to our quarterly cash dividend, we also distributed the Amentum shares released from Escrow to our shareholders on a pro rata basis. This represented approximately $159 million in incremental capital returns to shareholders based on the Amentum share price when declared.\nOur balance sheet strength supports continued investment in the business, along with continued returns to shareholders via share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. Our commitment to return capital to shareholders is evidenced by our $0.32 per share dividend, representing 10% year-over-year growth as well as our material increase in share repurchase activity this year.\nWe continue to view our shares as an attractive investment and have remained consistent buyers as a result. In total, we returned $927 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends over the past 3 quarters alone.\nSumming this all up, we ended the quarter at the low end of our 1.0 to 1.5x net leverage target and we're on track to return well more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal year '25. This puts us in a strong financial position as we close out the year.\nFinally, please turn to Slide #10. As we enter Q4, we are updating our outlook for fiscal year '25. We now expect adjusted net revenue to grow approximately 5.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 13.9% and adjusted EPS range of $6 to $6.10 and we'll continue to expect reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. As it relates to the fourth quarter, the midpoint of our guidance implies sequential improvement in net revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. In summary, strong Q3 performance, combined with our forecast for Q4, support our decision to raise the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings outlook.\nNow looking ahead to fiscal year '26, we feel good about our positioning. Since we're still in the planning phase, we'll provide a more detailed update on our expectations for fiscal year '26 next quarter. What we can share now is that we expect revenue growth to be ahead of fiscal year '25 with continued margin improvement as our gross margin initiatives begin to face it. Altogether, this should result in solid adjusted EPS growth next year. In summary, we expect to finish the fiscal year on a strong note and plan to build on this performance in fiscal year '26.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Venk. With FY '25 nearly complete, we are preparing for continued success in FY '26, aided by our record backlog and strong pipeline. We've navigated our first few quarters following the CMS and divergence solution separations very well and are just beginning to unlock the full potential of our business. As global secular trends take hold in our strategy to redefine the asset life cycle gains momentum, we see significant opportunity ahead.\nOperator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

My name is Christa, and I will be your conference operator today.\nAt this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Bert Subin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Bert, you may begin.\n\nBert Subin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Christa, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics.\nNow let's turn to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing comments on the business as well as highlights from our second quarter results and a recap of notable awards. Venk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end-market trends, cash flows and balance sheet data. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nGood day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2025 business performance. I'm pleased to begin today's call by highlighting several key milestones we achieved in the separation of our former CMS and C&I businesses during March and April. This includes completing the planned equity for debt exchange and finalizing the remaining post-closing adjustments. These actions enabled us to exit our retained stake, reduce outstanding indebtedness and on May 30, we will make a final distribution of Amentum shares to our shareholders. While we will continue to provide transition services to Amentum for the next few months, we view the primary aspects of the transaction as now complete.\nWe delivered strong operating performance during Q2, and I'd like to highlight a few key points. First, our adjusted EPS grew over 22% to $1.43, supported by solid year-over-year margin expansion. Second, PA Consulting's revenue growth inflected positively, reaching mid-single digits and driving double-digit operating profit growth. And third, our backlog grew 20% to more than $22 billion, a new record. Overall, we are very pleased with our Q2 results. A good start to the first half paired with strong bookings momentum enables us to reaffirm our full year guidance metrics.\nAs noted in our earnings press release, we recorded a reserve during the quarter as a result of a legal matter involving a consolidated JV in which we have a 50% interest. The impact to adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating profit was meaningful. The associated project falls within our water and environmental end market in INAS, and has been ongoing since 2016, but is now over 97% complete. The fact that we were able to absorb this impact in Q2, grow adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and particularly adjusted EPS by 22% year-over-year is a testament to our strong operating performance and capital return strategy.\nBefore I get into more details on the quarter, I'd like to briefly touch on the current geopolitical backdrop. Overall, our business remains well positioned, with infrastructure and consulting services in high demand and opportunities to capitalize on secular growth trends in front of us.\nThe impact related to the rollout of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has so far been de minimis, and we continue to anticipate growth opportunities with the U.S. Department of Defense. As a reminder, approximately 9% of our total revenue comes from U.S. federal infrastructure and related services, most of which are tied to DoD engagement.\nRegarding tariffs, we remain focused on supporting our clients as they assess potential supply chain challenges. Our client-centric model built on redefining the asset life cycle will create opportunity to add value as our clients navigate this period of uncertainty.\nTurning to Slide 4 and focusing on our results. Adjusted net revenue rose over 3% in Q2. Revenue growth during Q2 was adversely impacted by the JV matter I noted earlier as well as FX. On a constant currency basis alone, we would have grown 80 basis points faster or approximately 4% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $287 million, representing an 8% year-on-year increase. We are seeing very good traction on adjusted EBITDA margin improvement with solid underlying business performance.\nExcluding the mark-to-market impact from our investment in Amentum stock and other items, Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.43, a robust 22% increase compared to previous year. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.3x, with consolidated backlog up 20% year-over-year in Q2. Gross profit in backlog increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting another strong quarter for bookings. Our backlog growth and bookings momentum remained positive, and we are currently forecasting sequential growth in our second half results, which Venk will walk through in more detail shortly.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'd like to highlight a few notable I&A project awards from Q2. As we discussed at our Investor Day in February, the core pillar of our strategy is to redefine the asset life cycle for our clients. Today and going forward, we'll highlight how our awards align with our 5-year strategy.\nIn Water and Environmental, we continue to see strong underlying revenue growth, especially in Water, where global demand remains high, among the highest in our portfolio. Our differentiation in Water stems from our full life cycle coverage and proprietary technology suite.\nIn Q2, we secured an OT cybersecurity contract with Hampton Roads Sanitation District, one of the largest in the U.S. water sector. This project provides end-to-end cybersecurity for wastewater treatment operations, serving 1.9 million people in Southeast Virginia.\nAnother key area of focus for our water clients is emerging contaminants. PFAS and other contaminants present major challenges, and we are at the forefront of providing early-stage solutions for our clients. In Q2, we were selected by the city of Boynton Beach, Florida to design upgrades at 2 water treatment plants to remove PFAS from groundwater. Beyond addressing emerging contaminants regulations, these upgrades will modernize aging infrastructure and meet the region's growing demand for clean drinking water.\nIn Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, we continue to deliver strong results. Life sciences and data centers were the primary drivers of end market revenue growth, both seeing double-digit increases during the quarter. Life Sciences growth is being driven by broad-based investment, including a new engineering procurement and program management work for Merck's $1 billion oncology product facility in Delaware. The facility will have the capability to manufacture drugs like KEYTRUDA, and we expect to see backlog spend continue through the facilities estimated completion in 2028.\nFocusing on data centers, where we offer holistic cross-sector solutions that span advanced facilities, energy and power, water, environmental and digital, we were selected by PsiQuantum as the owner engineer for one of the world's first utility-scale quantum computing facilities in Brisbane, Australia. Backed by our #1 ENR ranking in data centers, we're proud to help bring this next-generation computing capability to life and see a great opportunity to expand our global data center footprint in the coming quarters.\nTurning to Critical Infrastructure, rising global travel demand, transportation modernization and energy security requirements are reshaping client priorities. We see global aviation investment as a durable growth driver for our Transportation segment, and one where we can leverage our core competencies in consulting and program management. Notably, in Q2, we were selected as the owner engineer for Denver International Airport's continued expansion of its transportation system. This is a prime example of Jacobs helping cities prepare for future growth with smarter, more connected infrastructure.\nIn summary, our significant awards this quarter reinforce our alignment to high-growth markets. We remain focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth by providing differentiated, digitally-enabled solutions to the world's most complex challenges.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Venk, to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nVenkatesh R. Nathamuni\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slide #6, followed by additional context on our quarterly performance.\nSecond quarter gross revenue grew 2% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes pass-through revenues, grew by 3%. As Bob noted, we experienced an FX headwind in the second quarter and also absorbed the impact of the previously noted [indiscernible] legal reserve in connection with a matter involving a consolidated 50-50 [indiscernible] joint venture.\nDue to the consolidation of the joint venture, the full amount of the reserve was taken against revenue. And as a result, impacted operating profit. However, the JV partner's allocable portion is included in noncontrolling interest. Therefore, the impact on EBITDA and EPS is half of the impact on revenue.\nQ2 adjusted EBITDA was $287 million, growing more than 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q2 came in strong at 13.4%, which is an increase of 62 basis points versus the same quarter last year. We were able to offset the anticipated impact in Q2 from holiday timing as well as the impact of the JV matter through some strong performance on gross margin and discipline on G&A costs. As a result, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS close to $1.43, a 22% increase year-over-year. Please note, GAAP EPS was impacted by a $109 million pretax loss associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum. This had no impact on adjusted EPS.\nFinally, consolidated backlog was up 20% year-over-year to a record $22.2 billion. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.3x remains very healthy. And gross profit in backlog increased 15% year-over-year during Q2, a strong indicator of our positioning over the coming quarters and years.\nNow regarding our performance by end markets in Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, let's turn to Slide #7. Demand for services in the Water and Environmental end market remains strong across all major geographies, with particularly good underlying performance in Water during Q2. Not only with core performance positive, but we also continue to grow our revenue in backlog, and our pipeline in Water is growing by double digits. Total adjusted net revenue growth for Water and Environmental was 2% in Q2, which includes the adverse impact from the previously mentioned JV matter. As we shift into the second half of the year, we expect net revenue growth to improve to the mid- to high single-digit range.\nIn our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market, adjusted net revenue grew approximately 6% in Q2. Facing better than our guidance, the revenue growth will be similar to Q1. We continue to see favorable demand in both the life sciences and data center markets, and we expect to see improvement in semiconductors in the coming quarters. Overall, we anticipate Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing growth will remain healthy in the second half of the year.\nIn Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased over 2% year-on-year. Within this end market, energy and power is our fastest-growing vertical, a trend we expect to continue. On the transportation side, we saw solid growth aided by the Middle East. Mid-single-digit revenue growth collectively in these 2 verticals was partially offset by flatter growth in CDs and places due to specific timing-related items. Looking ahead, we like our positioning in Critical Infrastructure and anticipate sequential revenue growth from Q2 to Q3.\nNow moving on to Slide #8. I'll provide a brief overview of our segment financials. In Q2, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit was approximately flat in total and on a constant currency basis versus last year. As we noted earlier, Q2 operating profit was impacted by the reserve taken in connection with the JV matter.\nAs we had guided, PA Consulting delivered a meaningful return to revenue growth this quarter along with strong bottom line execution. This resulted in operating profit increasing 12% year-over-year in total and on a constant currency basis, with a strong 22% margin performance. PA Consulting's momentum in Energy & Utilities and Life Sciences has been augmented by improving public sector spending in the U.K. We continue to see favorable trends in PA's backlog and pipeline, both of which serve as positive leading indicators.\nMoving on to Slide #9. We provide an overview of cash generation and our balance sheet. Overall, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape exiting Q2. We returned a record amount of capital back to shareholders during the second quarter, with very little effect on our net leverage ratio.\nAs we look ahead to the second half of the year, we're forecasting strong free cash flow generation. Focusing on the quarter, during Q2, free cash flow was negative $114 million, which was in line with our expectations and our prior guidance. This reflects a few seasonal cash timing events consistent with patterns we've seen in prior years.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $351 million in shares, which is a quarterly record for Jacobs. We also finalized an equity for debt transaction using our retained stake in Amentum, which reduced our outstanding debt by $312 million. Summing this all up, we ended the quarter right at the midpoint of our 1.0 to 1.5x net leverage target.\nSubsequent to Q2, we received $70 million in favorable working capital adjustments and finalize ownership and shares of Amentum that were previously held in [ Esco ]. We used the cash received from the working capital adjustment to further reduce our debt during Q3.\nIn addition, following recent Board approval, we will distribute the momentum shares released to [indiscernible] to our shareholders on a prorata basis at the end of this month. Based on yesterday's closing price, this represents approximately $159 million in incremental capital returns to shareholders. Our balance sheet [indiscernible] supports continued investment in the business, along with returns to shareholders via share repurchases and long-term dividend growth.\nOur commitment to return capital to shareholders is evidenced by our $0.32 per share dividend, representing 10% year-over-year growth as well as our meaningful increase in share repurchase activity in the first half of the year. In total, we returned $628 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends over the past 2 quarters alone. This puts us on track to potentially return more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal year '25, excluding the distribution of Amentum shares. While we plan to remain consistent buyers of our own shares, we also continue to evaluate increasing our investment in PA Consulting.\nFinally, please turn to Slide #10. We are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal '25 outlook for adjusted net revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14%; reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%; and adjusted EPS of $5.85 to $6.20.\nNow to assist with your modeling, let me highlight a few items related to the remainder of fiscal year '25. We continue to anticipate revenue will rise sequentially through year-end, with Q3 net revenue expected to grow 5% to 7% year-on-year based on our current view of global market conditions. Notably, a significant portion of our expected revenues in the second half of the year will come from our backlog. On margins, we expect to approach a 14% adjusted EBITDA margin in Q3, and we remain well positioned to meet our full year guidance range of 13.8% to 14%. We will control discretionary spending in response to market conditions. Overall, we feel positive about our adjusted EPS trajectory.\nIn summary, we continue to expect sequential improvement in net revenue and operating profit as we progress through the second half of the fiscal year. We're very pleased with our margin performance and strong trailing 12-month bookings, both of which set us up for profitable growth in the quarters and years ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Venk. In closing, with a solid first half of FY '25 behind us, we see a good setup in the second half of the year, aided by continued booking strength and margin momentum. With our sharpened portfolio aligned to critical global mega trends and our 5-year strategy driving focus and discipline, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nOperator, we will now open the call for questions."

GAAP EPS was negative $0.10 and includes a negative $1.16 impact from the mark-to-market loss in our investment in Amentum. Excluding this and other items, Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.33, an 8% decrease compared to the previous year. The year-on-year decline in adjusted EPS was a result of a favorable tax item last year that resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit in Q1 2024.\nTurning to Slide 5.

We are pleased with the strong underlying business performance, and we are seeing very good traction on adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.3x as our consolidated backlog increased 19% year-over-year in Q1. We are encouraged by the trajectory we're delivering on, following two extremely strong quarters for new awards in the second half of 2024. Gross profit in backlog increased 12% year-over-year in the first quarter, reflecting back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $282 million, which represented a 24% year-on-year increase.

I'm excited to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins across the business and across geographies, a testament for our market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We saw solid revenue growth year-over-year, mainly in our Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities segment. We are demonstrating impressive revenue growth globally in Water and Environmental with all major geographies showing strength in Q1.\nTurning to Slide 6.

During the quarter, we achieved significant milestones on two transformative projects. First, we were selected as part of the preferred alliance for the landmark River Torrens to Darlington project in South Australia. This $15.4 billion initiative by the South Australian government will deliver a 10.5 kilometer nonstop motorway completing the 78-kilometer north-south corridor. The TTD project is poised to drive economic growth and development across Adelaide and South Australia.\nTurning to Critical Infrastructure.

Let me begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slide 7 and I'll then provide additional context and detail around our strong quarterly performance.\nThank you, Bob. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slide 7 and I'll then provide additional context and detail around our strong quarterly performance.\nFirst quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, grew by 5% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $282 million, growing 24% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q1 came in strong at 13.5%, which is an increase of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year.\nFirst quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, grew by 5% year-over-year.

Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q1 came in strong at 13.5%, which is an increase of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS was $1.33, an 8% decrease versus the previous year, primarily due to an unfavorable tax comparison. As Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, last year, we benefited from a discrete tax item that did not recur in 2025. Please also note, GAAP EPS was impacted by a $145 million unrealized pretax loss associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum, which had no impact on adjusted EPS.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS was $1.33, an 8% decrease versus the previous year, primarily due to an unfavorable tax comparison.

Q1 book-to-bill of 1.4x was solid. Our trailing 12-month revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3x with gross profit and backlog increasing 12% year-over-year during Q1, highlighting our strong trailing 12-month sales performance. Going forward, we will focus our attention on trailing 12-month performance in our book-to-bill ratios as we believe this is a better indicator of future growth.\nFinally, consolidated backlog was up approximately 19% year-over-year and remains near record levels at $21.8 billion.

Going forward, we will focus our attention on trailing 12-month performance in our book-to-bill ratios as we believe this is a better indicator of future growth.\nRegarding our performance by end market, in infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, let's turn to Slide #8. Demand for our Water and Environmental Services remains strong across all major geographies, with adjusted net revenue increasing 11% compared to the same quarter last year. This momentum is expected to continue beyond fiscal '25 and is supported by our robust backlog and pipeline. We grew adjusted net revenue in our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market by over 1% in Q1 as Life Sciences strength was largely offset by softness in Advanced Manufacturing. We expect Life Sciences growth to remain robust for the foreseeable future as we continue to ramp on new projects.\nRegarding our performance by end market, in infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, let's turn to Slide #8.

In Q1, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit increased by 26% in total and 25% on a constant currency basis versus last year. PA Consulting results reflect roughly flat revenue performance year-on-year, but very good execution on the bottom line. Q1 operating profit increased 22.6% year-over-year and 19.6% on a constant currency basis. We remain encouraged by recent bookings and anticipate revenue growth for PA Consulting will improve in fiscal '25 as the year progresses.\nMoving on to Slide #9, I will provide a quick overview of our segment financials.

For Q1, free cash flow was healthy at $97 million, and we repurchased $202 million in shares, a sequential increase of $145 million. This combination resulted in our net leverage ratio remaining relatively flat at 1.1x on an LTM adjusted EBITDA basis as of Q1. I'd note this remains below the midpoint of our 1.0 to 1.5x net leverage target.\nMoving on to Slide #10, we provide an overview of cash generation and balance sheet data.

This combination resulted in our net leverage ratio remaining relatively flat at 1.1x on an LTM adjusted EBITDA basis as of Q1. I'd note this remains below the midpoint of our 1.0 to 1.5x net leverage target.\nAs we look ahead, we expect free cash flow for the full year to be similar to our previous expectation, but with a more back half-weighted cadence. This is a function of higher cash tax payments in Q1 and Q2, which we expect to step down in Q3. Our balance sheet strength will enable continued investment in the business as well as returns to shareholders via share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. At the end of Q1, we had $271 million in remaining authorization. Notably, we're pleased that our Board of Directors just approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which is the largest in company history. Our commitment to return capital to shareholders is evidenced by a $0.32 per share dividend, representing 10% year-over-year growth as well as our meaningful increase in share repurchase activity in the first quarter. We plan to continue repurchasing our shares at what we consider to be an aggressive pace in Q2.\nAs we look ahead, we expect free cash flow for the full year to be similar to our previous expectation, but with a more back half-weighted cadence.

We reiterate our fiscal '25 outlook for adjusted net revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14% and reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range from $5.80 to $6.20 to a new range of $5.85 to $6.20 to reflect good first quarter performance as well as our lower share count expectations. The midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS would indicate over 14% growth year-over-year and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA indicates approximately 15% growth year-over-year, highlighting our continued positive outlook for the business this year.\nFinally, please turn to Slide 11.

We anticipate revenue will rise sequentially through year-end with a more pronounced step-up between Q2 and Q3. Regarding margins, we ended up seeing a greater-than-expected benefit from the Christmas holiday timing that shifted some profitability forward. As a result, we now anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be below that of Q1. However, we continue to have good line of sight to reaching our 13.8% to 14% margin guidance for the full year and expect to see a nice step up in margins as we head into the second half of the year.\nTo assist with your modeling, I will quickly highlight a few items related to fiscal '25.

We took a somewhat conservative view to our FX in our original forecast. And as a result, we aren't seeing a significant incremental headwind today. However, should the dollar strengthen from here, that would have an adverse translation effect on revenue and operating income.\nLastly, we are monitoring FX movement, particularly conversation rates for the British pound.

Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada, Special Adviser to the CEO, Kevin Berryman; as well as our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and then summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics. Venk will then provide a review of our balance sheet and cash flow and provide comments around our guidance and Investor Day. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks and then we will open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I will turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Ayan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I'm joined today by my special adviser, Kevin Berryman, who acted as Interim CFO into June and will therefore report our financials. I'm delighted to also welcome our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni, on his first earnings call for Jacobs. Venk joined us in June and will provide details on guidance. Venk brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise from his 30-plus year career, and I am excited to work in partnership with him moving forward. Kevin will continue in his role as special adviser to me to drive a successful conclusion to the separation and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses with the Amentum. I'd like to extend my gratitude for Kevin for our ongoing support.\nNow moving to Slide 4. We continue to make progress on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value, higher-margin portfolio and remain confident in driving margin expansion over the coming years.\nTurning to Slide 5. I am pleased to report significant progress on the previously announced planned spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses. An updated Form-10 was publicly filed yesterday for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing made under Amazon Holdco, Inc. includes important business and financial information about the intended merger with Amentum to create a leading publicly traded global government services provider. Amentum will provide additional details during their Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. The transaction is now anticipated to be completed in the second half of September 2024.\nTurning to Slide 6 and Q3. I will now share our third quarter achievements, highlighted by strong backlog growth, consolidated margin expansion and P&PS record backlog and strong adjusted operating margin. This period saw a continuation of a mix shift to higher-margin science-based consulting and advisory services that offers significantly higher returns, contributing to an overall margin expansion, notably led by P&PS and our partnership with PA Consulting. We are seeing an accelerating demand for critical infrastructure, particularly in water, environmental and advanced facilities end markets, which are poised for substantial growth.\nConsolidated backlog increased 6% year-over-year bolstering confidence that our business will accelerate profitable growth as we strategically shift our portfolio to higher value, higher margin solutions. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA came in at $392 million, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period last year and representing 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin.\nFrom a cash perspective, we started the second half of the year by delivering very strong operating cash flow of $483 million and free cash flow of $445 million. We continue to expect exceeding 100% reported free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024, underscoring the power of our business model.\nTurning to Slide 7. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another -- of solid top line growth, along with strong adjusted operating margins of 15.3% and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% year-on-year. We ended Q3 with a strong book-to-bill of 1.53x and record backlog. Adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS -- solid P&PS organic revenue growth for Q4 fiscal year '24.\nI'm particularly pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins in core sectors such as water, environmental and advanced facilities, a testament to our robust market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We achieved double-digit growth in our water and environmental markets with 2/3 of our water-related business focused in on high-value science-based consulting and advisory services, driven by aging infrastructure and emerging PFAS regulations. Water continues to be a foundational element of our portfolio, exemplified by key wins across various geographies, reinforcing our global leadership in the sector.\nEurope, particularly the U.K., has shown resilience, posting a robust quarter in water-related awards. In Asia, we were appointed by [ UCB ], Singapore's national water agency to engineer and program manage the new crane water reclamation plant designed to enhance Northern Singapore's water treatment capacity by 120 million in -- gallons per day. Additionally, our partnership with [ Gonadega County ], the [ Syracuse Metrocon ] area in Central New York, which began in 2008, continues as they've chosen us to provide program management services for their efforts in controlling increased combined sewer outflow and utilizes our digital one water solutions. This expansion will be critical in remediating aging water infrastructure and supporting industrial growth in the geography.\nWe're excited by the continued momentum in pipeline build in our advanced facilities portfolio, predominantly driven by life sciences, semiconductor manufacturing and AI chip driven data center expansion. Specifically in life sciences, we continue to see robust growth with our pipeline and revenue growing double digits year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of our life sciences related business is concentrated in high-value science-based consulting and advisory services.\nWe were selected by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies to support the $1.2 billion expansion of their large-scale biologics facility -- biologics manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina, providing engineering, procurement and program management services with the first phase of construction expected to complete in 2025.\nWe continue to see a growing pipeline in transportation and energy and power supported by ongoing government stimulus. As an example, in transportation, we were selected to provide program management services for Broward County Transportation Department's first-ever public transit expansion. This $4.4 billion 30-year initiative will transform the transportation infrastructure into a -- modal transit system with a new light rail connecting Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport to -- Everglades. Additionally, the quarter was highlighted by several key wins in the energy and sustainability space as demonstrated by our appointment as program manager for the [ Arcus Hydrogen Consortium ] and master service agreement with Shell Energy in Australia.\nPA Consulting delivered an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 21.8% with robust execution and cost discipline. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator in our science-based consulting and advisory services. Together with PA, we were selected in the [ Hertfordshire County ] U.K. to enhance the public highways network in the county with services valued at approximately $22 million annually. This collaboration focuses on sustainability and aims to deliver long-term value over an initial 5-year period with potential extensions up to 14 years.\nIn Divergent Solutions, we are encouraged by the ongoing demand for our digitally enabled infrastructure solutions that will remain with independent Jacobs post close. A testament to our capabilities is our recent selection by the City of Omaha to develop a data analytics and AI-enabled support system for its wastewater network, utilizing Jacobs Digital One Water Solutions, Aqua DNA. CMS delivered 35 basis points of margin expansion, the highest in 10 quarters and has a strong pipeline. Additionally, we're experiencing encouraging trends that support long-term growth as we approach the merger with Amentum.\nIn summary, we remain confident in our ability to win higher value, higher-margin solutions and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q3 results, leading to another solid quarter. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 8. Third quarter gross revenue grew 1% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue also grew 1%. GAAP operating profit was $260 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $73 million of transaction, restructuring and other costs including $62 million associated with the separation transaction. We now expect our total restructuring costs to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by higher separation transaction costs associated with our anticipated close now targeted during the second half of September 2024.\nOur adjusted operating margin was again a strong 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.17 per share and included a $0.31 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.49 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.96, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA was $392 million and was up 11% year-over-year, representing an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. Finally, consolidated backlog was up 6% year-over-year and the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.29x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 5.5% year-over-year.\nRegarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 9. Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year with adjusted operating profit up 12%. Our mix shift mentioned earlier, resulted in higher margins on lower revenue growth. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% was up 95 basis points year-over-year. Our backlog grew by 10% year-over-year, while gross profit in backlog were 9%. This quarter's critical wins underscore our strength in water, environmental and advanced facilities, reinforcing our leadership position in these key markets. These wins translated into a book-to-bill of 1.53x and a record backlog, as previously mentioned by Bob.\nMoving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q3 revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, while backlog was up 4%. Excluding the announced contract loss mentioned in the prior quarter, our revenue would have been up slightly year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit was at 1.2% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 35 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%, the highest margin in 10 quarters as the business continues to drive operational improvements and margin-enhancing client-facing projects.\nShifting to Divergent Solutions. Q3 saw an 11% year-over-year dip in adjusted net revenue and a 40% year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating profit, driven by a onetime year-to-date government rate adjustment and the space-based ISR program delays that were mentioned in the prior quarter. Despite the strategic shift in funding with the DoD, we continue to see positive momentum in our space-based ISR technology adoption linked to pipeline build and expected future backlog growth.\nNow let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q3 saw a modest increase in year-over-year revenue. However, PA delivered a strong adjusted operating margin of 21.8%, reflecting a 60 basis point improvement from the previous year. Our margin results this quarter exceeded our expectations and reinforces our confidence in sustaining a strong margin profile as we continue to expect 20% plus margins in Q4. Backlog increased 4% year-over-year, and we expect improved growth as we enter fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $61 million in Q3, and we continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model to drive costs down.\nFinally, I am very excited to welcome Venk to the team. We've been working together closely and I -- and we have made great progress on ensuring a smooth transition.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Venk.\n\nVenkatesh R. Nathamuni\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Kevin. Let me begin by saying I'm very excited to be part of the Jacobs team and a special thanks to Kevin for his partnership and support. I'll now provide a quick overview of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics, followed by consolidated full year guidance.\nTurning to Slide 10. We posted a strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. We generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $445 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow conversion was well above 100%, leading to a full year expectation of greater than 100%.\nRegarding capital allocation We opportunistically repurchased $151 million of shares during the quarter, which was up $55 million compared to Q2, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We have $528 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we've stated before, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion and our Q3 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.1x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt remaining current in the fiscal year. We have ample options, refinancing as well as using proceeds from the expected separation transaction for repaying the current amounts. As of the end of Q3, approximately 37% of our debt was tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. On the dividend front, we remain committed to growing our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29 and 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on August '23.\nNow turning to Slide 11. Given the solid execution thus far, we're narrowing our consolidated adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $7.85 to $8.05, representing 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of the $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion range. This guidance incorporates Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.96 and approximately 27% adjusted effective tax rate for the remainder of this fiscal year. Additionally, this represents 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year-ago period.\nOur expectation is that the ongoing positive momentum in our business will lead to increased revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 compared to our current levels. Once we close the separation transaction, we anticipate an immediate shift in our company's growth profile, positioning us solidly for higher growth higher margins.\nAs Bob mentioned earlier, the anticipated separation transaction close date is now in the second half of September 2024. The -- as a result, we expect Q3 to be the last quarter in which the results of the separated businesses will be included in our continuing operations. Beginning this quarter, we expect our results for our continuing operations to reflect the new independent Jacobs. Historical results for independent Jacobs will be available following the close of the transaction. And lastly, we're excited to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day for independent Jacobs on February 18, 2025, in Miami, Florida. We look forward to sharing our long-term strategy as well as our financial target model with the investor community during this event. Additional details will be forthcoming, and we look forward to your participation.\nAnd with that, now I'll turn the call back to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Venk. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digital digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market, and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. ."

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Jacobs Engineering's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ayan Banerjee, Senior Vice President, Finance, Treasury, Investor Relations, and Corporate Development. Ayan, you may begin your conference.\n\nAyan Banerjee\n\nThank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and operating metrics.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and interim CFO, Kevin Berryman. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. With that, I will turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Ayan, and good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I want to welcome Kevin Berryman, previously our President and Chief Financial Officer back, following his appointment as interim CFO. Kevin brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, having served as our CFO for over 9 years.\nDuring his tenure, he played a pivotal role in navigating significant transformation and growth across our organization, and most recently, has demonstrated exceptional leadership in overseeing the ongoing separation of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses as well as its planned strategic merger with Amentum. As we move forward, we have initiated a search for a permanent CFO with the assistance of an executive search firm. We are working towards concluding this search expeditiously and are grateful that Kevin has agreed to remain at Jacobs through the close of the separation transaction, to provide overlap with our next CFO and ensure a smooth transition.\nNow moving to Slide 4. I want to emphasize our solid progress on the cost optimization plan. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure, expanding margin, and accelerating profitable growth across our lines of business. Our strategic shift towards a less complex, higher-value and higher-margin portfolio remains on track. We are actively identifying opportunities to streamline our operating model and enhance efficiency while continuing to deliver world-class, value-added, scientific-based, digitally-enabled solutions to create a more connected and sustainable world.\nWe have made significant progress on our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence separation planning. We're pleased to report that we have now achieved a significant milestone by receiving all approvals and clearances under competition and foreign direct investment laws that are conditioned to the separation transaction. We are steadily advancing our Form 10 filing targeted for early summer. We expect to fulfill the remaining closing conditions and complete the transaction in the second half of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nTurning to Slide 5 and Q2. I'm pleased to report solid second quarter consolidated revenue driven by 5% growth and 3% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year and gross margin and backlog increased approximately 50 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our business will continue to deliver profitable growth.\nTurning to Slide 6. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another quarter of solid top line growth as we continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth, as demonstrated by P&PS record adjusted operating margin of 15.3% and strong adjusted operating profit growth of 15.3% year-on-year. We continue to drive organic revenue growth up 7.5% and adjusted up 5.6% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust and we continue to expect P&PS organic revenue growth of mid- to high single digits in FY '24.\nDuring the quarter, we have delivered several marquee wins across multiple core market sectors. In transportation, we have been selected as Amtrak's delivery partner for the $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program, America's busiest passenger railroad, one of the largest national transportation and infrastructure investments and the most significant IIJA award to date. The team will provide program and construction management services from contract initiation through service commissioning for 2 high tunnel tubes for electrified passenger trains, improving rail systems and enhancing accessibility to transform this 10-mile section of the Northeast Corridor.\nPA Consulting is an integral part of our program management team, demonstrating their emerging presence in transport in the U.S. and the power of our collaborative partnership. In aviation, we continue our long-term relationship with Los Angeles World Airports to provide program management services at Los Angeles International Airport. Infrastructure improvements at LAX will enhance the city's preparedness for upcoming sporting events, including the Los Angeles '28 Olympics.\nWater remains a critical growth catalyst with several strategic wins across our key geographies, further bolstering our position in the sector as evidenced by our appointment by Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department to design upgrades for the county's 3 wastewater treatment plants, benefiting nearly 2.4 million residents and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Jacobs will incorporate intelligent O&M, a digital one-water solution from its suite of digital products to provide our confident decision-making and to achieve greater efficiencies, reducing wastewater treatment costs and optimizing operational labor.\nAdditionally, we were selected by United Utilities, one of the U.K.'s largest listed water companies, to its strategic solutions team supporting program optimization from major capital works through the AMP8 and AMP9 cycles, which cover the period from 2025 to 2035. Furthermore, we were selected by Water Corporation, the largest water utility in Western Australia, to design, build, operate, and maintain the Alkimos Seawater Desalination plant in Perth, Australia. The project, part of an alliance with Water Corporation and ACCIONA, is expected to ultimately produce 26 billion gallons of drinking water.\nIn recent weeks, significant regulatory steps have been taken in the environmental sector. The U.S. EPA set maximum contaminant levels for 5 PFAS compounds, the first major U.S. drinking water legislation in 20 years, and classified 2 PFAS compounds as hazardous under the Superfund program, expanding our potential for environmental management and compliance services. Internationally, the EU has also progressed, banning certain PFAS compounds and moving forward with risk evaluations. These developments are expected to increase demand for our consulting, engineering, and remediation services. We've been working with and advising our clients about how these anticipated regulations will impact them as discussions began some years ago. Now that the regulations are finalized, we're having robust conversations with our clients about their options to navigate this next chapter.\nPA Consulting is working with companies that have PFAS materials in their products and advising on how to remove them from their products and supply chains as well as assessing how to create alternative materials. With our expertise, strong market presence, and leading position as demonstrated by our ongoing work with the Department of Defense, U.K. government and Australian aviation authorities, Jacobs is ready to lead in this evolving space.\nIn life sciences, our overall pipeline continues to grow at double-digit rates year-over-year, driven by long-term relationships. There are significant opportunities in the pipeline and we are well positioned for continued growth. In CMS, Q2 revenue was up 3% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit increased 10% with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. The CMS team is executing well, and we continue to see several positive trends for long-term growth as the team prepares for the merger with Amentum.\nPA Consulting delivered among an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 20.5% with solid execution and cost discipline. We continue to expect the remaining quarters in FY '24 to exceed 20% adjusted operating margin. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator for us with some nice wins in the quarter, including the previously mentioned Frederick Douglass Tunnel and an appointment to the HM Revenue and Customs multibillion-pound framework in the U.K., intended to upgrade software systems across the government agency.\nDivergent Solutions delivered a solid adjusted operating margin performance at approximately 10% and adjusted operating profit growth, which would have been approximately 13% excluding a large license sale to Palantir in the comparison period. Our suite of digital products and platforms are elevating the value we can provide to our clients globally. In summary, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our core market sectors. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q2 results, leading to another strong quarter. We are steadfast in our commitment to providing high-value solutions with improved margins, supported by our continued emphasis on operational excellence and execution, so let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7.\nSecond quarter gross revenue grew 5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating profit was $281 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $58 million of transaction, restructuring and other costs including $47 million associated with the separation transaction. We still expect our total restructuring cost to be approximately $275 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by the separation transaction.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.28 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.34 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, all of which were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.91, marking a 7% decrease compared to the previous year. When adjusting for last year's second quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.32, our current non-GAAP EPS represents an approximately 10% year-over-year increase.\nLooking forward, we anticipate maintaining an annual effective tax rate of 22% for the full fiscal year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing a strong 11.3% adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 2% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.96x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 4% year-over-year. Excluding a onetime change in government funding strategy with regard to space ISR programs, which I'll describe in more detail during my segment comments, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been approximately 1.06x, with significant strength in pipeline growth and expected large wins in Q3 and Q4.\nRegarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8. We are particularly pleased with our performance in People & Places Solutions. Q2 adjusted net revenue was up 5.6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit growth was strong at 15.3%. Reflecting our commitment to higher-end profitable growth, the segment saw a record adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business. Our backlog has grown by 2% year-over-year, and we've seen a 7% increase in the gross profit in our backlog. This improvement reflects our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our bids and project wins as we expect some critical large wins to occur in Q3.\nMoving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q2 revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year with backlog up 3.9%. Our adjusted operating profit was up 10.3% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year as the business continued to find avenues of operational improvements. While a recent program loss will put some short-term pressure on the second half, our recent successes in shorter-cycle awards is expected to help mitigate the impact. Our work remains mission-critical, allowing the business to show long-term resilience against shifts in government funding and program adjustments.\nLet's now focus on Divergent Solutions. During Q2, we observed an 11% year-over-year decrease in adjusted net revenue and 24% decrease year-over-year in adjusted operating profit. Excluding a onetime Palantir license in the previous period, adjusted operating profit would have been up 13% year-over-year. While backlog was negatively impacted by a change in funding strategy with the DoD on space-based ISR programs, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in near-term sales, which we believe will contribute to our ongoing success.\nNow let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q2 saw a slight decline of 2% in year-over-year revenue, driven by a continued challenging macro environment in the consulting industry and a solid year ago comparable. However, cost and execution discipline helped deliver a strong adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, a 270 basis point increase from the previous sequential quarter. As we emphasized during our last earnings call, our industry position is uniquely differentiated and our work is both purposeful and critical. As a result, PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline growth.\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted operating profit margins targeting above 20% for the second half of the year. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q2. We continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model and driving costs down. We expect this line item post separation to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually.\nTurning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. After delivering a strong free cash flow in Q1, our quarterly free cash flow was negative $71 million in Q2 as working capital increased the planned levels from the exceptional performance in Q1. Despite this impact in the second quarter, our reported free cash flow conversion for the first half of the year has remained at approximately 100%. And as a result, we are well positioned to deliver on our forecast, maintaining 100% reported as well as adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full year.\nRegarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $95 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We still have $679 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and gross debt of $3 billion. Our Q2 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.3x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet.\nGiven the strength of the balance sheet, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt having become current in Q2. We have ample options: refinancing, using proceeds from our upcoming separation transaction, and/or accessing our revolver. As of the end of Q2, approximately 37% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and year-to-date free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29, an 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on June 21. Bob, back over to you.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives. As a result, we are narrowing the range for fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion, and adjusted EPS to $7.80 to $8.10, representing a 9% and 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.91 and a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, this represents a 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year ago period.\nIn closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market. And we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Evans, VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Evans\n\nThank you, Audra. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics.\nWe have also introduced a new supplement that consolidates certain information, including our non-GAAP financial tables. Additionally, beginning with this quarter, the company will no longer apply an adjustment to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS, which previously resulted in the application of the expected annual tax rate to all quarterly periods. Prior comparable periods are also being presented on this basis.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO; Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our first quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth and margin expansion across our lines of business. .\nOur team continues to demonstrate great resilience and dedication as we delivered better-than-expected underlying results in Q1, while also working to the added task of standing up 2 independent companies. At the corporate level, we are diligently working to create a leaner operating model that aligns Jacobs' position as a global leader in delivering science-based digitally enabled solutions to our clients. And allowing us to benefit fully from the broad-based strength that we see in global infrastructure and sustainability investments.\nWe are confident that our actions we are taking are providing the foundation for multiyear improvement in profitability and margins, and we look forward to sharing more detail in the quarters to come.\nTurning to Slide 4. I want to provide a brief update on a few key milestones related to the spin-off and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions in Cyber and Intelligence businesses with momentum. We continue to progress towards closing of the transaction in the second half of fiscal year 2024, consistent with our previous expectations. Together with momentum, we are making progress on preparing our Form 10 and private letter rooming request in keeping with the established time line of the transaction.\nAdditionally, we are progressing antitrust filings and regulatory approvals. Upon the public filing of the Form 10, we aim to offer more comprehensive information and look forward to introducing the combined leadership team to our investors and analysts later this spring.\nI would also like to briefly touch on the cost optimization plan that we outlined last quarter. Our transformation to a less followable and higher-margin portfolio is well underway. We continue to find new ways to streamline our operating model. And while it is too early to positively revise our targets, we are increasingly confident in our ability to enhance our long-term profitability. As we progress towards separation and optimizing our corporate cost structure, we now are able to better align costs to the applicable business units.\nAs a result, we have made the decision to shift some corporate unallocated costs into the current P&PS segment, which will allow for greater long-term recovery of our corporate overhead. While this has the effect of temporarily weighing on our segment operating margins, this has no impact on our bottom line today. Rather, this will boost corporate profitability in the long run as we gradually recover cost from public sector clients. Providing upside beyond the initial 13.8% adjusted EBITDA margin target set for stand-alone Jacobs, post separation that we shared last quarter. This adds to our conviction that our transformation will drive multiyear value creation.\nTurning to Slide 5. In Q1, I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter revenue driven by 9.5% gross and 7.9% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 5% year-over-year, and gross margin in backlog improved 29 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our businesses can continue their profitable growth trends.\nThis quarter's results include a onetime noncash $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding this item, adjusted operating profit would have increased versus the prior year period. We saw a continuation of strong organic growth in P&PS with 8.4% adjusted net revenue growth. We had a Q1 operating cash flow of $418 million, up 38% year-over-year. Strong cash conversion is a hallmark of our asset-light business model and remain robust in Q1 with $401 million in free cash flow, and we expect to generate greater than 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024. The ultimate matter of our ability to create value is long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that will continue to be our North Star.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our People & Places line of business generated strong top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 8.4% year-over-year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 6% organic growth. We continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth as demonstrated by gross profit and backlog increasing 7% year-over-year.\nOur pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic growth of mid- to high single digits in FY '24. We -- we anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.\nThe water market remains to be a pacesetter within the company. In particular, Water scarcity continues to trend across the globe, affecting billions of people. Decades of increasing population growth and agricultural demand have significantly depleted the quantity and quality of water resources. Jacobs is a leader in developing solutions to address water scarcity, including water reuse, groundwater management and desalinization.\nIn the Americas, California and Colorado have recently adopted regulations for direct potable reuse. And Arizona is making positive strides towards adopting similar regulations. Notably, the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, is currently building a new semiconductor facility in Arizona. We've been selected for the first phase of the design and project delivery of the campuses industrial reclaimed water plants. In addition, multiple states in the U.S. are developing regional water supply plans to balance water availability and economic growth. As an example of such work, we were awarded a $191 million project in St. Johns County, Florida for the design and project delivery of a water reclamation facility.\nThis facility will 3.25 million gallons of water daily for beneficial reuse with 13 miles of transitioning pipelines to deliver reclaimed water for resident central irrigation.\nIn transportation, we have a long-term relationship with Brightline West and have been awarded the design of the 218-mile high-speed rail link in Las Vegas to Southern California. Brightline West through a partnership with Nevada successfully secured $3 billion in grants from the Federal Railroad Administration as part of the IGA funding.\nIn Life Sciences, we're supporting [indiscernible] with permitting and conceptual design for their injectable manufacturing facility in [indiscernible] Germany, to support an increased demand for their medicines, including their diabetes and obesity portfolio.\nWe continue to secure additional large engagements in the Middle East. For example [indiscernible] been appointed to provide preliminary and detail design and supervision services for utility and road infrastructure, including major road upgrades for Wadi Safar and Diriyah Gate 2 in Saudi Arabia.\nIn CMS, we performed very well in Q1, continuing the profitability trend demonstrated in FY '23. CMS's Q1 revenue was up 5% over year and operating profit increased 14% behind 63 basis points of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remains strong with major award prospects in FY '24 and a light recompete schedule. The CMS team is executing well and has great momentum as they prepare to be an independent company.\nPA Consulting continues to take share as demonstrated by a 8.5% revenue growth in what continues to be a choppy macro environment, particularly in the U.K. Margins were light due to some softness in December. However, we continue to expect approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year and have confidence in our ability to manage variable costs to achieve that goal.\nTogether with PA, we celebrated new wins with the office of gas and electricity markets in the U.K. for program management services and regulatory practices that will advance the safe and secure supply of hydrogen.\nOur diverged Solutions operating unit delivered a solid quarter with 5% adjusted net revenue growth. Profits were impacted by an approximately $15 million onetime in connection with the merger. Underlying performance in the business was strong and excluded this write-down. Adjusted operating margins would have been approximately 700 basis points higher and exceeded our expectations for the quarter.\nIn summary, we remain well positioned to grow while serving our clients with excellence and delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions for a more connected and sustainable world. And we continue generating strong free cash flow conversion, which will enable us to return capital to shareholders as we chart our new path forward as two independent companies.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nClaudia Jaramillo\n\nExecutive Vice President of Strategy & Corporate Development\n\nThank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which came in above our expectations. Our results illustrate our ability to deliver on our long-standing financial objectives, while at the same time, generating strong free cash flow and returning a significant portion of our cash to shareholders.\nSo let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. First quarter gross revenue grew 9.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit totaled $204 million for the quarter and included $51 million of amortization for acquired intangibles and $16 million of oil transaction, separation related restructuring and other costs. This includes $51 million associated with the separation of CMS. Our adjusted operating margin was 9.8%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reported segment review.\nTop EPS from continuing operations was $1.37 per share. And included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.37 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, First quarter adjusted EPS was $2.02, up 28% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS included a $0.49 benefit related to a discrete tax item and a $0.09 headwind related to the noncash inventory write-down.\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA was $328 million and was down 3.1% year-over-year, representing 10% of our adjusted networking capital, excluding the inventory write-down, adjusted EBITDA would be roughly flat year-over-year. The effective tax rate was 4.2% benefited from $61.6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the permanent reinvestment of capital gains associated with an overseas subsidiary. This tax benefit was incorporated in our annual guidance and we continue to forecast the 22% annual effective tax rate to fiscal year 2024.\nWe will no longer be adjusting our non-GAAP EPS to align with our full year effective tax rate expectations. With the entirety of the deferred tax benefit in Q1, we now expect quarterly effective tax rate to approximate 26% to 27% for each quarter or the remainder of the fiscal year.\nFinally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just 1.12x, with our gross profit and backlog increasing 6.1% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our [indiscernible] business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8.\nStarting with People and Places Solutions. Q1 adjusted net revenue was up 8.4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was down slightly, resulting in adjusted operating margins of 13.7%. However, excluding the impact of cost allocation changes previously mentioned, adjusted operating profit would have resulted in approximately 7% year-over-year growth. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business and anticipates full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.\nMoving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q1 revenue increased 5% year-over-year with backlog up 9%. Continuing a consistent trend of high single-digit growth over multiple quarters. We also continue to find avenues through operational improvement with CMS operating margins rising by 63 basis points year-over-year.\nShifting to divergent solutions. In Q1, our adjusted net revenue increased by 4.7% year-over-year. Underlying execution was strong. Adjusted operating profit was $8 million, including the $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding the one-off write-down, performance was above expectations.\nNow let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q1 saw an 8.5% year-over-year revenue increase. PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline. However, the U.K.'s ongoing election cycle introduces macro risks that we are closely monitoring. We remain confident in our ability to navigate these factors by managing variable costs and are targeting approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year. In total, it was a strong quarter for each of our segments from an execution standpoint.\nOur adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q1. This quarter's cost excluded previously mentioned costs that are now being allocated to the P&PS segment. As we continue to enhance operational efficiencies and optimize our operating model we expect this line item to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually post debt pressure.\nTurning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted another quarter of strong cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. As Bob mentioned, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $401 million. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings.\nRegarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders. We still have $775 million remaining under last year's repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders in aligning with our overarching goal of compounding free cash flow per share.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.14 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion. Our Q1 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.2x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q1, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.1%.\nFinally, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized an 11.5% increase to $0.29 per quarter, and our quarterly dividend will be paid on March 22. With this, we have increased our dividends each year since 2018, driving a nearly 12% dividend CAGR over that period.\nNow I will turn it back to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to be energized as interest in our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains robust as clients engage Jacobs to solve their most complex challenges. Internally, we remain focused on execution and continuing to deliver against our operational and financial objectives. .\nWe reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.60 billion, with adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8. 20, representing 9% and 10% growth at midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.02 and as Claudia shared a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of this fiscal year.\nThough we expect a heavier than normal cost structure until separation, particularly in [indiscernible] , we anticipate accelerating EPS growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\nIn closing, we've maintained focus on standing up both independent Jacobs and CMS for success while streamlining and optimizing our operating model and positioning both companies for long-term value creation.\nOperator, we will now open the call for questions."

My name is Chibrow, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Evans\n\nThank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. Our 10-K will be filed later today. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our fourth quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Bob Pragada.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 business performance and 2024 outlook. Our team has shown remarkable strength, adaptability and dedication and continuing to deliver outstanding results to our clients. I am proud of our people for continuing to drive our culture of caring to new heights.\nOver the past couple of quarters, we have shared our intention to simplify our business model, optimize our cost structure and accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion. Today marks a key turning point as we boldly move forward. I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business on Slide 4, before I move on to our fourth quarter results. As we communicated, following a robust evaluation of all opportunities, we are excited to announce the creation of a new leading government services player. Jacobs will be separating our industry-leading government services businesses, Critical Mission Solutions and the Cyber & Intelligence unit of Divergent Solutions by the way of a spinoff to Jacobs shareholders and then combining those assets with Amentum through a merger, which has been structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. This combination is intended to be largely tax-free for Jacobs shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 5. The combination creates a combined government technology services leader with an approximately $13 billion in revenue and approximately $1.1 billion of combined adjusted EBITDA, including $50 million to $70 million of net synergies expected to be realized by year 2. Jacobs shareholders will own 51%, and Jacobs will retain a stake equal to between 7.5% to 12% of the combined company based on achievement of operating profit targets prior to close. Jacobs will also receive a $1 billion cash dividend, subject to customary adjustments as well as an additional value through the disposition of our retained within 12 months of closing. As part of our continued separation efforts, we concluded it was best to include the majority of our Divergent Solutions business, including the Cyber & Intelligence unit in the separation perimeter, owing to the strategic synergies, shared costs and operational overlap with CMS. We will retain the infrastructure-related software assets of divergence Solutions, given their strong strategic fit with our critical infrastructure, advanced facility and PA Consulting businesses. We believe this combination of 2 premium industry leaders who share strong operating platforms, high-performance culture and a breadth of expertise offer shareholders the best opportunity to realize long-term value. The combined business has the ability to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful cost synergies, added scale and diverse end market exposure and is supported by secular growth trends.\nAfter a comprehensive review of all inbound inquiries, we believe the transaction is in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Jacobs Board as well as the financial sponsors of Amentum, and is not subject to any other shareholder approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of fiscal year 2024 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. For more details regarding the structure of the deal, I invite you to review the materials we published earlier.\nMoving to Slide 6, which shows our multiyear transformational. As part of this strategic separation which results in a more focused Jacobs, we are concurrently announcing a cost optimization plan to be executed over the next 24 months. During which time, we will target over 300 basis points of margin expansion as compared to our as-reported fiscal year 2023 results, driving an expected adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025 for pro forma Jacobs. Claudia will share more details in her prepared remarks.\nPost transaction, Jacobs will be a well-capitalized pure play critical infrastructure and sustainability leader with a strong balance sheet and significant growth potential. Fiscal 2023 marked records for revenue and free cash flow generation for Jacobs, and we look forward to [ 2024 ] as we begin to chart our path forward as 2 leading independent companies.\nTurning to Slide 7 and Q4. I'm pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. I would like to once again reiterate that this growth is entirely organic. Strong cash conversion remains a hallmark of our business model and remained robust in Q4, allowing us to drive record fiscal year 2023 free cash flow in order to return capital to shareholders while investing behind our growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. We recorded 104% underlying free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income in FY 2023 on a record year of $837 million in free cash flow generation. We expect to generate greater than 100% underlying free cash flow conversion again in FY 2024 before the impact of restructuring, transaction and separation costs. Our underlying business and outlook remains very healthy, and we continue to be excited about robust growth opportunities in all our end markets.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 11% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit up 12% year-over-year. Claudia will provide further details on the significant growth we are experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see widespread positive indicators with a gross profit and backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Once again, our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth can persist at mid- to high single digits organically in FY '24.\nLooking back at FY '23, I want to highlight the significant achievements of our P&PS business with double-digit organic OP growth in every quarter. Water continues to be a pillar of our business. Of the top 30 wins in the quarter, 9 were in the water sector. Of those wins, we wanted to highlight 2 that showcase our digital and data capabilities. Firstly, at the city of Farmington, New Mexico wastewater and surface water treatment plant, our data-enabled product, Aqua, is a key part of the solution to provide resiliency efforts and improve energy efficiency. Secondly, for Boston Water and Sewer Commission, we are leveraging our AI model that analyzes the assets that are most likely to fail, helping our clients create data-driven maintenance and replacement plans. In the energy transition space, Jacobs has been selected as the program manager for the [indiscernible] $2.85 billion effort to decarbonize its steel mill in Duisburg, Germany. with a new green hydrogen power plant. The site is Europe's largest steel mill and the effort represents one of the largest industrial decarbonization projects worldwide. It is also a testament to the diversity of our expertise.\nIn transportation, our largest market, we continue to see broad-based momentum from IIJA related funding. Overall, IIJA-related pipeline has increased approximately 20% year-over-year. In Q4, we were selected lead and manage 10-year renovation of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport International terminal, emphasizing upgrades to enhanced mobility and energy efficiency to position Seattle as a global tourism and business hub. Internationally, we continue to see high levels of activity in the Middle East. For example, in climate response, we are providing program management services to the Saudia Arabia National Center for Environmental Compliance. The work forms part of their ongoing environmental remediation program to prepare damage to terrestrial and coastal environment. Our environmental expertise is truly global, and we continue to see a robust opportunity set related to our clients' climate-related challenges.\nIn CMS, we performed very well in Q4 to cap off a great year. CMS Q4 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year, and operating profit increased 26% behind 128 bps of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in FY 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete suits. CMS was awarded a new project management resources framework contract with EDF Nuclear Generation licensee of 8 nuclear power stations, which account for approximately 16% of the U.K.'s electricity output.\nPA Consulting continues to post strong results with 13% revenue growth and nearly 21% operating profit margins despite a very challenging macro environment. While we remain cognizant of the weakness that some consulting peers are seeing, we continue to be pleased with strong operational performance delivered by the PA team. Utilization has improved and during Q4, PA announced the appointment of Christian as its new CEO. Christian formally led PA's Life Sciences unit as a respected leader both internally and externally and has creative ideas to take the Jacobs partnership with PA to new heights. For example, the power of our relationship is driving further opportunities as evidenced in our recent award to the Copenhagen Metro framework. Together with PA, we are bringing our enterprise digital tools, AI solutions and deep knowledge of the rail sector to support the Copenhagen Metro as it continues to deliver modern future-ready structure to meet the city's fast-growing population and urban travel demand.\nOur Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 58% year-over-year growth in operating profit. In Divergent, we are a leader in space innovation with the introduction of [ Mango ] 2, a revolutionary radio frequency signal detection system that utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine learning analytics, emphasizing affordability. An example of the leading IP portfolio that reinforces independent CMS as a formidable player in the space arena.\nTurning to Slide 9. In summary, we are extremely well positioned for growth across all the sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record of operational excellence. We are excited to turn the page on this next chapter in Jacobs' history where we will be creating 2 leading independent companies.\nLooking to Slide 10. Independent Jacobs is a leader in the majority of sectors in which we operate and a global leader in the overall industry. With today's announcement, we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to further simplify our fit structure, optimize our cost base and accelerate growth and margin improvement in the quarters and years ahead.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nClaudia Jaramillo\n\nExecutive Vice President of Strategy & Corporate Development\n\nThank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 11 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 8.9%. GAAP operating profit was $278 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, $43 million of other transactions separate -- related restructuring costs and $11 million noncash charge related to decrease in our real estate footprint. The other transaction relation related and restructuring costs of $43 million are primarily related to advisory and other costs associated with the separation of CMS. As we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the separation.\nLooking to fiscal year 2024, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in onetime costs related to the separation and associated cost optimization actions. These costs are largely unavoidable in a separation and transactions of this size, but I want to reiterate that post-separation, it will be a key focus of ours to minimize onetime adjustments inclusive of restructuring costs.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 11%, up 14 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.25 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired tangibles; $0.23 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs; a $0.05 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint and a $0.10 adjustment to align to our annual adjusted effective tax rate. I refer you to Slide 30 for more details on these adjustments.\nExcluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.90, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $384 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing 11.1% of adjusted net revenue. The company's U.S. GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations is 21% for the fiscal year 2023. Our U.S. GAAP and adjusted effect tax rate for the quarter and year include certain tax charges for deferred tax valuation allowances and audit assessment. In the fourth quarter, these amounted to an EPS impact of $0.06 per share. And as a result, fiscal year 2023 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects a 21.6% adjusted effective tax rate. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 8% year-over-year.\nMoving to Slide 12 for a brief recap of our full year 2023 performance. Fiscal year gross revenue grew 10% year-over-year, and net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up significantly year-over-year, driven primarily by strong growth in gross profit, withholding G&A relatively flat. GAAP EPS was $5.31, and adjusted EPS was $7.20, up 7% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. Adjusted operating profit grew 9% and was up 11% on a constant currency basis. Both revenue and adjusted operating profit increased year-over-year in all of our business segments. Operating profit margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.8%, driven by strong underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.44 billion, up 5% and up 7% in constant currency. As a percentage of adjusted net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%. We expect modest adjusted operating margin expansion in fiscal 2024, driven by a combination of a higher margin revenue mix and lower corporate G&A. However, we expect an even greater uplift in margins post-separation as we streamline our operating model and cost structure. On a trailing 12-month basis, fiscal year 2023 book-to-bill was approximately 1.1x.\nRegarding the performance of our lines of business, let's turn to Slide 13 for Q4 performance and 14 for full year performance. Starting with People & Places Solutions. P&PS continues to see solid momentum delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 adjusted net revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Growth was consistently strong across all business units. Europe rebounded positively after being our weakest region year-to-date, and we saw continued strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was relatively flat sequentially, although gross margin in backlog was up 8% year-over-year as we continue to focus on improving business quality. The P&PS Q4 operating profit was up 12%, driven by strong growth, maintaining healthy gross margins and solid G&A management resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 15%, up 16 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, adjusted operating profit was up 16% and adjusted operating margins were 14.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year.\nOur P&PS Americas unit, which is our largest by revenue, benefited from legislative drivers and a healthy state and local budgets continuing to propel client spending. Internationally, Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be bright spots in the portfolio supported by [indiscernible] and strategic water pursuits. Additionally, our European business showed a positive sequential growth.\nNow moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q4 revenue was up 7% year-over-year, and backlog is up 8% year-over-year, and the business continues to demonstrate a strong win rate against a very healthy pipeline in all of its core focus areas. CMS operating margins were up 128 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, margins were roughly flat, while operating profit increased 6% year-over-year. Notably, margins continued to rebound throughout the year as forecasted.\nMoving to Divergent Solutions. Adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q4 as we remain focused on portfolio improvement. We expect growth to accelerate from year-end levels as investments mature and lower-margin contracts roll out of backlog. Operating margins for the quarter was up 10.1% -- was 10.1%, a 50 basis point sequential improvement.\nTurning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 13% year-over-year in Q4 and increased 4% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. Based on booking trends, we expect revenue growth to show a positive trend in fiscal year 2024 while remaining cautious of the macro risk as the U.K. goes through an election site. PA's Q4 operating profit was 20.6%, up 122 basis points year-over-year and up 21% year-over-year. Utilization continues to improve, and we expect operating margins to be over 20% for the medium term. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q4, roughly flat sequentially and consistent with our guidance. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model. However, despite initial cost actions taken, we will carry temporary costs associated with supporting the entirety of Jacobs, including the businesses to be separated. We estimate that we are carrying approximately $40 million in temporary cost throughout this transition period. This allows us the opportunity to reinforce our commitment to our clients and enhanced business resilience. We are confident that these efforts will contribute to a stronger foundation and continued excellence in serving our clients as 2 leading independent companies.\nTurning to Slide 15 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings. Operating cash flow was $219 million and free cash flow was $180 million. As a result, we were able to deliver above our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the year with 104% underlying cash conversion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders for a total of $480 million through both share repurchases and dividends. Though we were unable to repurchase shares in the quarter due to the CMS separation, we utilize cash flow to strategically pay down floating rate debt, ensuring a more robust financial position for the future. This disciplined approach aligns with our commitment to long-term financial stability and value creation for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with cash of $927 million and gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in just over $1.9 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile, both today and as a more focused business, post our announced CMS separation.\nIn August, we completed the offering of $600 million in senior unsecured notes due to 2028 with a fixed rate of 6.35%. This allowed us to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of the end of Q4, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail on our debt and quarterly interest expense.\nGiven our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. On November 9, we paid a $0.26 dividend, representing a 13% year-over-year increase.\nFinally, I wanted to highlight our cost optimization plan shared on Slide 16. We recognize that our cost structure is high. And we see opportunities to optimize in the coming quarters and post CMS separation. We have identified over $90 million in run rate savings, including lower corporate and allocated costs to the specific measures that we are starting to action. We expect to reduce our corporate unallocated costs from around $60 million per quarter to approximately $50 million per quarter including full elimination of stranded costs post separation. We are streamlining our operating model with an eye towards positioning us for growth and cost efficiency while staying focused on our clients. While we will not yet comment on long-term growth and margin expectations beyond our 2025 strategic plan, we believe we can deliver over 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from fiscal 2023 as reported margins to fiscal 2025 for standalone Jacobs. This results in an expected adjusted EBITDA margins for stand-alone Jacobs of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025. This is a bold undertaken as it is our longer-term aspiration to deliver best-in-class industry margins.\nIn closing, Bob and I are committed to 3 things over the next few quarters. First, driving efficiencies in our business and maximizing our profitability as demonstrated by the margin targets. Second, position in our business with the financial resources needed for multiyear free cash flow growth. Third, strengthening discipline and deploying our shareholder capital. Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 16. As we discussed throughout our remarks, we remain committed to accelerating robust growth opportunities ahead for all businesses. Given today's global macro uncertainty, that strength is more relevant than ever as we plan for the future as 2 independent companies. It's crucial to emphasize that the underlying fundamentals of our business have never been stronger.\nTurning to fiscal year '24 outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion with an adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing a 9% and 10% and growth at the midpoint, respectively. This outlook incorporates the full year contributions of the businesses to be separate. We expect a fiscal year '24 effective tax rate of 22%.\nAs Claudia previously mentioned, we will carry temporarily elevated overhead costs needed to support CMS during the separation, including IT and corporate support. This, coupled with a historical seasonality, will have an approximately 10% negative effect year-over-year on adjusted EPS in Q1. We believe these costs are necessary to continue to support our clients as we progress through this transition period. This temporary cost is nonrecurring and shall not be viewed as a reflection of a stand-alone company earnings power.\nWe are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth in the years to come as we seek to compound per share value for our shareholders. We continue to be energized and excited about the future for Jacobs and CMS, and remain confident in our plan for long-term value creation. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions."

My name is [ Brent ], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Evans\n\nThank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nTurning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. And Claudia will provide an overview of separation-related activities.\nFinally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Before I hand it over to Bob, I want to address some reporting changes that were made in the quarter. We consistently review our reporting practices to be aligned with best practices for our industry and SEC guidelines.\nAfter review, we have decided to amend our name and convention for revenue, excluding pass-through costs from net revenue to adjusted net rent revenue. Note, this is simply a name change intended to make the non-GAAP nature of this measure more prominent and does not impact measurement.\nIn addition, after an internal review, we have made certain minor adjustments to pass-through revenues in certain prior periods to properly reflect amounts that had not been previously included. As a result, in the materials that we have included in the appendix to this presentation, we have adjusted People & Places adjusted net revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Note, this change has been deemed as immaterial has no impact on our reported earnings, operating income or cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'd like to begin by recognizing the continued commitment and extraordinary talent of our 60,000-plus teammates here at Jacobs. I've now been in the CEOC for over 6 months and as I spend time with our clients and our people, I continue to be both inspired and appreciative of the dedication and world-class expertise they bring to some of the world's toughest challenges.\nNow more than ever, our communities require the brightest and best minds to step forward with innovative and technology-enabled solutions to drive better outcomes. I'm proud of all that we do to play our part to enhance and serve those communities.\nFirstly, I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business before I move on to our third quarter results. The company continues to make significant progress on the activities associated with the intended separation. In addition, following the announcement, there has been positive interest from multiple outside parties. We are currently evaluating this interest consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value.\nAs previously communicated, a spin-off, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2024. Let me reiterate, we are laser-focused on maximizing value for all of our stakeholders. As we progress towards the separation of CMS, our teams continue to work tirelessly to stand up both companies for independent success.\nIn the process, we have identified a number of operational enhancements that we believe will propel each company to greater heights in the future. Consequently, we believe that fiscal year 2024 will be a year of optimization and acceleration.\nTurning to Slide 5. On optimization, we see significant potential to enhance our cost structure and our operating model to continue to drive efficiencies and lead our industry, not just in size but in profitability. This will unleash a more cohesive Jacobs that leverages our digital platforms, consulting and advisory and global delivery model to accelerate our value-creating growth.\nOn acceleration, for many years, we have highlighted investments in growth, in our people, platforms and technology-enabled solutions. We've invested behind and proudly managed a portfolio aligned with secular megatrend, critical infrastructure, water scarcity, sustainability, reshoring and energy transition. Our clients need us now more than ever, and we are delivering.\nJacobs is driving higher growth, higher margin, differentiated expertise and solutions. Our addressable market is growing, and we are already capitalizing on these opportunities.\nTurning to Slide 6 and Q3. I am pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our growth is entirely organic. And we continue to drive improving cash conversion, a hallmark of our business model, allowing us to invest behind our growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory.\nOur People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year and operating profit up 13% year-over-year. Kevin will detail the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units.\nWe continue to see broad-based green shoots with a gross margin backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth will persist at current rates. CMS remains a pillar of stability. CMS Q3 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year, and operating profit increased 12% behind 36 bps of margin expansion.\nCMS continued to book awards at an over 70% win rate. its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in fiscal 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete pursuits. As a result, the Jacobs team is advancing required flight software and hardware testing for the Artemis II missions scheduled for December 2024, the second scheduled flight of the program and notably its first crude mission.\nIn early July, an integrated team of NASA and Jacobs personnel at Marshall Space Center successfully completed the initial phase of formal qualification testing for the Artemis II SLS flight software, a very exciting time for all involved.\nPA Consulting sales and backlog once again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and defense sectors. Margins stabilized in Q3 above 21%, supported by strategic cost actions taken during the quarter, and we continue to have the highest confidence in our talented management team. PA continues to see increasing opportunities in energy transition. For example, we assisted a leading offshore wind developer in securing a fixed price electricity contract in Ireland's first offshore wind auction.\nPA is also seeing significant interest in its digital expertise from clients who are looking to assess AI-related impacts and opportunities for their businesses. As an example, a leading cybersecurity client hired PA to support the development of a comprehensive strategic plan with specific focus on understanding the power of AI and mitigating cyber threats.\nOur Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 72% year-over-year growth in operating profit. During the quarter, we won another competitive pursuit with the Ohio Department of Transportation to extend Streetlights Software-as-a-Service offering. Streetlight already provides statewide modeling and traffic analysis, safety programming and support for large scale planning efforts. This new contract is for congestion and freight management functionality to support the state's carbon emission reduction efforts.\nTurning to Slide 7. Looking across the Jacobs enterprise, we continue to see considerable and geographically diverse opportunities in our greater than $2 billion water business. From water reuse to treatment to drinking water coupled with our innovative project delivery offering, demand remains robust. During Q3, we saw a healthy growth behind water scarcity-related pursuits. For example, scope increases and new wins with our long-standing partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board.\nUnderinvestment in future proofing needs also -- proofing needs also continue to be a major driver. In the U.S., we have been selected by a large Southern California utility agency to provide program management and strategic funding advisory services to create a more sustainable, drought-resilient local water supply for one of the largest groundwater storage base.\nAnd in New Zealand, we were awarded an extension and expansion of our central interceptor program, the country's largest ever wastewater project. We also continue to see environmental and sustainability projects. For example, we landed a marquee $450 million award from the U.S. EPA's Great Lake National Program Office and RegionFind Super Fund to provide environmental, technical management services and associated infrastructure tasks in the Great Lakes area.\nWe also see continuing momentum in legislation and aligned work. IIJA aligned wins continue to accelerate versus the year ago period. And for example, we were awarded the Brent Spence Bridge, an iconic connector of economic development between Ohio and Kentucky which has been postponed for many years. And we continue to closely support the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority in their successful low and no emissions grant application. And subsequent subsequently performed delivery services to provide energy-efficient buses and charging infrastructure.\nTurning to Slide 8. In summary, we are extremely well poised for this strong growth across sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record for operational excellence.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob, and let me turn right to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our third quarter results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7.5%. Adjusted net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 25%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to PA Consulting.\nI will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 14.7%, over 100 basis points better sequentially and year-over-year more than offsetting the lower gross margin. Costs were well managed due to discipline and actions taken, and we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue to stay well below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023, improving upon the 16.2% figure realized in 2022.\nGAAP operating profit was $270 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, other transaction and separation-related costs and restructuring efforts of $38 million and a $1.4 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy.\nThe other transaction, separation related and restructuring costs of $38 million included 3 distinct types of costs. The first represents approximately 45% of the $38 million and relates to a restructuring initiative in our PA Consulting business to rightsize the cost structure to align with the company's end market demands.\nThe second cost represents approximately 35% of the amount and is associated with our initial advisory and other costs associated with the separation of the CMS.\nThird bucket, which is approximately 20% of the $34 million, is related to the cost of noncash PA contingent equity-based agreement associated with the PA transaction structure and other miscellaneous incentive costs that were considered part of the total consideration of previous transactions.\nExcluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $361 million, up over 10% year-over-year. Our total discrete items for the year, excluding the new CMS separation efforts, will remain at the $100 million figure that we have forecasted for the year, well below the total figure of $185 million in 2022. Of this $100 million figure, the total noncash impairment costs will total approximately $45 million. Such impairments will be largely complete as we exit this fiscal year. Of course, as we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS.\nI would let Claudia provide more detail in her prepared remarks. Our adjusted operating profit to adjusted net revenue was 10.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles; $0.20 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs; a $0.01 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint; and a $0.05 adjustment to align to our projected annual adjusted tax rate.\nExcluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.82, down 2% year-over-year. Importantly, while down versus the year ago period, 2022 benefited from the $0.08 cost investment gain associated with the sale of our WatchGuard investment.\nIn addition, in 2023, incremental interest costs of $0.07 have reduced EPS this quarter versus the year ago figure. The net impact is a $0.15 headwind in EPS year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, with Bob providing an overview of our guidance range at the end of our call, we expect Q4 EPS to show healthy growth versus the year ago period.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA was $355 million and was down 2% year-over-year, representing 10.5% of adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 3% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1x, with our gross margin and backlog, again, improving year-over-year.\nRegarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q3. People & Places Solutions continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 9% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units, led by advanced facilities.\nEurope continues to see some pressure, but was more than offset by strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was flat year-over-year, although gross margins in the backlog was up 8%, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of work\nQ3 operating profit was up 13% and and 15% in constant currency, driven by strong growth leverage and solid G&A management, resulting in operating profit as a percentage of adjusted net revenue of 14.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect year-over-year improvement and strong people in places operating profit margin and growth to continue in Q4.\nOur Advanced Facilities unit, which represents approximately 1/4 of our People & Places revenue and benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains, posted at sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite macroeconomic crosscurrents, our Tier 1 customers continue to pursue robust spending plans underpinned by long-term demand drivers.\nOur backlog and sales pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to be encouraged about the outlook for this segment.\nOur People & Places Americas unit reported Q3 operating profit with 10%-plus growth as legislation-driven backlog begins to convert at higher rates. For example, IIJA-related profit is trending nearly 20% ahead of our current plan. We remain enthusiastic about our overall growth opportunities with double-digit pipeline growth led by water, cities and places and energy and power.\nOur Q3 international business, revenue and operating profit were up high single digits year-over-year as Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be a bright spot in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits.\nMoving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q3 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. CMS has benefited from an over 70% win rate year-to-date. And as a result, backlog is up 12% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains very healthy as CMS positions for strategic growth in its core focus areas of space, defense, energy and technology solutions. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our previous guidance, with operating profit up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margins to approximately 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher margin opportunities.\nMoving to Divergent Solutions. Adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year as we remain focused on higher-margin contracts. This trend should be expected to continue near term before an acceleration in coming quarters as our investments in sales and technology offerings bear fruit. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 9.5%, a sequential improvement as compared to Q2's underlying normalized margin when adjusting for the benefit of a large license sale in the prior quarter.\nWe have increasing confidence that the underlying margin momentum over the past 2 quarters is durable. And as a result, we continue to expect divergence, quarterly margins to approach 10% in Q4.\nTurning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 3% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, an indication of the company's relative performance to peers driven by their value to clients in a tough economic environment. PA's Q3 operating profit margin was 21.2%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and up over 15% year-over-year. PA management continues to take action to improve utilization, and we expect OP margins to be 20%-plus for the medium term with potential for longer-term improvement.\nOur adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $62 million in Q3, consistent with our guidance. We expect that our quarterly run rate may remain elevated at or above the recent level for a short period of time. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model focused on infrastructure and advanced facility. Claudia will provide her perspective in her prepared remarks.\nTurning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings despite temporary restructuring and separation-related efforts. Free cash flow was $290 million, resulting in a year-to-date 127% conversion of net income into free cash flow. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at or above our anticipated 100% recorded and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year.\nRegarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in shares at an average price of $115. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in just over $2.1 billion of net debt.\nOur Q3 net debt to [ 2023 ] expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit profile both today and as a more focused business post our announced CMS separation.\nAs of the end of Q3, approximately 56% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense.\nFinally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which increased 13% year-over-year and will be paid on August 25. Before I formally transition the CFO role to Claudia on August 14, I wanted to say a few words on my last earnings call. It has been an honor working with such talented colleagues and witnessing our collective accomplishments over the past 8.5 years. During my tenure, I have observed growth and transformation within our company and I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made together.\nI extend my heartfelt thanks to the Board, leadership team and dedicated employees for their unwavering support, passion and commitment to excellence; to our investors, your trust has been instrumental in our success. While my time as CFO comes to an end, I remain confident in the company's bright future and have no doubt that the company is in good hands with Claudia in the CFO role. I also look forward to supporting Bob in my new role as a special adviser going forward.\nI will now turn the call over to Claudia.\n\nClaudia Jaramillo\n\nExecutive Vice President of Strategy & Corporate Development\n\nThank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12. I have now been with Jacobs for just over 1 year and look forward to formally succeeding Kevin next week. He has been a superb partner throughout this transition period and I feel privileged to help lead this company at such an important inflection point in its history.\nAs EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development, I've overseen the rollout of our strategic stand-up management office at the center of the CMS separation. Our goal is to continue to serve our clients without interruption, optimize both companies operating models and to effectively manage risk associated with the separation.\nDue to the hard and tireless work of our teams, we have made significant progress towards effective We can also confidently reinforce that we intend to eliminate separation-related stranded costs. In addition, we have identified value levers that we believe can lead to continued productivity gains at independent Jacobs.\nLast quarter, we outlined independent Jacobs target operating profit margins of 12% from separation alone. Yet, we believe there is further upside, and it is our goal to further expand margins post separation. We'll have more to say about that over time. But one of the most exciting aspects of the separation is the opportunity to drive further growth and profitability with the streamlined Jacobs.\nJacobs has a recognized sustainable business model with a strong foundation that aligns purpose with both growth and value creation. I, like the rest of the Jacobs team, am absolutely committed to Jacobs' purpose-led vision. Our vision underpins our commitment to deliver superior results for our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders. I look forward to meeting more of our employees, clients and investors in the weeks and months to come, as I assume the CFO position.\nThank you, and I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 13. Due to strong year-to-date performance and forward indicators, we reiterate our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. We will provide guidance for fiscal year 2024 in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release.\nTurning to Slide 14. In closing, I would like to express my tremendous appreciation for Kevin's contribution to the transformational success of our company over the last 8-plus years. Kevin is a great personal friend and has been a fantastic business partner. I am privileged to have his continued support as my special adviser. We are very fortunate to have Claudia as a critical leader on our team. I look forward to her continued accomplishments and contributions building on her success to date.\nOperator, we will now open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I will turn things over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Evans.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call.\nIn addition, this morning, we published a release announcing our intent to create 2 independent companies with the separation of our Critical Mission Solutions business. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nTurning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of today's portfolio announcement, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks. And then we'll open up the call for questions.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and thank all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance.\nJacobs has a story of 75-year history of delivering value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We have consistently strived to improve our company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio to capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent markets.\nTurning to Slide 4. Today's announcement marks a key inflection point as we progress on our journey of continuous improvement and value creation. This morning, Jacobs announced our intent to separate our Critical Mission Solutions business through a spin-off.\nThe decision to separate CMS is a result of a comprehensive review and evaluation to identify opportunities that streamline our portfolio and maximize strategic focus and potential growth opportunities for both future companies. We will sharpen both companies focus on their distinct strategies and operational initiatives that are most relevant to the specific industries in which they operate.\nEach company will have a tailored capital allocation and structure that is directed towards their respective growth strategies as well as a strength and ability to attract and retain top talent.\nMoving forward, in addition to our industry-leading position in core sectors, Jacobs will be a higher growth, higher margin, technology-enabled solutions provider continuing to address the world's most complex critical infrastructure and sustainability challenges. Jacobs core skill sets in technical and consulting services, coupled with data science and technology-enabled expertise will continue to differentiate us from our peers and allow us to provide end-to-end solutions to our global clients.\nOur streamlined portfolio will include leading positions in critical infrastructure such as water and environment, energy transition, transportation and the advanced manufacturing sectors. Once the separation is complete, we can focus our attention on building additional capabilities and expertise that matter most to our clients in these areas. And importantly, we'll achieve even greater alignment with our 3 key accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory.\nThe new CMS will be a leading pure play government services company that provides technical consulting, applied science research, training, intelligent asset management and program management services to federal government agencies.\nCMS generated approximately $4.4 billion in FY '22 revenue. Today's announcement is another step in Jacobs' long record of taking bold actions to drive value creation and position our company for an even stronger future. And as we grow and thrive, our partners can achieve more as well.\nI want to emphasize that this announcement does not change how we work with our clients. As we work towards the separation, it will be business as usual. We remain committed to delivering world-class service to our clients, who will be able to rely on our people they know and trust.\nTurning to Slide 5. The proposed capital structure, governance and other matters relating to the separation will be communicated at a later date. Subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, we are targeting to complete the separation in the second half of fiscal year 2024 through a distribution that is intended to be tax free to Jacobs shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nTurning to Slide 6. I want to reinforce the importance of our inclusive and forward-thinking culture. Last quarter, we reinforced our commitment to inclusion and diversity by including a gender quality KPI in our sustainability linked bond. Jacobs remains categorically committed to this goal.\nTurning to Q2 on Slide #7. I want to thank our more than 60,000 global teammates for delivering a record second quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our underlying business remains strong, and we continue to drive growth organically.\nWe continue to invest behind and grow share in all key areas of focus against our 3 needle-moving growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory.\nOur People & Places line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 7% year-on-year, 10% in constant currency and operating profit up 21% year-over-year, 25% in constant currency. Our pipeline and gross margin in backlog increased further supported by strong legislative drivers materializing in federal, state and local initiatives.\nCMS remains a stable base of recurring revenue driven primarily this quarter by the NASA Kennedy rebid award. CMS Q2 revenue was 11% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher year-over-year.\nIn terms of bookings this quarter, CMS also achieved an impressive overall win rate and the outlook for FY '23 continues to look strong with its pipeline up double digits year-over-year. We continue to invest behind CMS opening our Japan office during Q2, our first organic office opening since 2004.\nPA Consulting sales and backlog again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and utilities and defense sectors demonstrating momentum and consistency. I'm pleased to see margins improved in the quarter to over 20%, supported by milestone incentive achievement. PA continues to benefit from increased opportunities in Europe.\nFor example, PA won a mandate for a private Scandinavian renewable energy company that is currently active in renewable electricity generation and storage. PA is working with the client to create a market entry strategy across offshore and onshore wind in several new European markets.\nOur divergent solutions operating unit had a strong operating profit quarter with operating profit up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we extended our collaboration with Palantir across multiple infrastructure applications. Kevin will give more detail in his comments.\nLooking across the broader market environment, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for growth in climate response and energy and environment. For example, our approximately $2 billion water business continues to exceed expectations and reinforce our position in the water sector.\nWater continues to be a pacesetter with pipeline growth up materially year-over-year. During Q2, we were awarded the Donald advanced water purification facility by the LA Bureau Sanitation, 1 of the largest reuse projects in the U.S. delivering a more sustainable drinking water source in a drought stressed region.\nFittingly, we would like to call attention to drinking water week, an opportunity to proudly celebrate the work we do with utility partners to provide safe drinking water to millions of people around the world.\nOur cities and places pipeline also grew double digits, including key wins in the Middle East, where we are working to reimagine urban development addressing major environmental and quality of life challenges and predominantly powered by clean energy.\nGlobally, we are seeing significant energy transition opportunities. Last month, we efficiently launched a dedicated business unit in PMPS to focus on significant opportunities in global energy transition to accelerate growth and address the ever-expanding needs of our clients.\nTurning to Slide 8. During Q2, we were awarded the Gold Medal Award for International Corporate Achievement and Sustainable Development by the World Environment Center, a nongovernmental organization advancing sustainable development through corporate business practices.\nTheir annual Gold Medal Award recognizes 1 international company demonstrating a global vision and a commitment to sustainable development through innovative applications of policies, economic, environmental and social responsibilities.\nThe independent jury commended our thoughtful approach to sustainability, combining commitments with global initiatives and partnerships with positive and far-reaching impact.\nTurning to Slide 9. In summary, we remain well positioned with our industry-leading ranking across multiple sectors. This is particularly evident in our advanced manufacturing business, where our long-term pipeline increased double digits year-over-year.\nFurther, in our infrastructure business, legislative actions continue to provide visible growth opportunities despite continued political debate on broader topics. For example, recent wins this quarter include 3 significant intelligent O&M programs in California, Florida and Louisiana, which we secured through strong differentiation with the use of our digitally enabled platform.\nWe expect operating profit growth to outpace organic top line increases as we remain focused on quality of backlog.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob, and good day to everyone. Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter results.\nSecond quarter gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 5%. Net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a continuation of healthy growth against a tough 10% year ago comparison.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% sequentially in line with the first quarter, but down year-over-year. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks.\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, approximately flat sequentially, but down 90 basis points year-over-year, more than offsetting the lower gross margin percentage versus last year.\nWhile we felt the impacts from inflationary pressure, costs were managed well overall to disciplined cost management. We are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023.\nGAAP operating profit was $290 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $10 million noncash charge related to decrease in our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $8 million.\nThese deal-related costs are largely incentive compensation that was considered part of total consideration and PA noncash contingent equity-based agreements associated with the PA transaction structure. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $356 million, up 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 11% year-over-year.\nWe remain committed to reducing our restructuring-related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect approximately $15 million of restructuring charges for fiscal year 2023. We also expect a total $50 million to $55 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of the year as we continue to further execute our work -- future of work strategy.\nFinally, we expect $25 million of transaction-related expenses for the full year from deal-related integration and other costs, most of which is performance-based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions.\nIt also includes the noncash contingent-based equity noted earlier associated with our PA transaction structure. These costs do not include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS, given the early stage of our process.\nOur adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment.\nGAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.70 per share and included a $0.20 -- $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, a $0.06 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, $0.03 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs and a $0.25 adjustment to align to our projected annual normalized adjusted tax rate as a result of a large FIN 48 reserve release.\nExcluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.81, up 5% year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, Bob will provide an overview of our narrowed guidance range later in his prepared remarks. We also note that our Q3 EPS is expected to be relatively flat sequentially to Q2.\nI would like to highlight that the fiscal year 2022 third quarter adjusted results benefited from a onetime $0.10 gain on an equity investment. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $358 million and was up 5% year-over-year, representing 10.4% of net revenue.\nFinally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year and 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x with our gross margin in backlog, again, improving year-over-year.\nRegarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q2. Our results in the quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and end market resiliency, enabling us to deliver strong, consistent OP growth.\nPeople & Places Solutions continues to drive our momentum. Overall, PMPS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends and legislative drivers previously highlighted.\nQ2 net revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units although Europe continues to see some pressure. Backlog grew 4% year-over-year behind a book-to-bill of 1.1x.\nGross margin in backlog was up nearly double digits in constant currency. Q2 operating profit was up 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong growth and G&A control. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.5%, up over 150 basis points year-over-year, again, driven by solid revenue growth and continued cost discipline.\nWe continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit margin resulting in strong double-digit growth in full year operating profit.\nOur Advanced Facilities unit, which benefits from the investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients, which comprise approximately 2/3 of this business.\nIn semiconductors, the evolving macro backdrop has led some smaller clients to evaluate project timing, but we remain confident in the long duration opportunity ahead for Jacobs.\nOur backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our Advanced Facilities growth rate to persist against a very strong year ago comparisons.\nOur People & Places Americas unit reported record Q2 profit with 30% year-over-year growth as our high-quality backlog begins to convert to revenue at improving incremental margins. We remain enthusiastic about our growth opportunity as backlog and sales pipelines remain robust as we compare to stronger year-ago comparisons.\nIn particular, our water sales pipeline of opportunities continues to shine, up double digits. Our international business, Q2 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year. Asia Pacific and the Middle East continues to grow, driven by strong pipelines in transportation, cities and places and energy transition. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support.\nThe business is aligned to space exploration, national security, nuclear remediation priorities and U.S. 5G telecom investments. Q2 revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency.\nCMS book-to-bill was just over 1.4x benefiting from the Kennedy award that we previously disclosed. As a result, backlog is up 8% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains strong with $30 billion in new opportunities that we are pursuing. In addition, we are awaiting award on $10 billion in new business opportunities that are in the end gain select process.\nCMS gross profit margins improved sequentially due to mix. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially from Q1 and consistent with our previous guidance, but down slightly versus the very strong year ago quarter. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023, with full year CMS margins expected to approach 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher-margin opportunities.\nMoving to Divergent Solutions. Net revenue declined 3% year-over-year as we focus on quality growth opportunities that will translate into higher margins. We continue to expect net revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings.\nOperating profit for the -- operating profit margin for the quarter was above our corporate average at 11.1%. During the quarter, we recognized a large license sale which expanded the margin by more than 300 basis points. Sales of these types of solutions are now a longer-term financial benefit of our Divergent Solutions strategy and a core offering of the reporting unit.\nAlthough deals of this size should not be expected to recur every quarter. Even excluding the benefits of the license sale, the underlying margin momentum seen in Q2 continued to improve sequentially for our previous guidance. As a result, we expect Divergent quarterly margins to approach 10% as we near the end of the fiscal year the scale begins to further mitigate the impact of the continued investments for growth.\nTurning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 1% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but up over 11% in local currency. PA once again reported a book-to-bill over 1x. We continue to expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nTurning to profitability. Q2 operating profit margin for PA was 21.8%, up 370 basis points sequentially due to fixed price milestone achievements and lower incentive costs. As PA continues to take actions to improve utilization, we expect OP margins to be around 20% in the back half, relatively close to their year-to-date OP margin performance.\nOur unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q2, an increase over our previous run rate estimate, driven by inflationary pressure in health care and digital investments. For the full year, we now expect our quarterly run rate for the balance of the year and unallocated corporate costs to be in line with our Q2 level, driven by inflationary pressure in health care costs and incentive costs.\nTurning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of earnings power and cash conversion capabilities.\nFree cash flow was $97 million, resulting in approximately 100% conversion of net income into free cash flow for the first half of fiscal year 2023. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year.\nRegarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion resulting in just over $2.2 billion of net debt. Our Q2 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet.\nWe remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. As of the end of Q2, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was 4.8%. In February, Jacobs completed the refinancing of existing debt and Jacob's inaugural issuance of a $500 million sustainability-linked bond.\nThe bond was priced at a competitive fixed rate and includes a KPI aligned with Jacobs commitment to increase gender diversity and leadership positions and to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. For your benefit, in the appendix of this presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on June 23.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives and narrow our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45.\nFinally, with today's announcement, we are reinforcing our continuous commitment to take proactive actions to create greater shareholder value as well as strategic and value-creating benefits for both future companies and their respective stakeholders. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJonathan Doros\n\nVP of IR, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I'd like to refer you to Slide 2 of this presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nTurning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined today by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by summarizing highlights from our first quarter results, discuss our commitment to sustainability and then provide an update on our strategy. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.\nIn the appendix of the presentation, we provide additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it on to Bob Pragada, CEO.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident, COO, CEO & Director, Jacobs Solutions Inc.\n\nThank you, Jon. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Starting on Slide 4. I'd like to welcome to the call, Claudia Jaramillo who is currently our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. We recently announced her transition to CFO later this year.\nI'm excited to now lead Jacobs' CEO. Over the last several years, we have repositioned the company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio and capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent sectors. At this juncture in our strategy, strong execution and focus is pivotal to our success.\nThere are 3 key priorities: first, we will maintain our inclusive and inspirational culture that fosters the creativity needed to live by our mission, challenge today, reinventing tomorrow; second, we will focus on driving a higher structural growth rate across our core sectors by executing against the 3 needle-moving growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory across the entire organization and sectors we serve.\nWhile we are in a leading position to capitalize on the mega trends and structural tailwinds, our relentless focus on long-term client relationships is driving sustained growth. Third, we will deliver long-term returns for our shareholders by driving further operational discipline across the business to accelerate cash flow generation with disciplined capital allocation.\nFrom a financial standpoint, our underlying business remains strong. Our People & Places Solutions line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 8% year-over-year, 13% in constant currency, operating profit up 20% year-over-year, 28% in constant currency, and we continue to gain market share in both the global critical infrastructure and advanced facility sectors.\nIn CMS, we continue to deliver a strong base of recurring revenue with a growing new business pipeline. We anticipate strong tailwinds and backlog growth with CMS moving forward. PA Consulting experienced lower-than-expected utilization, but we continue to experience double-digit top line and backlog growth. We are seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in PA sales pipeline.\nA number of recent wins underscores our strategy and demonstrates our move up the value chain with our clients to higher-margin consulting and advisory services. Across the company, we see exciting opportunities ahead of us, specifically in the areas of climate response and especially in energy transition. Our ability to deliver data-enabled solutions is enhancing our clients' resilience and sustainability.\nThe establishment of divergent solutions enables Jacobs to scale and deploy our domain-centric data platforms across multiple sectors and geographies, further enabling us to deliver solutions to technically complex challenges. I will talk to these key themes further in the presentation.\nTurning to Slide 5. We remain steadfastly committed to our cultural transformation to create an inspirational journey for all. In 2015, we started our culture journey with the empowerment and accountability, incorporating inclusion, innovation and inspiration into the very fabric of the company.\nI believe our emphasis on inclusion and diversity has been a critically important contributor to our success and provides a key differentiator in attracting and retaining the world's best talent, as well as driving innovation for our clients. A key benefit of being a company with a broad range of capabilities is our ability to provide multiple career and development opportunities, what we refer to as agile careers.\nWhen we learn and grow together, we activate empowerment and accountability, inclusion and diversity and innovation. We lead, embrace and anticipate change. To further demonstrate our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we have included a KPI in the refinancing of our credit facilities linked to female leadership representation. Kevin will discuss further details in his remarks.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our commitment to sustainability is core to our strategy and our significant performance is being recognized by many of the top ESG accredited institutions. Over the past 5 years, we have advanced to an industry-leading status. This culminated in our inclusion in the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, ranking Jacobs among the world's leading companies with outstanding sustainability performance. While the scores themselves are impressive, what's even more significant is the public recognition of Jacobs' positive impact on our clients, communities and the world.\nAs we turn to Slide 7, we will focus on our key -- our 4 key growth sectors of critical infrastructure, energy and environment, advanced facilities and national security. These growth sectors are driven by the following catalysts: federal government stimulus from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, supply chain and technology investments in advanced facilities and the emergence of increased global threats.\nLet's examine the legislative drivers first and our positioning in the market. I am proud that Jacobs has helped our clients secure over $1 billion in IIJA competitive grants since its passing, and the bill is only in its early stages. We supported our clients in securing over $350 million in IIJA competitive grant funding just last quarter, the largest quarter since the passing of the act. This includes the largest grant awarded nationwide for subway station accessibility in New York City, a major port infrastructure development grant to a long-term client in Alaska, the first phase award of one of the largest water treatment plants in the U.S. and the design of a sustainable battery recycling facility.\nWith another 4 years of locked in and robust funding, the U.S. infrastructure climate is strong. The coming months will also bring the first dollars of 2 other areas of focus for Jacobs. The inflation Reduction Act with $369 billion to fund the Green Economy transition and the CHIPS Act for semiconductor investment, all in core Jacob sectors.\nBefore the end of the calendar year, we fully expect to have all 3 bills firing at full strength and funding critical projects sponsored by local governments, the federal government and the semiconductor industry. This overlap of spending will continue for 4 or 5 consecutive fiscal quarters and drive growth across the infrastructure and energy markets.\nIn advanced facilities, we continue to see sustained capital investment in the semiconductor manufacturing space, biotechnology capacity expansions and the electric vehicle ecosystem, all being driven by reshaping of global supply chains, technology advancements and decarbonization efforts.\nTurning to Slide 8. As evidenced by double-digit pipeline growth in each of these sectors, our industry position continues to grow, and we see this being a long-term secular trend. In addition to previously discussed infrastructure wins, we have been awarded major programs in the semiconductor space to include greenfield expansions in the U.S. and Europe for a global chip manufacturer.\nIn the biotechnology sector, we have won multiple expansions in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and we continue to see global growth in electric vehicle ecosystem driven by a favorable regulatory environment with project wins for battery and vehicle manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the U.S. and Europe. Within National Security, we are seeing increased defense spending in the U.S., U.K. and Australia due to continued global threat.\nAs highlighted as a future prospect last quarter, in the U.S., we were successful in winning a critical cyber & intelligence award for $469 million, 5-year contract for a classified defense customer to provide secure data and network solutions globally. In the U.K., PA is leading the consortium that has been selected by the MOD to deliver Crenic, a future force protection electronic countermeasures program. It will provide the next generation of innovative solutions to counter the threat posed by radio-controlled and provides explosive devices, otherwise known as IEDs.\nAnd in Australia, we are supporting the acquisition and sustainment of military platforms for the Australian Defense Department, which has engaged Jacobs with increasing volumes of work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. Let's turn to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our first quarter results. First quarter gross revenue grew 12% year-over-year, and net revenue grew 8%. Net revenue grew 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an acceleration from our fiscal year 2022 constant currency growth of 8%.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26%, sequentially in line with the fourth quarter, but as expected, was down approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, the remaining year-over-year impact of the Idaho remediation contract; and two, lower utilization in PA consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks.\nBoth People & Places Solutions and Divergent Solutions gross margins were flat year-over-year. We expect total gross margins to remain plus or minus 26% of net revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year and trending higher as we exit the year from a higher margin mix of revenue and new higher-margin opportunities from our growth accelerators. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.5%, slightly higher than Q4, but down 130 basis points year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we benefited from lower employee benefit costs, which were mostly offset by miscellaneous other cost. During the remainder of the fiscal year, we plan to make additional investments in employee welfare programs such as higher 401(k) match and improved medical benefits as part of our continued investment in improving our culture and employee engagement. These costs are factored into our full year outlook. As a result, we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023.\nGAAP operating profit was $238 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $28 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future of work strategy. And finally, other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $17 million. Actual restructuring costs were less than half of these costs and supported the creation of our new Divergent Solutions reporting segment. The remaining costs are largely related to PA noncash contingent equity-based agreements associated with our PA transaction structure.\nAdjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring-related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect $15 million of restructuring charges for the full year fiscal year 2023.\nWe also expect another $30 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of Q2 and Q3 as we further execute our future work strategy. Finally, we expect approximately $20 million of transaction-related expenses from deal-related integration and other costs, most of which is performance-based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions.\nIt also includes the noncash contingent based equity associated with our PA transaction structure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, flat year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.07 per share and included a $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, a $0.16 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, a $0.09 adjustment to align to our projected annual tax rate and a $0.09 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs.\nExcluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.67, up 7% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $339 million and was up 9% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x with our gross margin and backlog as a percentage of net revenue, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.\nOur book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching NASA -- Kennedy NASA bid, as the project's backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q1. Before delving into the details by segment, I would like to make some overall comments regarding the strength and diversity of the Jacobs portfolio. As you all know, all aspects of our portfolio are aligned with long-term secular growth trends.\nOur results in the quarter exhibit the strength of this diversity and its ability to deliver strong consistent operating profit growth. In this quarter, our People & Places Solutions business led the way, so let's start with them. Overall, people and places delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends that Bob discussed earlier.\nQ1 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency. All business units contributed solid and often very strong constant currency growth. Backlog grew 2% year-over-year and gross margin and backlog was up double digits in constant currency with a book-to-bill greater than 1.\nTotal People & Places Solutions Q1 gross margins were flat year-over-year, with Q1 operating profit up 20% and 28% in constant currency. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 14.5%, up over 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and a disciplined management of overhead costs. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit and margin, resulting in strong double-digit growth in full year operating profit.\nOur Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted the strongest double-digit revenue and operating profit growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients, and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients, which comprise 2/3 of our People & Places business.\nOur backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our advanced facilities growth rate to remain strong during fiscal year 2023 despite the very solid and strong 2022 year-over-year comparisons. Our Americas unit had an outstanding quarter with over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth, driven by infrastructure-related monetization wins, beginning to convert to revenue. The backlog and sales pipeline provides us confidence as we are seeing many large programs mature for a late 2023 or early 2024 award, which should continue to support longer-term momentum.\nOur international business, Q1 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year on a reported basis, but grew double digits in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during Q2 with FX neutralizing over the second half of our fiscal year, assuming no large variation from existing current foreign exchange rates.\nMoving to Critical Mission Solutions. CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to national security, space exploration and energy transition priorities mainly in the U.S., Europe and Australia, as well as infrastructure monetization solutions such as U.S. 5G telecom investments.\nQ1 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency, driven by the Idaho nuclear remediation project contract that ramped up in Q2 of last year. For the remainder of fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the CMS business as we now compare to quarters that include the Idaho project.\nCMS book-to-bill was just over 1x and continues to be impacted by the approaching NASA Kennedy rebid, which we expect to be awarded soon. Gross profit margins were down year-over-year due to the revenue mix impact from the lower margin remediation project and the year ago closeout benefits associated with our strong performance on several enterprise contracts.\nCMS operating profit was $82 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was aligned with expectations and was down 170 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, but up 60 basis points sequentially from the Q4 figure. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023 with the ability to expand margins as we can convert higher-margin opportunities in our sales pipeline.\nMoving to Divergent Solutions. Gross revenue was up 11% year-over-year and when excluding the impact from pass-throughs, net revenue increased 7% year-over-year. We expect net revenue growth to accelerate materially in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings.\nGross margins in Divergent are in line with our consolidated gross margin, which we believe provides us the ability to significantly expand DVS operating margins as we gain additional scale from our heightened growth investments. Operating profit margins were 6%, driven by early stage investments and well below our future run rate projections for this business as we begin to embed integrated data-enabled offerings in our core markets. We expect Divergent to finish fiscal 2023 with margins approaching double digits.\nTurning to PA Consulting. The translation impact from a stronger U.S. dollar from the year ago period continued to impact reported revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue from PA was down 3% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, but up over 11% in British pounds. PA had a solid book-to-bill of over 1x. We expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during fiscal year 2023.\nTurning to profitability. During fiscal year 2022, PA aggressively hired ahead of an increasing demand from secular -- from strong secular growth opportunities across energy transition, sustainable consumer goods and strategic and digital transformation opportunities. While the sales pipeline remains robust and backlog continues to grow, the delayed conversion of these opportunities into burn continues to impact utilization. As a result, Q1 operating profit margins were 18%. While actions have been taken to significantly improve utilization, we expect margins to improve incrementally approaching 20% as we exit the fiscal year.\nOur nonallocated corporate costs were $40 million, down year-over-year as we made a strategic decision to move to a more flexible paid time off program in the U.S. and invest further enhanced employee welfare plans, including improved medical, 401(k) match benefits and parental leave offerings. We believe this strategic decision is key to further strengthening our culture and attracting world -- and attracting and retaining world-class talent.\nWhile Q1 was lower than our previous quarter run rate guidance, we do expect that our corporate costs for the year will increase to our previous estimate of $190 million to $210 million. And we are monitoring our medical and other fringe costs closely, which can vary depending upon our revenue and delivery mix as well as seasonality of medical claims.\nTurning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $270 million, and included an outflow of $60 million for payment of the CARES Act deferral benefit of payroll taxes and $6 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding the unusual payment associated with the CARES Act, our underlying free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $330 million.\nIn the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to approximate the year-ago figure driven by the very strong Q1 performance. For the full year, we continue to anticipate 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we repurchased approximately $140 million a share during the quarter, as we previously have discussed -- or excuse me, as we previously announced, the Board of Directors have also approved a new 3-year $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares if we see price dislocation in our relative valuation.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulting in $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q1 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. And given our commitment to inclusion and diversity, all of Jacobs bank debt now has a sustainability-linked KPR target of achieving a 40% female representation in our management team as defined as our Vice President and above population. As of the end of Q1, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt which includes our $500 million notional interest rate lock of 2.7%. As of the end of the first quarter, our weighted average interest cost was 4.6%. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense.\nFinally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on March 24. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident, COO, CEO & Director, Jacobs Solutions Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12. Our portfolio is positioned to benefit from multiple secular growth trends across our core sectors with the opportunity to structurally increase our long-term earnings power by executing against our growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory.\nWe reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.20 to $7.50, which incorporates recent FX rates. In closing, I would like to reiterate my priorities as CEO to maintain an inspirational and inclusive culture that will capitalize on our growth accelerators and drive long-term returns for our shareholders.\nBefore we open up the call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere condolences on behalf of Jacobs to all those affected by the terrible earthquakes that occurred in Turkey and Syria earlier this week. Our employees have yet again demonstrated a culture of caring and practice by raising their hands to seek ways to support those most impacted by this tragedy. I'm proud to lead a company that rises to the calling in such challenging circumstances. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Doros\n\nVP of IR, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning to all. Earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Now turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman.\nSteve will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then provide an overview of our software and technology platforms. Bob will then review our performance by line of business, and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flows.\nFinally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we provide additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 business performance and 2023 outlook. As I transition to Jacobs' Executive Chair, I'm excited and confident about the next phase of our strategy: Boldly Moving Forward. This strategy continues to unlock and elevate our transformed high-performance culture to capture significant growth opportunities we've identified across climate response, consulting advisory and data solutions, while benefiting from the recurring nature and diversity of our core businesses. From a financial standpoint, we believe the rigorous execution of this strategy will result in enhanced long-term revenue growth and expansion in our profit margin profile.\nDuring our last 2 strategies, we maintained a focus on continuing to reshape our business through organic investments, acquisitions and divestitures. And by doing so, we were able to deliver value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Since we started our journey together in 2016, we intentionally transformed our culture and our brand, grew revenue and expanded profit margins, leading to a total shareholder return of approximately 250%, almost twice the return of the S&P 500. We believe the next phase will be equally as transformative as we maintain our brand promise of challenging today and reinventing tomorrow.\nLet's now discuss our fourth quarter results. We're seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in our sales pipelines in a number of [market] recent wins, which underscores our strategy. During the quarter, net revenue grew 6% year-over-year and grew 11% on a constant currency basis with another quarter of constant currency growth across each line of business.\nBacklog was up 5% from the prior year's quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis. Within People & Places Solutions, our advanced facilities business again posted double-digit year-over-year top line and operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. And the remaining P&PS units in constant currency also experienced year-over-year growth.\nDuring the current quarter, Critical Mission Solutions is beginning to see previously delayed opportunities into the final stages with a major cyber win last week and with another win close to clearing the protest period.\nPA Consultancy and -- PA Consulting in constant currency continued to show strong Q4 growth with revenue up 9% and backlog up 8% year-over-year. PA successfully won a large multiyear contract with the Ministry of Defense to secure the next-generation soldier in what's proving to be a digitally-enabled battlefield. From a full year standpoint, we finished the year within our original guidance range, even when recognizing the translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar with double-digit net revenue and operating profit growth on a constant currency basis.\nTurning to Slide 5. Let me discuss an element of our Data Solutions accelerator that's housed within the Divergent Solutions business unit, which we will formally break out starting in our fiscal first quarter of 2023. We have consolidated the majority of our software and data solutions into a single unit to gain benefits from consistent product management, marketing and research and development. Our data solutions are aligned to 3 high-growth verticals of transportation, water and national security.\nA competitive differentiation of our vertical software platforms is access and integration of unique data sets and the ability to turn that data into actionable outcomes for our customers. For example, our StreetLight Data platform is a SaaS solution that ingests a variety of mobility data sources into proprietary algorithms that provide data analytics for both traditional transportation clients and Giga-Projects within the broader infrastructure market.\nOur GeoPod technology creates mapping data for multiple confidential customers as they plan for autonomous driving, precision agriculture and other aerial surveillance requirements. In water, we continue to leverage smart algorithms developed by our domain experts to optimize our clients' operations and maintenance, both AquaDNA and our Intelligent O&M solution can save 10% to 30% in energy use for wastewater treatment. We continue to expand our water solutions across our clients' assets life cycle.\nFrom a national security standpoint, our Extreme Search solution has proprietary algorithms and compute ability that can rapidly search large volumes of real-time or live data. One critical use case is quickly finding indicators of compromise to prevent cyber breaches. Given the significant amount of data that will be created and utilized in IT and OT environments, we believe the applications of these type of solutions are in the early stages of decades of robust growth.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bob, first, I'd like to thank the amazing people at Jacobs for living our values and progressing our culture over the last several years. Every single day, Jacobs is providing critical solutions globally. For example, most recently, supporting NASA for the Artemis launch to the moon or consulting on green hydrogen solutions for sovereign nations, delivering world-scale biotechnology manufacturing solutions, remediating harmful PFAS chemicals from our water or planning autonomous transportation for the city of the future. It is truly our people that make Jacobs a company like no other.\nNow I'd like to congratulate Bob on his appointment to CEO and say that I'm excited we have an experienced a dynamic leader who brings decades of industry domain knowledge and a proven track record to lead our Boldly Moving Forward strategy into the future. Bob?\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. I'm honored to take on the role of CEO early next year and advance the exciting work underway to further diversify our capabilities and offerings, increasing opportunities and value for our people, our clients and our shareholders alike. I want to thank Steve for his partnership and guidance over the past 7 years. He is an incredible leader who inspires all around (inaudible) a tremendous legacy at Jacobs.\nI'll begin on Slide 6, discussing our People & Places Solutions business where we achieved strong top and bottom line results with backlog up 8% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency.\nWith critical infrastructure priorities on the rise over the past year, our quarter results show that we've been successful in converting opportunities into accessible backlog. This success is underpinned by our global workforce, which expanded 12% this year. For example, in FY '22, our advanced facilities operating -- advanced facilities unit operating profit grew by well over 25% and on a constant currency basis due to our scalable multi-geography delivery teams.\nOverall, we see our quarter results as Jacobs strategy in action. It's proof that Jacobs deep domain expertise can transform client outcomes, replacing conventional infrastructure delivery with modern data-enabled solutions. I'll discuss results under the themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization and client response. Across these themes, I'll highlight how our technology and data solutions enable our success.\nFirst, supply chain diversification has led to expanded delivery for clients with long-term investment profiles that continue through changing economic conditions. In life sciences, our clients are in the middle of a generational expansion of therapeutics and vaccines as well as advanced health care and [tapping] people on a global scale. Our confidential clients can accelerate production capacity for life-saving medicines for the most widespread chronic diseases by leveraging Jacobs' expertise in digital design to optimize delivery across multiple large-scale biotech campuses.\nWe are also advising and delivering predictive analytics for point-of-care treatment resulting in improved outcomes for a growing and aging population with clients such as New South Wales Health Infrastructure in Australia, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S.\nJacobs remains uniquely positioned across the entire electric vehicle ecosystem to address all aspects of this rapidly expanding market from manufacturing capacity to EV charging infrastructure to advanced mobility implementation.\nWith favorable tailwinds and expanding list of automobile and EV manufacturing clients are seeking Jacobs' leading support to develop sustainable production capacity.\nMoving to climate response. Global demand for affordable green energy led to an increase of over 33% in bookings with wins across multiple geographies, including the U.K.'s National Grid, U.S. Department of Energy, Elenergy in Korea where we're developing a new green hydrogen production and import facility.\nIn the U.S., IIJA supported pipeline is building momentum and projects are moving through the sales cycle into delivery. For example, there is a broad focus on transportation decarbonization with support for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, NEVI, across multiple DOTs. Charging infrastructure for the navy and in multiple states under the low or no emission vehicle brand programs. For the environment agency in the U.K., we are living a digital proof-of-concept, leveraging spatial, predictive analytics to avoid extensive damage in human casualties due to flooding and other climate-driven disasters.\nAt the same time, national highways chose us to streamline their complex data landscape, thanks to our cyber and digital capabilities, partnered with PA Consulting. With StreetLight Data's multimodal transportation insights platform, we've expanded opportunities for both traditional public sector transportation clients and new private sector clients to prioritize marketing and real estate investments.\nWater sector clients are investing in our new technologies, such as AquaDNA, Dragonfly and intelligent operations maintenance. These integrated AI and ML cloud-based technologies enable clients to provide reliable clean water access for all communities, leading to expanded services this quarter from wins in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, the U.K., Singapore and Australia. These innovative platforms are driving the new standard for asset management.\nIn Hawaii, we are delivering a 20-year installation development plan to address climate adaptation for the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Under infrastructure modernization, mega program delivery trends continue as clients look for more efficient ways to deliver sustainable, livable places. In Scandinavia, we are designing the Nordhavn Tunnel to cross the harbor in Copenhagen, Denmark. And in Toronto, MetroLinx recently awarded Jacobs a multiyear extension to support their $85 billion regional transit expansion.\nIn summary, People & Places Solutions is positioned for long-term growth as evidenced by strong performance across all geographies and client segments. Clients are continuing to partner with Jacobs to deliver transformative infrastructure, advanced manufacturing expansion and energy security projects with sustainable lasting outcomes.\nMoving to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions line of business. CMS delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with backlog remaining strong at $10.6 billion, flat year-over-year, with gross profit in backlog was up 10% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency.\nOur CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. CMS's service and solutions offerings are delivered across our core customer markets: base, cyber, intelligence, defense and energy. And we continue to see strong demand for our solutions across all of them.\nIn space, Jacobs is a critical prime contractor to NASA's Artemis program, including being the key integrator of the successful uncrewed launch last week of the space launch system rocket in preparation to spend U.S. astronauts back to the moon by 2025. The Artemis I launch is historic, and we are proud of Jacobs' role in the mission. Also, we were awarded contracts by the Scottish rocket manufacturer and small sat launch service provider Orbex to help them build and operate a vertical launch site for satellites in the U.K.\nSeveral trends in other Jacobs key markets that we are seeing contributing to our continued growth include (inaudible), hypersonics and modular reactors. Beginning with Zero Trust Architecture or ZTA. White House Executive Order, 14028, mandates, adoption of ZTA cybersecurity models across the federal government. Importantly, ZTA requires continuous verification of identity as movers as users move laterally through network systems. Jacobs' cyber intelligence team, which is now part of our new Divergent Solution operating unit is the program manager for one of the intelligence communities largest [directorates] responsible for Identity, Credential and Access Management, ICAM.\nICAM is a critical architectural component of effective Zero Trust models and Jacobs' technical leadership in this area positions us to help clients across the federal government, meet the White House executive order.\nOur cyber intelligence business unit has a significant pipeline of opportunities requiring ZTA adoption. In Q4, our cyber intelligence team also won several new non-ZTA contracts, including an agile software development and sustainment contract or a classified contract and one assisting the Navy to advance their radar sensing capability at the Naval Research Laboratory. We also recently cleared the protest period for a $470 million 6-year IDIQ, providing identity intelligence support to the DoD, which is not yet reflected in backlog.\nMoving on to hypersonics. With advances in hypersonic missile technology by China and Russia, the U.S. Department of Defense is developing missile defenses to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emergent missile threats. Because hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least Mach 5, roughly 1 mile per second and can maneuver in route to their target, they are more difficult to defend against. Jacobs has decades of experience supporting the U.S. Air Force and NASA and has positioned itself as a leader in hypersonic solutions.\nIn last quarter, Jacobs was awarded a 5-year $100 million IDIQ to help the U.S. Navy design and operate an underwater launch test system with the Naval Surface Warfare Center. The contract also covers modernization, design, fabrication and operation support for an in-air launch testing platform at the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake in California. Finally, demand for modular reactors. Nuclear power is coming into favor as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels.\nFor countries to achieve their next-zero carbon emission goals and ensure energy independence and security, leaders are realizing they need to include the always-on emission-free generation. Small modular reactors or SMRs are reactors with electric generating capacity of 300 megawatts versus traditional large reactors with generating capacity of 1 gigawatt or more. SMRs have numerous benefits, including lower initial capital investment, greater scalability through factory manufacturing processes, greater siding flexibility on smaller grid and isolated areas and greater energy efficiency.\nIn the U.K., we are delivering engineering and technical services to the Rolls-Royce SMR program and licensing advice to GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy as they look to enter the U.K. market. There's also increased interest in new advanced modular reactors or AMRs, that can be designed to provide specific benefits such as producing high heat for green hydrogen production. We are supporting multiple AMR vendors in the U.S. and U.K. Jacobs is a leader in global nuclear solutions, building on our long legacy of organic capabilities and acquisitions of CH2M and Wood Nuclear.\nIn summary, we continue to see solid revenue visibility for our solutions in FY '23 and with approximately 85% of CMS' portfolio, consisting of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than 4 years and 88% from federal level government funding. We are also pleased with the Government Accountability Office's recent guidance to have the U.S. Air Force reevaluate proposals for its large Integrated Support Contract, ISC 2.0, in support of a new source selection decision. And therefore, this remains in our pipeline as a potential multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nThe CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business at approximately $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile.\nMoving on to PA Consulting on Slide 8. PA continues to deliver its strategy and is securing exciting and enduring work. PA's deep client insight, lasting relationships and ability to assist clients through economic cycles is also generating consistent demand for its expertise.\nThis quarter, PA was awarded marketing wins across its key markets. As Steve mentioned, in the U.K. public sector, where it's a major player, PA was selected as the lead systems integrator for Crenic, a multiyear contract providing next-generation solutions to counter threats posed by radio-controlled improvised explosive devices, IEDs. The contract leverages PA's extensive experience in major program delivery as they lead the delivery consortium, Team Protect.\nPA was also appointed to oversee the delivery of a once-in-a-generation program for social care reform in the U.K., further cementing its position in government and public sector. Transport continues to be a major focus with additional awards won at Schipol Airport in the Netherlands, where the joint capabilities of Jacobs and PA continue to create further opportunities to include boardroom advisory and digitalization of airside operations.\nThe Jacobs PA partnership is strongly positioned to continue to capitalize on substantial market opportunities. Jacobs' global footprint and broad-based domain expertise together with PA's high-end digital consulting, creates a compelling value proposition in distinct areas of opportunity. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nPresident & CFO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year and net revenue grew 6% and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. All lines of businesses grew fourth quarter revenue over 9% versus a year ago in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% and improved slightly from the third quarter, but was approximately down 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by: one, our CMS line of business due to the newly ramped remediation contract; and two, investments in incremental employees in PA in advance of the large wins such as the U.K. MOD award that will ramp over the coming months.\nWe expect gross margins to modestly improve from Q4 levels during fiscal 2023, driven by recent wins in cyber, favorable revenue mix, recent wins in PA Consulting and continued strong performance in our People & Places Solutions business. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.2%, down 40 basis points from Q3 and down 200 basis points year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we benefited from lower labor expenses as we managed our cost structure. We are targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $309 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $14 million with over half associated with integration costs of acquisitions.\nAnd finally, a positive benefit from third-party recoveries of $27 million pretax, which we excluded from our adjusted results. Adjusted operating profit was therefore $347 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, it was up 19% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance.\nGAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.75 per share and included a $0.16 benefit from the third-party recovery receivable, a $0.12 benefit to align to our effective adjusted tax rate, offset by a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.06 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.80, up 14% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency.\nJacobs' consolidated Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $350 million and was up 13% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year. Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, backlog was impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar at year-end compared to the end of the third quarter. As an example, the dollar strengthened 8% versus the pound sterling from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4.\nAs a result, on a constant currency basis, backlog was flat sequentially. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.94x with our gross margin book-to-bill at 1.05x given a higher margin profile within backlog on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching Kennedy NASA rebid as backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded.\nNow moving to Slide 10 for a brief recap of our full year 2022 performance. (inaudible) year gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 10% in constant currency. On a reported basis, we expect fiscal 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digits and high single digits on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating profit was $918 million, up significantly year-over-year, driven by a material decrease in onetime items related to transaction and restructuring as well as solid underlying constant currency growth in the business.\nGAAP EPS was $4.98 and adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% year-over-year and up 13% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit grew 10.6% and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins expanded nearly 30 basis points to 10.4%, driven by revenue mix benefits and lower support costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 10% and up 12% in constant currency. As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%, up 20 basis points from fiscal 2021.\nWe expect modest adjusted operating profit margin expansion in fiscal 2023, driven by a combination of a higher margin revenue mix and lower employee-related costs. However, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be flat year-over-year as other income will be burdened primarily by unfavorable pension costs driven by the higher interest rate environment. On a trailing 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 0.97x and gross margin book-to-bill was over 1 at 1.05. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q4 performance and Slide 12 for full year performance.\nStarting with CMS. Q4 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% in constant currency. BlackLynx contributed approximately $22 million to the fourth quarter revenue. Fiscal 2020 (sic) [2022] revenue on a reported and constant currency basis grew 3% as the part of the year -- as the first part of the year did not benefit from the ramp of the Idaho nuclear remediation win. BlackLynx contributed $50 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the CMS business and higher double-digit growth in our Divergent Solutions unit.\nQ4 CMS operating profit was $95 million, down 17% year-over-year and down 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins as a result, were down 220 basis points year-over-year to 6.9%. Consistent with our previous outlook, Q4 operating margin percentage were impacted by a rate true-up in our cyber and intelligence business. The rate true-up was related to higher G&A over the course of the year given the slower ramp in the business during the continuing resolution.\nLooking forward, we have successfully been awarded a large new classified cyber win that was previously delayed during the continuing resolution, indicating developing momentum. Looking into fiscal 2023, we expect approximately 75 basis points of sequential operating margin expansion in Q1 and driven by immediate rebound from the onetime rate true-up in Q4. We're also targeting further margin expansion through fiscal 2023 as we win and ramp new higher-margin awards.\nMoving to People & Places Solutions. Overall, P&PS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 net revenue was up 6% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. On a constant currency basis, each P&PS region demonstrated net revenue growth. And for the full year, P&PS grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Looking deeper into our business units, our advanced facilities unit, which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and EV supply chains, posted another stellar quarter of double-digit revenue operating profit growth.\nFor the fiscal year, the business grew operating profit well north of 25%. We expect our advanced facilities growth rate to continue to remain robust during the fiscal year 2023 at approximately 10% despite the strong year-over-year comparisons. The P&PS International business, Q4 revenue and operating profit was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis, but grew double digits in constant currency. For the full year, international operating profit was up 10% year-over-year in constant currency.\nOur international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during fiscal 2023, resulting in flattish reported revenue growth, but is poised for full year growth on a constant currency basis. Total P&PS Q4 gross profit and margins were up year-over-year with Q4 operating profit up 31% and operating profit as a percentage of net revenue up 275 basis points, driven by revenue growth and mix as well as lower labor costs during the quarter. Full year People & Places operating profit was up 5.5% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency, with operating margins of 13.2%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago.\nIn terms of PA's performance, PA Q4 revenue declined 7.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, but it grew 9% in pound sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 19.4% during the quarter due to continued lower utilization and investments in pipeline pursuits. As Bob mentioned, PA Consulting has been successful winning the large Crenic award with the MOD for which we expect to show benefit later in 2023. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis with operating margins returning to above 20% throughout 2023, driven by improved utilization.\nOur non-allocated corporate costs were $28 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from lower incentive costs and to a lesser extent, from a positive currency impact on our supported costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated costs -- corporate costs to be $190 million to $210 million for fiscal 2023, which is slightly higher than fiscal year 2022 as we expect higher incentive costs on a year-over-year basis.\nNow turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $230 million in Q4 and included $12 million related to transaction costs and other items. On a full year basis, reported cash flow was $347 million, but included the net $475 million of cash outflows related to the previously announced Inpex settlement, the first $55 million repayment of Cares Act payroll tax deferral and a net $4 million cash benefit related to other items. Excluding these items, free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 97% for the year.\nFor fiscal 2023, we expect 2 items to impact cash flow an approximately net $15 million of further cash outflows from restructuring, transaction and other related costs. And a final repayment of $60 million of Cares Act payroll tax deferral benefits. Excluding these items, we anticipate again to achieve 100% free cash flow to adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2023. We are also continuing to evaluate further real estate opportunities given our developing insight as to our longer-term needs given the hybrid work environment, and we will update on our Q1 earnings call with further developments in this regard.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately $31 million of shares. And for the full year, we repurchased $282 million. After September, we have continued to be actively purchasing shares with approximately $135 million repurchased as of last week. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic and repurchasing shares as we see disruption in the market. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.4 billion, resulting in a $2.3 billion of net debt.\nOur Q4 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.6x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q4, approximately 60% of our debt is like the floating rate debt. And as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward, which we have incorporated into our outlook. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.6%. Early in the fourth quarter, we entered into a notional $500 million interest rate lock at a rate of 2.7% as related to a planned future fixed rate issuance.\nThe mark-to-market benefit from the in the money interest rate lock is currently recognized in other comprehensive income, but will offset interest expense of our future expected fixed income issuance. Also, in early October, we redeemed $481 million of private notes at par.\nIn the appendix on Slide 16 of the presentation, we included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which we announced at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and paid on October 28. I will now turn the call back over to Bob.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 14. As we discussed throughout our remarks, through proactive portfolio management, we have aligned our business to sectors that continue to demonstrate robust growth through multiple economic scenarios. We continue to enhance our overall growth rate with our climate response consulting and advisory and data solutions strategic accelerators. Given the volatility of FX rates, we are providing our outlook under 2 FX scenarios: one, an outlook based on constant currency, which provides greater insight of underlying business performance; and two, an outlook based on more recent FX rates.\nAlthough we transact in multiple currencies, one example for reference is the pound sterling. The full year 2022 average conversion rate for the pound sterling was $1.28 compared to $1.15 early November 2022. As footnoted in our earnings release and investor presentation, based on fiscal 2022 average rate, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.465 billion to $1.545 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.90, up 10% and 12%, respectively, at the midpoint. Based on rates in early November, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50, both up 6% at the midpoint.\nOn a net revenue basis, the difference between these 2 scenarios is approximately $430 million. Looking beyond fiscal 2023, we remain confident achieving double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, consistent with our strategic plan. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference.\n\nJonathan Doros\n\nVP of IR, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which will be referenced during the call.\nI'd like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, the current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including StreetLight Data and BlackLynx as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full fiscal period.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and the CEO of PA Consulting, Ken Toombs; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by reviewing our third quarter results and then discuss how Jacobs and PA are accelerating positive social impact. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. Ken will provide an update on PA Consulting. And Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide details on our updated outlook, along with some closing remarks. And then we'll open the call up for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions.\nWith that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our near-term outlook. We're excited to be conducting today's call from PA Consulting offices in London, and I'll provide more color in just a moment on our strong early on success of our investment in PA.\nBut first, turning to Slide 4. At Jacobs, the combination of a proactive approach to strategic portfolio management and driving a high-performance culture has created a top-quality business, with substantial recurring revenue that's resilient during a variety of macroeconomic conditions. This is complemented by our focus on secular growth in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions.\nOur competitive advantage is based on strength, staying true to our values. We harness our deep technical expertise to reinvent the way we solve problems and shape the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients.\nAs I shift to the quarterly results, we're clearly seeing strong underlying trends and accelerated growth at Jacobs. From the velocity of our sales pipeline, our recent major wins that we'll talk about today and next quarter, to increasing trends in utilization, we're positioned for strong profitable growth going forward.\nDuring the quarter, net revenue grew 8% year-over-year and double digit on a constant currency basis, with growth across each line of business. More importantly, bookings were strong across the company, resulting in revenue backlog up 10% year-over-year and actually up 13% in constant currency. We saw continued strong performance in our advanced facilities business, as demonstrated by our 25% year-over-year top line growth, and an acceleration in [TMTS] bookings during the quarter within our Americas business, driven by awards related to the U.S. infrastructure modernization.\nWithin Critical Mission Solutions, we were awarded a strategic $3.9 billion NASA Johnson 10-year rebid, significantly larger than our existing contract and which will be added to our backlog in the fourth quarter. This is one of many long-term recurring contracts that provide revenue visibility for the business.\nOn a constant currency basis, PA Consulting continued to show strong growth, with revenue up 22% and backlog up 19% year-over-year. The strong visibility of our diverse business with upside from secular growth trends, combined with robust cash flow generation, affords us the ability to generate returns for our shareholders through times of economic uncertainty.\nNow turning to Slide 5. This time 2 years ago, in the height of the pandemic, we were zeroing in on the PA Consulting transaction. And (inaudible) PA is significantly exceeding our financial expectations, and revenue synergies are accelerating. Results are strong across all PA's key performance indicators. In culture and talent, the number of partners has increased more than 20% since the transaction closed, with additional key hires across operations, research, technology and sales further strengthening PA's capabilities and client solution. And very exciting is their women and leadership program, with the current PA leadership team now at 50% female.\nFinancial performance continues strong, with the weighted pipeline up more than 40% compared to the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date revenues are up 20% in constant currency, with an operating margin of 21%, which is an indicator of PA's high-quality business. On the operations and strategy front, PA is seeing success following the launch of its IP monetization. And they are gaining momentum in the U.S. with new leadership in an expanding portfolio. And in the area of revenue synergies, we have posted 18 joint wins since the beginning of the partnership and are seeing significant collaborative opportunities in multiple markets, including health and life sciences, energy and utilities and consumer products. Our partnership with PA has been one of the most successful and value-creating investments, and our Consulting & Advisory accelerator is a clear priority for future capital deployment.\nTurning to Slide 6. A key to our successful partnership has been the close alignment of our purpose around creating solutions that have positive social impact. Whether it's working together to improve health care for families through leading-edge cell and gene therapy; addressing patient safety and emergency departments across the U.S.; solving issues of connectivity and decarbonization for global rail market; delivering resilient solutions in the areas of deforestation and fire prevention in the U.K. and the undergrounding of 10,000 miles of cable for PG&E to mitigate forest fires in California; and on the clean energy front, collaborating on analyzing investments for private equity in clean hydrogen. Once again, looking ahead, we believe our partnership with PA is critical to delivering our new Jacobs strategy.\nNow I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to discuss our line of business.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued its strong performance in the third quarter, with total backlog increasing 7% on a reported basis -- reported and pro forma basis to $10.2 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Our service and solution offerings are delivered across our core customers' markets: space, national security, cyber and intelligence and energy environment. And we are leveraging our growth accelerators of Data Solutions, Climate Response and Consulting & Advisory to catalyze the business.\nWe have substantial revenue visibility as approximately 85% of CMS' portfolio consists of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than 4 years and 88% from federal-level government funding. Although economic and geopolitical uncertainties continue, our strong Q3 ending backlog gives us confidence in our next 12 months forecasted revenue. Three market trends that we see contributing to our continued growth include: space debris management, robotics and 5G network buildout.\nBeginning with space debris management. Decades of space travel resulted in large amounts of space debris damage today's satellites and future launches, adding to the cost of operating satellite and other space platforms, like the International Space Station, or ISS. If debris destroys a satellite, it could take months and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to restore the service. We support the orbital debris tracking program at NASA and provide plume analysis and communication systems simulation for vehicles visiting the ISS. In addition, we provide meteor tracking data for multiple government agencies. Space retracting is one of many services Jacobs provides on the recently awarded Johnson Engineering, Technology, and Science, or JETS II contract, which builds on Jacobs' more than 17 years of continuous support at Johnson Space Center. Under this contract, we will provide multidisciplinary technical services to support the future of human space exploration as well as help NASA incubate the emerging commercial space economy. This 10-year $3.9 billion win will book in Q4 and represents a $1.8 billion increase to our existing contract. This service illustrates the continuing strong massive Jacobs partnership.\nMoving on to robotics. We are increasingly delivering valued solutions to our clients by utilizing robots that reduce costs and increase accuracy and safety in otherwise manual human processes. And we're excited to announce that last quarter, we integrated the Resolve Robotics team in the U.K. into CMS, who brings software expertise and IP to help accelerate our growth.\nOur existing CMS robotics team already delivers groundbreaking innovations, developing and deploying robotic systems in challenging environments, such as the robotic tool to retrieve sand-like debris from inside a damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima in Japan, autonomous systems to map riverbeds for the British Army and designing robotic systems for ITER, the world's largest fusion power experiment.\nFinally, demand for 5G telecommunications. Our telecom group provides full solutions for the deployment of next-generation wireless and wireline networks for leading telecommunication companies like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile as well as Fortune 1000 health care and commercial companies looking to build their own 5G networks. We also support the infrastructure market, providing 5G integration, network optimization and technical services alongside our P&PS teams to accelerate growth.\nWhile rollout of 5G infrastructure deployment is still in its early ramp phase, we continue to see increased demand for both integrated 4G and 5G solutions from our commercial telco, infrastructure, health care and government clients. During the quarter, our telecom group added several new awards totaling more than $150 million to deliver projects advancing 5G nationwide. We are excited for the team's recent successes and are well positioned for growth as adoption of 5G use cases and penetration grow.\nIn summary, we continue to see solid demand for our CMS solutions. Last week, we were notified that we were awarded a $470 million 6-year cyber and intelligence-related task order, which we expect to benefit beginning -- begin ramping at the end of this current quarter. The sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business pipeline at approximately $25 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile.\nTurning to Slide 8. During the quarter, People & Places Solutions delivered record-setting quarterly bookings that top pre-pandemic levels. We also enjoyed year-over-year bookings growth of 11% and backlog growth of 13%, delivering a high mark for operating profit in the quarter. Despite macroeconomic concerns, we performed well due to the balance of public and private sector clients with a multinational focus, resulting in continued high percentage of revenue already booked in backlog.\nAs I talk about the quarter, I'll address our 4 ongoing themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization, climate response and data solutions.\nStarting with supply chain diversification. With continued breakthroughs in biotechnology, strong customer demand and robust operating cash flow, life sciences clients are investing in manufacturing expansion and contract operations capacity globally. As a leader in the market, Tier 1 clients have confidence in Jacobs' ability to deliver highly complex greenfield and expansion projects at speed that provides time to market for our clients to maximize their competitive advantage in new therapeutics.\nGrowing health service needs are leading to innovative approaches to care. We are optimizing facilities for clients such as the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, where we serve as their project delivery partner. We are improving sustainability access and energy efficiency for NHS Scotland as well as increasing much-needed access to critical mental health care in Australia.\nWe continue to see robust demand for semiconductor chips, data center capacity expansion and growth in the electric vehicle market and have secured recent confidential wins in all 3 categories. On top of strong secular demand for semiconductors, we are pleased to see the passing of the $53 billion U.S. CHIPS bill, which will incentivize investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and specialized tooling.\nInfrastructure modernization. Increased client investments in mega and gigascale infrastructure continues. And with our #1 ENR ranking and program management, our delivery reputation has been a key differentiator in staying ahead of our clients' needs in a dynamic global environment. We recently have been awarded several strategic full life cycle programs for new transformative scale cities in the Middle East that will address social, economic and climate priorities and will have flexible and long-term contracting vehicles. With a renewed interest in equitable, sustainable transportation, we are experiencing a significant investment in the transit and rail sector with wins across the globe, such as Irish Rail, British Railways, multiple clients in Australia and resilient transit planning for Sacramento Area Council of Governments here in the U.S.\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is resulting in a steady increase in new project awards to modernize and increase the resiliency of U.S. infrastructure. For example, we won a major water supply resilience program for Eastern New Mexico Water Utility Authority, a 5-year stormwater implementation program for the city of Baton Rouge, and a funding strategy with Oklahoma DOT. Additionally, our IIJA advisory team is positioning our clients to win funding opportunities, with over 50 differentiated grant applications across transportation, water and energy. We anticipate additional awards in the coming quarters as the opportunities in our sales pipeline move into the next phase of procurement.\nMoving to Climate Response. We see our clients continuing to invest in clean energy across all sectors, with primary spend related to grid modernization, cost-effective renewable energy generation and EV charging infrastructure, or EVCI. Our progress in these areas is demonstrated globally: in Asia, through advisory and policy consulting for the Asian Development Bank; in Canada, with a pipeline utility program; in Australia, through transmission and distribution design projects with AusNet Services; and in the U.S. via a new consulting and advisory framework to advance energy transition with a leading provider.\nTransportation electrification and advanced charging infrastructure plans have topped our clients' agendas across all regions for aviation, sports, highway and rail and transit. This includes projects for Heathrow Airport in the U.K. to implement landside EVCI, Ohio DOT statewide EV infrastructure program and a major U.S. transportation authority transitioning operations to zero emissions for one of the world's largest bus fleets by 2040. Collectively, this is a very exciting space for us and aligns strongly with our Climate Response accelerator.\nMoving to Data Solutions. We are using advanced data analytics to optimize our clients' decision-making as well as their ability to derisk long-term investments. For example, in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board, our StreetLight Data team is using advanced analytics to better measure and manage transportation emission. We are also continuing our technology consulting support for a U.S. state DOT with integrated corridor management, connected automated transportation systems and other advanced mobility solutions to maximize use of their existing transportation infrastructure.\nIn the water market, we were awarded a contract with The Water Research Foundation to develop the first full-scale deployment of machine learning, predictive control for wastewater systems, a new technology to advance the global water industry. Our cyber and digital services teams were awarded projects in support of the operational technology resiliency plan for a major U.K. utility network operator. And in Australia, we have secured the digital and data advisory services scope to support advanced analytics across Brisbane City Council's entire asset life cycle.\nIn summary, our strong sales pipeline is supported by well-funded government budgets to modernize their infrastructure and commercial clients that are addressing secular growth opportunities. The agility of our global workforce, combined with elevated spend on transformative, complex infrastructure uniquely positions us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Given these dynamics and the visibility of our revenue and backlog, we are excited in the growth trajectory for our People & Places business, both now and into the future.\nAs Steve mentioned, we are impressed with PA's strong results, which underscores the strategic logic for our investment. We're excited to be joined by PA's CEO, Ken Toombs, who'll provide a quarterly update. Ken, over to you.\n\nKen Toombs\n\nCEO & Director, PA Consulting Group Limited\n\nThanks, Bob. Moving to Slide 9. PA's current quarter continued to see strong sales bookings, up 25% and backlog was up 19% in constant currency. Here's what I see driving that. We have unique value proposition that starts with our purpose, bringing ingenuity to life to build a positive human future. This enables us to deliver both financial\n(technical difficulty)\nOur purpose is critical in our ability to attract and retain top talent. Our differentiation extends to our strategy, which is focused on helping clients address some of the biggest forces shaping society with our unique end-to-end innovation offering. Indeed, having technologists, scientists, engineers and designers working together creates a unique set of propositions.\nLet me shift gears and talk a bit about our partnership with Jacobs. As Steve mentioned, our partnership supports key aspects of our strategy. We have numerous key accounts in common. Those accounts are ones where we can leverage PA's relationships at the C-suite to bring Jacobs into the mix early and create a differentiated solution. In some cases, it could be the advantage of scale that Jacobs has or a specialized expertise.\nIt can also work the opposite way where Jacobs has a key relationship and brings PA into complex deals. A great example is PG&E in California, where Jacobs has a strong existing relationship. The differentiation on this project was a combination of Jacobs' program management expertise with PA's strategic consultancy advise and deep domain expertise. And more than a year into the partnership, these types of opportunities are growing.\nAnother area of our strategy is expansion in the United States, where the outlook is very promising, with strong double-digit revenue growth over the last 6 months. Beyond the synergies with Jacobs, we see a big demand for our end-to-end services. We're focused on 3 sectors, in particular: energy and utilities; health and life sciences; and consumer and manufacturing. In each of these areas, we're winning and delivering exciting purpose-driven work.\nFor example, innovating cell and gene therapy manufacturing with Ori Biotech and creating a growth strategy for Green Boom, a start-up, which has developed a sustainable (inaudible) to prevent, reduce and clean up oil spills. Over time, we've made several U.S. acquisitions, which have provided a platform for further organic growth. Additionally, the significant hiring of great new talent at the partner level is another way we are stimulating growth. Since the beginning of 2020, we've grown the number of U.S. partners by 60%.\nNow I'd like to spend a minute on resiliency of our business. We enjoy a loyal client base, with approximately 90% of revenue typically coming from repeat clients over the last 5 years. And our expertise continues to be in high demand. We also enjoy resiliency given our balance between private and public sector work. For example, during the pandemic, we transformed the entire corporate business models to account for new customer behaviors. While in the public sector, we work with some of the biggest government agencies that provide critical services that are largely unaffected by short-term budget decisions, like the U.K. National Health Service and Ministry of Justice. This helps to mitigate risk from future macroeconomic trends.\nSo to summarize, we're running a purpose-driven business with a clear strategy to address our clients' biggest challenges in an end-to-end manner that separates us from the competition. And structurally, we're set up to be able to pivot in response to external factors, ensuring we're well positioned for the future.\nKevin, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nPresident & CFO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken. I'm going to turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 7% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Pro forma for our acquired revenue, net revenue also grew 7% year-over-year, which is an acceleration in growth from the second quarter. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly 400 basis points. And given current foreign exchange spot rates, we expect FX to impact our Q4 revenue by nearly 450 basis points on a year-over-year basis. On a reported basis for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, which translates into double-digit growth on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, down 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by our CMS line of business related to newly ramping remediation contracts and the timing of the ramp on higher-margin federal contracts and the investment in incremental resources in PA in advance of expected growth. We expect gross margins to marginally improve in the fourth quarter and expand further during fiscal 2023, driven by a higher-margin backlog and sales pipeline, favorable revenue mix within CMS, an acceleration in P&PS revenue and continued strong PA performance.\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, down nearly 100 basis points from Q2 and down 130 basis points year-over-year. We expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to remain at this level in Q4 as we balance our investments to support growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nGAAP operating profit was $266 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $10 million, with over half of that associated with integration costs associated with acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit was $327 million, up 4% year-over-year on both a reported and pro forma basis. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.3%, and we expect a similar level in Q4. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance.\nGAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.52 and included a $0.27 impact related to our amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.04 from transaction-related costs, only $0.02 of other restructuring costs and a $0.01 benefit adjustment to align to our effective tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.86, up 13% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, FX impacted our EPS negatively by $0.09.\nWithin the other income line on the P&L, important to note, we realized a cash pretax gain of approximately $14 million or $0.08 in after-tax EPS from the sale of our ownership in commercial cybersecurity provider, WatchGuard Technologies, that came as part of the KeyW acquisition. This benefit was captured within our other income line and adjusted EBITDA, but not reflected in operating profit results. The sale of this strategic investment was driven by contract terms associated with our interest, which would have limited future monetization of our investment. We remain excited about our continued partnership with WatchGuard.\nJacobs' consolidated Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $363 million and was up nearly 13% year-over-year, representing 11.4% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year.\nFinally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x and did not include the estimated $550 million backlog value of the 10-year $3.9 billion NASA Johnson win, which we'll recognize in backlog in our fourth quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, the contract savings of this rebid win is significantly higher than our existing contract and is an agency-wide contract not limited to Johnson Space Center. We plan to backlog the first 2 years of the approximate current revenue run rate, but expect on-contract growth to the ceiling value over the life of the contract.\nRegarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS. Q3 revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by over 200 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to approach double-digits, and after adjusting for an estimated FX impact of 250 basis points, deliver constant currency double-digit growth.\nQ3 CMS operating profit was $104 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, but flat on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was down over 90 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Q3 operating profit and margin percentage continued to be impacted by the delay of the higher-margin, shorter-cycle awards that were pushed to the right due to the continuing resolution as well as related timing of our investments ahead of new cyber and intelligence contract wins. Due to these investments and the timing of both new and anticipated awards, we expect CMS operating profit margin to remain under 8% for the fourth quarter, but improving in 2023 and beyond.\nMoving to People & Places. Q3 net revenue accelerated to 7% year-over-year growth, including a negative effect of 350 basis points from FX. On a constant currency basis, P&PS overall grew double digits year-over-year. Also on a constant currency basis, each People & Places segment demonstrated net revenue growth, with strong year-over-year growth acceleration in our Americas business as impact from U.S. infrastructure spending begins to materialize.\nOur advanced facilities business continues to demonstrate robust double-digit net revenue growth, with strong performance in both semiconductor and life sciences. We expect this performance to continue given our strong backlog and sales pipeline. Our international business growth on a constant currency basis also remains strong as those governments continue to prioritize infrastructure modernization and investments related to our ESG solutions.\nTotal P&PS Q3 gross profit grew year-over-year, and gross margins were consistent with Q3 2021, with Q3 operating profit up 2% year-over-year and up 8% when eliminating the impact from FX translation.\nIn terms of PA's performance, PA revenue grew 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, an impressive 22% in PA's local currency. Q3 adjusted operating profit margin was 18.5% due to lower utilization, but still up 2% when factoring the impact of currency. The lower utilization during Q3 was driven by a proactive effort to add resources for additional growth expected in 2022 and 2023 for the PA team. Consequently, we expect PA's operating profit margin to return to greater than 20% next quarter and continue to strengthen further in 2023. We also expect continued double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis.\nOur nonallocated corporate costs were $38 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from continuing moderation in medical costs, and to a lesser extent, from a positive currency impact on our support costs and other benefits. We now expect nonallocated corporate costs to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million versus our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022.\nTurning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid underlying cash flow generation. On a reported basis, free cash flow was a negative $281 million, but included a $480 million cash outflow related to the previously discussed INPEX legal settlement as well as $10 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding these outflows, free cash flow was strong and conversion was in line with our expectations. DSOs were relatively flat year-over-year. We expect solid free cash flow in the fourth quarter, again, in line with our previous conversion expectations for the full year.\nDuring the quarter, we've repurchased approximately $200 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares as we see dislocation in the market. As a result of the strong underlying cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and a gross debt of $3.6 billion, resulting in $2.5 billion of net debt. Our net debt to adjusted 2022 expected EBITDA of approximately 1.8x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate prepayable debt. And as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward, which we have incorporated into our outlook. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which we recently announced.\nBefore I turn it back to Steve, I'd like to talk about the resiliency of our portfolio. The portfolio is strong and resilient, aligned around high-priority federal government spend areas and state and local institutions supported by government stimulus programs. The private sector business is centered on high-margin markets like semiconductors and life sciences, which are currently focused on incremental investment in capacity to resolve supply chain constraints and support novel therapies. As a result, while we may not be totally immune to the global economic uncertainties, we're confident that we are positioned to deliver the level of growth identified in our strategy.\nOver to you, Steve.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Kevin. As Kevin described, we have a diverse portfolio with significant reimbursable recurring revenue. It provides us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios and manage the impacts of inflationary pressures on our business. With this diversity comes some exposure to foreign currency translation, as we have approximately 34% of our revenue outside of the U.S., with 21% of that revenue in U.K. pound sterling.\nAs a result of the latest foreign exchange dynamics, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter of adjusted EBITDA in the range of $340 million to $360 million and an adjusted EPS of $1.75 to $1.85, with the midpoints tied to the current FX rates. We feel very confident in our underlying business trends in the fourth quarter and have provided the lower end of the range to reflect the possibility of any FX erosion.\nIt is important to note that relative to our fiscal 2022 forecast back in November, foreign currency translation has impacted our full year expected fiscal 2022 net revenue outlook by approximately $320 million, adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million and adjusted EPS by nearly $0.20. So in short, our change in annual guidance and EPS is effectively driven by currency volatility versus our original expectations.\nIn closing, we are excited about the momentum across all of our business as demonstrated by our accelerating revenue growth, our strong bookings and backlog and a robust sales pipeline globally.\nOperator, we'll now open the call for questions."

My name is Savannah, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Doros\n\nVP of IR, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Savannah. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which will be referenced during the call.\nI would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, the current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including StreetLight Data and BlackLynx as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full period.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and then discuss the launch of our Climate Action Plan. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. And Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide some details on our updated outlook, along with the closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for your questions.\nThroughout the presentation and in the appendix of this presentation, we provide additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, John. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and an update on our newly launched strategy.\nIn March, we shared the details of our new strategy, Boldly Moving Forward, which unleashes a culture of inclusion, innovation and inspiration across Jacobs, enabling us to execute against one of the most exciting periods in our company's history. Our excitement surrounding the new strategy is driven by multiple robust growth opportunities across all lines of business with additional opportunities to accelerate our performance in the areas of climate response, consulting and advisory and data solutions.\nFor those that are new to Jacobs, we are a professional services company that combines deep technical knowledge across a variety of scientific, engineering and technology disciplines with cutting-edge proprietary solutions. We serve a diverse set of sectors and global clients that are navigating the need to modernize their infrastructure and supply chains, protect national security while embarking upon multi-year digital transformations across all facets of their operational environments. This dynamic creates a compelling opportunity for decades of growth for Jacobs. By staying true to our values and purpose, we are a company like no other, reinventing the way we solve problems and shaping the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients.\nDuring the quarter, net revenue grew 10% year-over-year with growth across each line of business. Bookings were strong across the company, resulting in our revenue backlog up 9% year-over-year with an improving gross profit profile. We were awarded a record level of higher-margin professional services and People & Places Solutions, including several strategic wins, developing grants that will enable our clients to access funds from the U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act as well as an increasing number of larger opportunities entering our sales pipeline.\nCritical Mission Solutions benefited from the large space intelligence win we disclosed last quarter. And PA Consulting had another outstanding quarter with 15% reported year-over-year revenue growth and 19% growth in constant currency while delivering adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our advanced facilities business continues to achieve record year-over-year growth rates, driven by wins in the semiconductor, life sciences and electric vehicle sectors.\nGiven our increased visibility and confidence for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook with no change to the midpoint. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to expect strong organic growth with healthy cash flow conversion that affords us the ability to deploy capital for enhanced value creation.\nTurning to Slide 5. As we outlined during our new strategy launch, we are a purpose-led company with deep domain knowledge and a track record of delivering solutions to combat the global climate crisis. With this sense of urgency top of mind, we have made significant achievements both internally and externally with approximately $6 billion in revenue driven from ESG and climate-related solutions. We are playing a pivotal role in mitigating one of our generation's greatest threats. Working with our clients, we are co-creating solutions in energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation, resilience, national resource stewardship and ESG business transformation.\nSimilarly, we have delivered on our corporate commitments through our significant emissions reductions and carbon neutrality status. And in April, we took another major step and launched our updated Climate Action Plan to align our net-zero commitments with a new recognized international standard. Our ambitious commitments include ensuring every client project we undertake becomes a client response opportunity, achieving net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutrality with 100% low-carbon electricity for our operations. I'm also proud to share that we are one of the world's first companies and the first consultancy organization to have validated net-zero targets approved by our Science Based Targets initiative.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued its strong backlog performance in the second quarter, increasing 8% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion.\nOur CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. This strategy is underpinned by our focus on key capabilities tied to our growth accelerators, data and cyber solutions, climate response and consulting and advisory, across our core customer markets of national security, space and energy. Three market trends that we are seeing offering continued strong growth this year and beyond include all-source intelligence, energy transition and space exploration.\nBeginning with all-source intelligence. The increasing intelligence threat levels require analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature, to allow for better real-time decision-making. All-source intelligence offerings are advancing to include specialized collection management, visualization and dissemination as a service, aligned to specific threats like drug trafficking, organized crime and threat finance.\nJacobs cyber and intelligence business has a full spectrum of all-source intelligence solutions to guide our national security clients through these increasingly sophisticated digital threats. In the second quarter, Jacobs won the U.S. Army's Intelligence Operations Support contract to provide comprehensive 24/7 all-source intelligence analysis to the Army's Joint Task Force, combatant commands and Service Component Commands. Also, we were awarded a seat on the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's Data Readiness for AI Development, which encompasses all tasks required to prepare, manage and secure data sets in DoD AI models and assist DevSecOps.\nMoving on to energy transition. Nuclear energy, along with renewables, are critical components of the global energy portfolio to transition economies away from fossil fuels. There is now a growing recognition that to achieve net zero, we must include the always-on, emission-free generation that only nuclear power can provide. Every year, nuclear power averts 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 217 million cars. Power generated from nuclear provides stability and resilience to electrical grids due to its unique ability to ensure 24/7 energy supply, regardless of weather conditions.\nAnd Jacobs is well positioned as a leader in delivering global nuclear solutions. We were recently awarded a contract by EDF Energy, operator of the Sizewell B nuclear plant located in Suffolk, U.K. to support the extension of the station's operating life by 20 years to 2055. Another aspect of our nuclear science expertise is our strong remediation capabilities. Our environmental team has successfully phased in the Idaho Cleanup Project at the Idaho National Laboratory and won the Oak Ridge Reservation Contract to perform environmental remediation work for the Department of Energy in Eastern Tennessee.\nFinally, demand for space exploration. In March, Jacobs supported NASA in rolling out the fully integrated Space Launch System for the Artemis I mission with launch to occur this summer. Artemis I will be the first uncrewed flight mission in NASA's deep space human exploration program. The Artemis program aims to return humans to the moon by 2025, including the first woman and first person of color. Also for NASA, we were recently awarded the NASA Ames test operations and maintenance contract, the fifth consecutive victory for Jacobs on this contract, which we originally won in 1998. This 5-year $220 million win will book in Q3 but highlights the continuing and strong NASA-Jacobs partnership.\nThis quarter, Jacobs was also awarded a contract from Australia's Department of Defence Space Command to support the implementation of new space capabilities in deep space advanced radar, ground-based electrooptical deep space surveillance and space control. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our solutions in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The CMS pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business at more than $25 billion, including $15 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile.\nNow on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Our strategy is being actualized in real time with strong quarter backlog performance at 9% growth while building sales momentum across multiple markets and geographies, specifically in our advanced manufacturing, health and life sciences and U.S. infrastructure markets. I will discuss the P&P results under the themes of supply chain diversification, climate response, data solutions and infrastructure monetization.\nStarting with supply chain diversification. We continue to respond to increasing demand and supply chain realignment that secures supply for health and life sciences and semiconductor manufacturing. For example, we are seeing an expansion of both organic and contract manufacturing for life sciences capacity in the U.S., Ireland and Denmark. And in Singapore, we are bringing a world-class team of clinical specialists and facility experts to reimagine sustainable patient-centered care models for expanded facilities at Alexandra Hospital.\nTo address the global semiconductor shortage, Jacobs is leveraging global resources, expertise and design automation to deliver critical capacity expansion for multiple semiconductor manufacturing clients in the U.S. and Europe. In a related industry, Jacobs is working with clients in all phases of the electric vehicle ecosystem, implementing state-of-the-art facilities that co-locate lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle production to improve system delays and resilience. Across geographies, alternative fuel planning continues to drive investment for transportation agencies with recent awards for Michigan and Nevada DOT to unlock U.S. Infrastructure Act funding.\nMoving to climate response. Jacobs remains on the forefront of advising our clients on true carbon impacts in areas ranging from biodegradable materials with an award from NatureWorks to embodied carbon calculations with a recent study for a major data center client. We are seeing material pipeline growth in our climate response and energy transition portfolio as evidenced by wins with National Grid in the U.K. to deliver innovative clean energy transmission; a wind farm in Australia; large coastal resiliency programs in Louisiana; and an offshore wind project in the northeastern United States to convert an underutilized port to support one of the largest, most advanced offshore wind facilities in the country. In addition, our innovation investments in PFAS solutions have resulted in an award for its first-of-its-kind program to study nature-based remediation options at more than 35 airports across Australia.\nMoving to data solutions. Our deep domain expertise, combined with our digital platforms, bring world-class technology-enabled solutions to our clients. Our recent acquisition, StreetLight, is working with Siemens and New York state to forecast impacts of renewables and EV charging infrastructure to plan strategic investment upgrades. In the U.K., Jacobs and PA Consulting are transforming Hampshire with multi-sector digital-enabled solutions to support economic growth, social equity and environmental protection. Additionally, we've had an exciting new win for smart, connected and secure infrastructure with national highways and confidential manufacturing clients.\nNow discussing infrastructure modernization. Faced with aging infrastructure and financial and social equity challenges, Jacobs is helping our clients reimagine infrastructure. In Melbourne, our delivery excellence resulted in a renewed contract with Yarra Valley Water, representing up to 18 years of partnership. In Los Angeles, we are expanding our legacy of being a trusted adviser to the Department of Water and Power by delivering a $17 billion master plan development for water reuse facilities. And for the Port of Alaska, we were recently awarded a contract extension to create a safer, more efficient and resilient port with coastal protection.\nThis quarter, we saw significant growth in rail and transit with two clients awarding Jacobs their largest expansion ever. This includes an underground rail line in Singapore and New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority's leveraging of the U.S. Infrastructure Act to strengthen the regional rail system and equitably bridge communities. We also expanded our portfolio in Continental Europe in partnership with NIRAS with two 8-year framework agreements for the Copenhagen Metro and The Greater Copenhagen Light Rail. Overall, we're seeing double-digit pipeline growth that is strengthening due to global infrastructure stimulus across transportation, water, energy and environment as well as advanced manufacturing.\nTurning to PA Consulting on Slide 8. As Steve mentioned, PA had another impressive quarter. Their unique digital consultancy services enables clients to accelerate new growth ideas from concept through to commercial success. This allows PA to capitalize quickly and efficiently on global trends and growth markets, such as climate response and health and life sciences. Specifically in the health market, PA continues to use its skills as a force for good and is currently advising the American College of Emergency Physicians on how to build and operate a first-of-its-kind national registry. This next-generation digital platform will transform health care for the nation's infants, children, adolescents and young adults.\nFocusing on climate response, there are two examples which demonstrate the breadth of PA's capabilities. The first is for the U.K. government, where PA provided consultancy services for a launch of a new infrastructure fund to drive the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country. Secondly, PA and the Swedish R&D and IP company, PulPac, continue to accelerate their exclusive global development partnership for their revolutionary patented technology. PulPac uses renewable pulp and cellulose to produce fiber-based packaging and single-use products as an alternative to plastics, creating up to an 80% lower CO2 footprint. The partnership recorded three strategic confidential wins this quarter and have developed a solid go-to-market plan for the United States.\nIt is evident from all these examples that PA continues to be a crucial part of our strategy with their alignment to Jacobs' three growth accelerators. I had the privilege of joining the 1-year PA Consulting and Jacobs celebratory roadshow last month, attending sessions at 6 different PA offices in 4 different countries. PA's CEO, Ken Toombs, and I met over 1,300 PA employees with extremely positive feedback. We continue to build on collective success during our first year. And I look forward to continued collaborative successes for our clients and the world.\nI'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nPresident & CFO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob, and good day to all that are joining us on the call today. I'd like to turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter fiscal 2022 results.\nSecond quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year, although net revenue grew 10% and was up 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points. And given current spot FX rates, we expect FX pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. Exiting Q2, we fully lapped the impact from the lower-margin CMS procurement contract and the timing difference between our two large environmental remediation contracts. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect total net revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26.6%, up 80 basis points, driven by improvement in People & Places and PA's improved mix impact, partially offset by the revenue ramp from the large new environmental remediation project win in CMS. Looking past 2022, as we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix, we expect our gross margins to continue to expand.\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 16.5%, down slightly from our first quarter. Within G&A, we are making investments to prepare for the increase in opportunities from the recently passed U.S. infrastructure stimulus as well as other investments to improve the efficiency of business through our Focus 2023 initiative. We expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to trend lower for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nGAAP operating profit was $166 million and was mainly impacted by a $99 million charge associated with the legacy CH2M matter we disclosed in April and other related legal costs. Also included in GAAP operating profit was $48 million of amortization costs from acquired intangibles. Other acquisition deal costs and restructuring efforts were $18 million with around half related to acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 7% year-over-year and down slightly on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.1%.\nGAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 per share and included: a $0.63 charge related to the settlement of the previously mentioned legacy CH2M matter and related legal costs; a $0.25 impact related to our amortization charge of acquired intangibles; $0.09 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continued to trend significantly lower; and a $0.07 impact from a higher tax rate in the quarter versus our expected rate for the full year. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.72.\nJacobs' consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $340 million and was up nearly 3% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was just under 1x at 0.94x but was 1.12x on a gross profit basis as we saw a continued increase in profitability in our backlog.\nRegarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q2 revenue was up 4% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by nearly 100 basis points. During the quarter, CMS revenue growth lapped the impact from the contract runoff of a lower-margin large procurement contract and benefited from the timing of our large DOE environmental remediation win at Idaho.\nAs a result, we expect CMS revenue to show double-digit second half 2022 revenue growth, driven by: strong performance in space intelligence from our recent large new award; continued increase from the large environmental contracts to its expected full run rate; accelerating performance in our telecom business, driven by our strategic relationships with 5G providers; and cyber and intel awards delayed during the continuing resolution beginning to ramp.\nQ2 CMS operating profit was $113 million, down 1%. Operating profit margin was down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%. As expected, operating margins were impacted by the ramp-up of our large environmental remediation win and the delay of the higher-margin, shorter-cycle awards that were pushed to the right due to the continuing resolution. We expect operating profit margin to trend slightly above Q2 levels for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\nMoving to People & Places. Q2 net revenue was up 2.8% year-over-year and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from foreign exchange. Our advanced facilities business net revenue growth again was up double digits year-over-year, driven by investments in the semiconductor and pharma supply chains. We expect continued robust growth from advanced facilities throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong Q2 year-over-year growth despite the impact from currency, driven by more steady government funding. For the second half of fiscal 2022, we expect net revenue growth from our international business to moderate with pressure from the unfavorable impact of FX.\nMoving to People & Places Americas. Net revenue growth in Q2 improved from Q1, driven by front-end work related to the infrastructure stimulus. We are seeing the benefit from the budget resolution, a meaningful build in our 12- to 18-month pipeline from the infrastructure stimulus projects. Our second quarter gross margin bookings and pipeline provides us confidence in sequential gross profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 versus the first half. Total P&PS Q2 gross profit grew year-over-year, but Q2 operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by increased G&A expenses as we continued to spend against strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term.\nIn terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $297 million in revenue and $68 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q2 revenue grew 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 19% in constant currency. Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 23%. As a quick reminder, PA grew revenue in constant currency 24% year-over-year for fiscal year 2021 and delivered a 23% operating profit margin, thus making year-to-date revenue and margin performance even more impressive. Our non-allocated corporate expenses were $41 million, up year-over-year and within our expectations as medical costs moderated. We now expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be at the lower end of our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022.\nLet's turn now to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid cash flow generation with $96 million in reported free cash flow, which was in line with our expectations, given the timing of PA employee tax-related costs associated with our annual bonus payments and the net working capital impact of discrete items, which effectively offset each other. DSOs ticked up modestly year-over-year, driven by the timing of new CMS wins and the ramp of the large environment Idaho win in our CMS line of business.\nThe quarter's cash flow included a net $40 million cash benefit related to monetizing an Australian dollar FX hedge related to the CH2M legal matter settlement, partially offset by cash restructuring. To date, since March, we have repurchased approximately $135 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistically repurchase our shares.\nNext quarter, we expect free cash flow to be affected by the gross cash settlement of the CH2M-related legal matter of $480 million with nearly $100 million in cash tax benefits, partially offsetting that amount over the next few quarters. Adjusting for the impact of the legal settlement and our other restructuring items, we remain on track toward achieving our one-time free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income target and expect similar or better free cash flow conversion going forward.\nAs a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in $2 billion of net debt. Pro forma for the legal settlement and including our estimated second half cash flow, we expect Q4 net debt to adjusted 2022 EBITDA of approximately 1.5x, a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which we recently announced.\nNow I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide 14.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Our diverse portfolio has proven resilient, providing us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios with an asset-light business model and the ability to manage pricing during an inflationary environment. Given our increased visibility and confidence for fiscal 2022, we are tightening our outlook and maintaining the midpoint guidance.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.435 billion from the $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion previous guidance. And our adjusted EPS outlook is now in the range of $6.95 to $7.35 from $6.85 to $7.45 previously. Looking past fiscal 2022, our backlog performance and increasing sales pipeline provides us with continued conviction in achieving the multiyear financial growth targets we provided during our March strategy launch.\nOperator, we'll now open the call for questions."

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs' Fiscal First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference.\n\nJonathan Doros\n\nVP of IR, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including BlackLynx, as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full period.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. Before turning to the agenda, I would like to share that on Friday, March 4, we'll be releasing a digital deep dive of our new Jacobs strategy. We also plan to attend the Raymond James Investor Conference on March 7 in Orlando and the BofA Global Industrials Conference on March 15 in London.\nNow to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be our Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we're making against our strategy and then discuss our data solutions strategy, including the acquisition of StreetLight Data. Bob will then review our performance by line of business, and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of PA Consulting's financial profile as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.\nFinally, Steve will provide detail on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and then we'll open the call to your questions. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solution. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our key strategic initiatives. As we've stated before, we're on the front end of a multiyear growth cycle for the company. This is driven by a combination of secular growth opportunities in our core sectors such as U.S. infrastructure investments, climate response, a supercycle of supply chain investments in electronics as well as being at the nexus of disruptive new technologies in domains of space, cyber and software analytics. We expect these opportunities to drive accelerated revenue growth for the balance of the year.\nLooking into 2025 and beyond, we envision Jacobs as a company like no other, a company that combines deep domain knowledge of operational environments with the latest advances in technology. We are excited to share a more comprehensive analysis of our strategy at our March investor event.\nNow let's discuss the first quarter results. During the quarter, in People & Places Solutions, our Advanced Facilities business delivered double-digit revenue growth and over 20% growth in operating profit, driven by our work with Intel and other global microchip customers, along with growth in life sciences and the electrical vehicle market. And in the Americas, we're also seeing the beginnings of projects related to the U.S. infrastructure bill enter our pipeline.\nWithin Critical Mission Solutions, we had a highly anticipated significant backlog addition from our space-based intelligence surveillance reconnaissance group called Rapid Solutions. The remainder of CMS pipeline remains strong with substantial new award opportunities expected this fiscal year. PA Consulting continued to outperform, posting another triple-double with 21% revenue growth, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% and double-digit pro forma year-over-year backlog growth.\nTotal Jacobs' net revenue increased 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 11% during the quarter. In the first quarter, we experienced strong bookings. As a result, our overall backlog ended the quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 10% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong backlog growth dynamics of our business, we're reiterating our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook.\nLooking beyond 2022, we expect strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025, excluding any potential deployment of material capital toward M&A opportunities. At our investor event in early March, we'll provide additional detail on how capital deployment and focused new growth opportunities can provide additional upside to this expectation.\nTurning to Slide 5. One of the most attractive opportunities for Jacobs is to expand our data and cyber businesses across 3 focus areas of specialized consulting, operational technology solutions and data analytics platforms. With a combination of strategic acquisition and key talent additions, we have built a strong business providing data and cyber solutions at scale to protect national security. Expanding beyond national security, as attempts by bad actors to cripple both public and commercial assets and facilities continues to increase, we see accelerating requests for our data and cyber solutions from our critical infrastructure customers.\nWe have developed and acquired a portfolio of high-technology solutions such as synthetic aperture radar technology and the BlackLynx edge computing platform, which we plan to further scale and commercialize. Jacobs also has numerous software-based analytics solutions across the water, transportation and environmental verticals, which is now enhanced with the acquisition of StreetLight Data, which I'd now like to discuss in further detail.\nMoving to Slide 6. StreetLight Data is a vertical data-as-a-service analytics platform that helps customers gain insights into 3 high-growth areas. First is understanding mobility and last-mile supply chain analytics of all modes of vehicle and pedestrian movement as well as trip patterns both in recent and comprehensive historical data. Second is analyzing the impact of infrastructure investments, including how to plan the expansion of future communities and where and when to deploy electrical vehicle charging solutions and autonomous vehicles to enhance sustainable solutions. And third is measuring the social value impact of infrastructure investments on underserved communities and populations overall.\nAs the U.S. prepares to embark on one of the largest infrastructure investments in history, having access to these analytics will be crucial, which is a new multibillion-dollar market for Jacobs. We view the addressable market for StreetLight in 3 buckets: expanding market share with North American transportation-focused customer base; leveraging into other infrastructure segments such as water, environmental and the built environment; exploiting adjacent opportunities by expanding internationally and developing large disruptive use cases across multiple areas, leveraging Jacobs' portfolio of data and technology solutions, including geospatial technology and edge computing capabilities from recently acquired BlackLynx to create expanded market penetration, growth opportunities and solutions for our clients.\nThe team at StreetLight has built the industry's leading solution, which is deployed throughout several U.S. and Canadian transportation authorities and municipalities. Specifically, StreetLight is multiple software development cycles ahead of the competition, driven by its unique multimodal data analytics mode, proprietary algorithms and front-end user experience technology. We expect revenue to grow at over a 30% CAGR through 2025.\nA key part of our strategy is investing, aligning and integrating our data and digital capabilities to truly advance our scale and gain the financial economics of a high-margin recurring revenue opportunity that further supports high-value client solutions. This StreetLight acquisition is an important step in this direction. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business.\n\nRobert V. Pragada\n\nPresident & COO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance with total backlog increasing 11% on a pro forma basis to $10.8 billion, driven by strategic new wins in space, cyber and intelligence. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth this year include spaceborne ISR, edge analytics and Intelligent Asset Management.\nBeginning with space ISR. Our military leaders contend that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver our near-peer adversaries across multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly, space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect data much more quickly than airborne ISR, covering 35-fold the number of miles per hour. These small sats with radio frequency synthetic aperture radar provide time-critical intelligence in support of commercial and military missions.\nJacobs continues to develop its advanced payload production and integration capabilities building on technologies from KeyW. With our recent successes, along with the integration of BlackLynx' innovative software platforms, we have unlocked the opportunity to create a potential $0.5 billion annual recurring space ISR business longer term.\nAlso during the quarter, Jacobs won a 36-month contract to provide state-of-the-art digital aerial imagery data that will be used to enhance precision agricultural practices in the midwestern United States. The services will be provided using KeyW technology called GEOPod, which is a scalable, highly agile, airborne imagery system.\nMoving on to edge analytics. Data is often utilized in challenging and unlikely places like the International Space Station, a military satellite, ships at sea, factory floors, water purification plants, traffic lights and neighborhood pharmacies. Data might traditionally reside in a data center or cloud, but many important decisions need to happen on the edge. Jacobs' recent acquisition of BlackLynx, an edge analytics leader in providing the sensors, software and analytic services, allows leaders to speed their decision-making exponentially. As edge computing proliferates across all domains, rapidly gaining actionable insights from the vast data becomes essential. We are already leveraging BlackLynx' edge computing capabilities not only across CMS but also the infrastructure sectors of P&PS in 2022.\nNow in the area of Intelligent Asset Management, we're continuing to build on the solutions we developed with NASA centers and have now deployed at multiple U.S. Navy installations. Typically, these programs range from $250 million to $300 million over 6 to 8 years. We see a growing pipeline of opportunities that span across DoD, the intelligence community and commercial clients. The value for our clients is increased uptime and availability of the facilities at lower total life cycle costs achieved through targeted use of predictive analytics while simultaneously upskilling the workforce at these mission-critical complex installations.\nIn summary, we see solid demand for our solutions in 2022 despite the headwinds of the continuing resolution, which will likely get extended through March. Although we are seeing some funding pushouts impacting our cyber intelligence and defense clients, there are pockets of new funding across our diverse U.S. government customer base as well as in commercial sectors like telecom, where 5G continues to advance. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining at $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile.\nNow on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We started the fiscal year with strong financial performance, resulting in 10% year-over-year backlog growth. I will discuss our results across 4 areas, including climate response, supply chain diversification, infrastructure data solutions and infrastructure modernization.\nStarting with climate response. Opportunities continue to increase related to energy transition. And this has resulted in growth across our end markets and client sectors, notably for grid resiliency, green hydrogen and renewable energy generation. Most recently, Jacobs was selected as a program management partner to Pacific Gas & Electric on their multiyear electric undergrounding program, the largest of its kind in the U.S. The ambitious program will bring 10,000 miles of power lines underground to mitigate wildfires in and near high fire-threat areas to respond to California's evolving climate challenges.\nJacobs will provide a global interdisciplinary team as well as advanced technology approaches that draw on more than 30 years of experience with PG&E and other large complex undergrounding programs like SuedLink in Germany. This important win also leveraged our subject matter experts in PA for yet another synergistic win together. With our recent award at the Pembrook Power Station in the U.K., we are building on our portfolio of industry leadership in the area of hydrogen-based power. And we've been successful with multiple awards related to solar and wind renewable generation projects in Wyoming and Australia.\nMoving to supply chain diversification. As a result of the global supply chain challenge, all sectors in our advanced facilities business are in growth mode, with semiconductors, life sciences and electric vehicles leading the field. And across these sectors, our ability to leverage our global integrated delivery platform and data-centric execution on these complex facilities is a clear market differentiator. Our solutions include significant win with an Asia chip manufacturer, expanding capacity in North America, continued support of intel with additional facilities, including new builds in the U.S. And Jacobs was awarded the delivery of the first data center building for a major colocation client in the southwestern United States.\nIn Health and Life Sciences, we recently won a project with Spark Therapeutics, a Roche Pharmaceuticals company, to build a gene therapy innovation center in downtown Philadelphia to research, develop and manufacture state-of-the-art products. Jacobs continues to deliver sustainable facilities across life sciences, like FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies' new large-scale cell culture facility in North Carolina, the largest of its kind in North America with the goal of 100% clean energy utilization and cutting-edge waste disposal and recycling system. This is a great example of projects that enable us to deliver on our purpose of creating a more connected statable world.\nCritical health care for thriving communities is central to our purpose, and our teams are working with clients to advance outcomes, including design of a mental health facility serving communities in western Sydney, recent completion of a state-of-the-art surgical center in Central Florida and a major hospital redevelopment in Southeast Asia.\nMoving to infrastructure data solutions. Combining our recent digital acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight as well as our venture investment in Microgrid Labs, we are well positioned to provide our clients with technology-enabled solutions through enhanced analytics and insights. We are also ideally positioned to deliver unparalleled value to the transportation and electric vehicle ecosystem, including an innovative in-road charging system in the midwestern United States with Electreon. In the U.K., we are expanding our support of climate risk mitigation and multi-community resiliency for the environment agency through continued innovation of our proven proprietary digital technology, Flood Modeller.\nAdditionally, as part of the first water breakthrough challenge, we provided technical sport to Anglian Water and facilities, which resulted in innovation awards in the area of artificial intelligence for system operation and climate resilient solutions.\nTouching on infrastructure monetization. in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a unique greenfield opportunity where Jacobs is delivering strategic planning and consultancy services to build towards a net zero future. In the U.S., we are supporting clients on major programs and projects to align with capital funding and investment plan. We were selected for these awards based on our industry-leading implementation and long-term delivery success.\nSpecifically, Jacobs was awarded the next phase of a major water treatment facility in North Texas, the new tollway ship channel bridge in Houston, Denver International Airport's seventh runway expansion and a critical win with our long-time customers in New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In summary, our global capability and innovative solutions have continued to differentiate Jacobs and provide confidence in the strength of our business based on early positioning with our clients and longer-term global infrastructure stimulus.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's review our PA Consulting business. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to significantly outperform. Their unique combination of outcome-driven strategic and digital consulting means that they are able to capitalize on the world's current megatrends of agile working, climate change, human health and safety and digital transformation. As an example, their clients' focus on hybrid working is creating new opportunities for PA in organizational agility and resilience offerings in a range of sectors, including financial services and life sciences.\nDigital consulting remains PA's broadest technical capability, supported by increases in the last year in data science, analytics and AI. Aligned with this, PA continues to add to its technology portfolio with offerings such as Oakdoor, a data diode which provides a new level of security for highly-sensitive data even for the most sophisticated segmented networks; iPredict, a groundbreaking AI system for predicting failures in critical electricity distribution which has led to exciting new projects and opportunities for public utility providers in the United States.\nAnd in the health market, PA has partnered with U.S.-based medical device start-up, Fairpack Medical, to create the Casio pump drainage system, a digital handheld single-patient use device to improve patient care and comfort. PA maintains its strong relationship with the U.K. government and has secured 2 new contracts for smart metering and electronic monitoring services. In the private sector, PA successfully completed 2 projects with U.S.-based commercial partners. The first with Raya LLC is to develop a new air distribution platform to overcome material shortages and system installation challenges facing the homebuilding industry. And the second with a food startup to validate and launch an innovative business model to expand market opportunity. PA continues to be an exciting part of Jacobs' portfolio and is a crucial part of our new strategy as we continue to grow in the consulting and advisory space. Over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin C. Berryman\n\nPresident & CFO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Now turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of first quarter fiscal 2022 results. Gross revenue was flat year-over-year, driven by a decrease in pass-through revenue with net revenue up 6% and down 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Pro forma net revenue growth was impacted by the timing of large CMS wins and P&PS Americas customers evaluating investments from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill. I'll explain these dynamics a bit further during the review of the lines of business performance.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.4%, up 430 basis points. Consistent with the last few quarters, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both P&PS, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin to the total Jacobs' portfolio. We expect gross margin as a percentage of net revenue to remain in the 26% to 27% range for the remainder of fiscal 2022. As we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix, longer term, our gross margins will expand.\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, we saw an increase in medical costs higher than our expectations, indicating some pent-up demand for medical care near the end of the annual plan period, which ends on December 31. GAAP operating profit was $177 million and was mainly impacted by a $72 million largely noncash charge associated with a strategic reduction in our real estate footprint as well as $47 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. The real estate downsize is the result of our ability to further leverage technology as we adapt to our new strategic ways of working. We are finding that our teams enjoy this flexibility, and we continue to see productivity increases in this regard.\nAdjusted operating profit was $308 million, up 19%, driven by PA posting strong double-digit growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year-ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was nearly 11%, up 110 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $1.03 per share and included: a $0.41 charge related to the previously mentioned downsizing of our real estate footprint; a $0.23 charge related to our amortization of acquired intangibles; $0.05 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower; and a positive $0.16 tax benefit in the quarter, effectively lowering our expected adjusted tax rate for the year to approximately 22%. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.56.\nDuring the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. Jacobs' consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 11% year-over-year and represented 11% of net revenue.\nFinally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. We posted a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x for Q1, driven by strength in both lines of business. The strong booking performance positions us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the remainder of fiscal year 2022.\nRegarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q1 2022 revenue was down 10% year-over-year and 12% on a pro forma basis. CMS revenue growth continued to be impacted by the contract runoff of a large, low-margin procurement contract and timing related to our transition on another large DOE contract. The combined year-over-year impact of the 2 contracts was approximately $220 million. When excluding the contract runoff, pro forma CMS revenue growth was up 5%, indicating a strong underlying positive growth profile. As a result, we expect CMS Q2 revenue to show solid growth, with second half 2022 revenue growth accelerating further as recent new wins and backlog begin to burn.\nFor the full fiscal year, we expect reported revenue growth to be above 5%. While portions of our CMS portfolio are seeing some headwinds associated with unresolved continuing resolution in Washington, the diversity and strength of our balanced portfolio will more than offset that and drive solid organic growth.\nCMS Q1 operating profit was $111 million, up 1%. Operating profit margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 9.6%. The improvement for the quarter in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business as well as the timing related to transition of our large DOE contracts. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the 8% to 9% range through the balance of fiscal 2022 but improve longer term as our revenue mix from higher-margin wins improves.\nMoving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Our Advanced Facilities business net revenue growth was up double digits year-over-year, driven by the investments in the semiconductor supply chain. We expect Advanced Facilities to further accelerate its growth throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong double-digit year-over-year growth, driven by more steady government funding and a favorable first quarter of fiscal 2021 year-over-year compare. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we expect solid mid-single-digit net revenue growth for our international business.\nMoving to P&PS Americas. Current revenues remained soft due to the delayed approval of the infrastructure bill. However, we are beginning to see some projects related to the infrastructure bill enter into our pipeline. Our first quarter bookings and rising backlog provide us confidence that the Americas business will show a sequential growth as we work through the balance of our fiscal year 2022.\nP&PS Q1 operating profit was down 2% year-over-year with a 13.2% operating profit margin, driven by increased G&A expenses as we remain committed to strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $290 million in revenue and $63 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in both U.S. dollars and pound sterling. Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22%.\nOn the next slide, I will provide an additional overview of PA's financial profile. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $58 million, up year-over-year and slightly higher than our expectations, driven primarily by the increases in medical costs. We still expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022.\nMoving to Slide 12. We are approaching a year since we closed the 65% investment in PA Consulting, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. PA Consulting provides a unique combination of high-value strategic and digital consulting services to a diverse group of public and private clients. The exposure to these high-growth sectors is reflected in the company's ability to compound high double-digit revenue growth while maintaining operating profit margins well above 20%. Interestingly, U.S. publicly traded consultancies that have this type of financial profile are valued at more than 20x adjusted EBITDA, indicating that PA's performance profile offers upside to Jacobs' current valuation. At our upcoming investor event, we will provide further insight into PA's growth strategy.\nTurning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another outstanding quarter of cash flow generation with $302 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement, down 8 days year-over-year. And the quarter's cash flow included a $55 million cash payment for COVID-related deferred FICA tax payments. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be impacted by PA's cash payments associated with their year-end performance, higher cash taxes and an uptick in our DSO figures, given some discrete items that favorably impacted our Q1 results.\nGiven our strong Q1 free cash flow performance and structural improvements in our collection processes through our Focus 2023 initiatives, we see increased conviction of achieving our 1x free cash flow conversion target. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, and we recently announced an increase of 10% to $0.23 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Demetriou\n\nChairman & CEO, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world has never been more relevant to now as advances in data analytics and edge computing power are unlocking our ability to deploy innovative technologies related to climate change, infrastructure and national security. Our proactive portfolio management to align ourselves to these long-term secular growth opportunities has provided us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios and even during the pandemic.\nWe are now entering a stage where we are experiencing growth across all of Jacobs, and we expect accelerating top line growth throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion and our adjusted EPS outlook of $6.85 to $7.45.\nBeyond the current fiscal year, our sales pipeline and robust end markets indicate continued strong performance. As I stated earlier, we anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS at fiscal 2025, with the potential for upside driven by deploying additional investment in our growth accelerators of climate response, data and high-value consultancy. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions."

Speaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. I apologize in advance for my voice. I'm fighting through a little cold here, but I'm sure we'll get through it okay.\nYesterday afternoon, we were pleased to report our third quarter results. The hard work of our nearly 28,000 employees enabled record revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The year is playing out better than we originally expected our updated guidance reflects the demand environment we continue to successfully serve. In short, our unique value proposition, experience, and ability to support a broad range of our customers' needs distinguishes us from the competition.\nLast quarter, I spent a lot of time on the road visiting branches, job sites and meeting with customers. And while this is nothing new. It did make the quarter's results and our subsequent guidance update, no surprise from my perspective. Our branches are very busy, and the team is working hard to serve customer demand. Our people are true differentiators in the rental industry and their professionalism and knowledge, their expertise and their commitment day in and day out shows. We often talk about putting the customer at the center of everything we do as it feeds our flywheel of growth. Without the dedicated United Rentals team members safely executing our customer-centric model, we could not generate the success we continue to deliver. And from where I sit today, I expect this momentum to carry into 2026.\nIn the third quarter specifically, we again saw growth across both our general rental and specialty businesses with optimism from the field and our customer confidence index, reinforcing our expectations going forward. The demand for used equipment also remains healthy. Now with that said, let me get into the review of our third quarter results and our updated 2025 guidance. And then Ted will review the financials in detail before we open the line for Q&A.\nLet's start with the quarter's results. Our total revenue grew by 5.9% year-over-year to $4.2 billion. And within this, rental revenue grew by 5.8% to $3.7 billion, both third quarter records. Fleet productivity increased 2%, contributing to OER growth of 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a third quarter record of over $1.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 46%. And finally, adjusted EPS came in at $11.70.\nNow turning to customer activity. And as I mentioned, we saw growth across both our GenRent and specialty businesses in the quarter. Specialty continues to post double-digit increases with rental revenue up 11% year-over-year driven by growth across all our product offerings and an additional 18 cold starts. Year-to-date, we've opened 47 cold starts as we continue to fill out our specialty footprint. We see this combined with the power of cross-sell and the addition of new products to our portfolio as critical points of competitive differentiation, which benefit our customers while also providing important drivers of long-term growth.\nBy vertical, our construction end markets saw strong growth across both infrastructure and nonresidential construction, while our industrial end markets saw particular strength within power. We continue to see new projects kicking off. And while data centers are certainly 1 area of growth, we also saw new projects across infrastructure, semis, hospitals, LNG facilities and airports to name just a few. Our end market exposure by vertical is intentionally diversified and our equipment is fungible to ensure we can serve demand no matter where it presents itself.\nNow turning to the used market. We sold $619 million of OEC at a recovery rate of 54%. The demand for used equipment is healthy, and we're on track to sell approximately $2.8 billion of fleet this year. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the year is playing out better than we initially expected. To meet this demand, we spent nearly $1.5 billion of CapEx in the quarter and now expect to spend over $4 billion on fleet this year. This positions us not only to capitalize on the current environment, but also for the anticipated growth in 2026. Our customers and the field remain optimistic, particularly around large projects and key verticals.\nAnd thanks to our go-to-market approach and one-stop shop value proposition, we believe we're well positioned to be the partner of choice for these projects. Year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion, with the expectation to generate between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the full year, including the impact of our higher CapEx spend. As a reminder, the combination of our industry-leading profitability capital efficiency and the flexibility of our business model enables us to generate meaningful free cash flow throughout the cycle and in turn, allocate that capital in ways that allow us to create long-term shareholder value.\nSpeaking of capital allocation, we always start with ensuring the balance sheet is in a good place, and it is. We then fund organic growth reflected through our CapEx and complement this with inorganic growth that makes financial and strategic sense. In the remainder, we returned to shareholders. This quarter specifically, we returned over $730 million to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and our dividend. For the full year, we remain on track to return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders.\nOur leverage of less than 1.9x leaves plenty of dry powder to support disciplined M&A, where we continue to pursue opportunities to put capital to work and attractive returns. Our M&A pipeline remains robust within both GenRent and specialty and across the spectrum of deal sizes. And while it's difficult to predict the timing of M&A, this is an important capability we've built over our company's history. And we'll continue to use it to enhance our business and drive shareholder value.\nAs we enter the final months of 2025, we're focused on execution, and delivering the results outlined in our updated guidance, including total revenue growth of 5% or 6% ex use, strong profitability, robust free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital. Although our growth is coming with some additional costs, which Ted will cover in his remarks, we're working through these challenges and are taking proactive measures, including bringing in additional fleet to help mitigate fleet movement costs. I'm very pleased with 2025 and how it's playing out ahead of our initial expectations and see good momentum heading into next year. Based on what we see today, 2026 will be another year of healthy growth. We believe the tailwinds we've discussed throughout this year will carry over and our unrelenting focus on being the partner of choice for our customers, positions us very well to win this business and to outperform the industry.\nFor now, we won't get into the specifics about '26 as we're in the middle of our planning process, but we will share more details in January as we always do. In closing, I'm pleased with the outstanding job the United Rentals team is doing to support our customers. And that's the starting point for everything we do. Not only do we have the scale, technology and value proposition to make us the preferred partner, but we have a history of execution our customers can rely on. By working together with our customers to meet their goals to drive safety, productivity and efficiency, we ensure we build a relationship with trust that positions us to win in the marketplace. Subsequently, our strategy, business model, competitive advantages and capital discipline allow us to generate compelling shareholder returns for the long term.\nSo with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Ted, and then we'll take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, the year continues to progress well with third quarter records across total revenue, rental revenue and EBITDA. More importantly, based both on what we're seeing and hearing from customers, we expect the strong demand to continue, which is supporting our increases in both rental revenue and CapEx guidance. More on that in a minute, but first, let's go through this quarter's numbers.\nAs you saw in our press release, rental revenue increased $202 million year-over-year or 5.8% to a third quarter record of $3.67 billion supported again by growth from large projects and key verticals. Within this, OER increased by $133 million or 4.7% and driven by 4.2% growth in our average fleet size and fleet productivity of 2%, partially offset by some fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental, ancillary and re-rent grew over 10%, adding a combined $69 million of revenue. Consistent with our first half results, third quarter ancillary growth again outpaced OER as we continue to focus on supporting our customers.\nMoving to use, we generated $333 million of proceeds at an adjusted margin of 45.9% and a 54% recovery rate while OEC sold set a third quarter record at $619 million. Combined, these results speak to the continued strength and health of the used equipment market.\nTurning to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $42 million year-on-year to an all-time record of $1.95 billion. Within this, a $69 million increase in rental gross profits was partially offset by a $6 million decline in used gross profit dollars. SG&A increased $23 million, which is in line with revenue growth, while other non-rental lines of businesses added $2 million.\nLooking at profitability. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.0% implying 170 basis points of compression on an as-reported basis and 150 basis points ex use. At a high level, margin dynamics in the third quarter were similar to what we've discussed the last several quarters. This includes the impact of ancillary, the strategic investments we're making in the business and still relatively elevated inflation. An area I might call out again this quarter was delivery, which was impacted both by higher fleet repositioning costs in support of large projects and our use of third-party outside haul to serve the stronger-than-expected demand seen during our seasonal peak.\nTo try to put this in perspective, our third quarter delivery costs increased 20% year-on-year versus a roughly 6% increase in rental revenue. Simply assuming that these costs increase proportional to revenue. This gap implies over $30 million of additional cost year-on-year and translates to an almost 80 basis points drag in our EBITDA margins. Now I'm sure we'll talk more about this during Q&A. But this provides a great example of the balance we are constantly managing between capital in the form of fleet and costs, both fixed and variable with the goal of serving customers as efficiently as possible.\nShifting to CapEx. Third quarter gross rental CapEx was $1.49 billion. I'll speak more to this in a moment, but this included the acceleration of some purchases to help us support the stronger-than-expected demand we are experiencing. Moving to returns and free cash flow. Our return on invested capital of 12% remains comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital, while year-to-date free cash flow was $1.19 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with net leverage of 1.86x at the end of September and total liquidity of over $2.45 billion.\nAll note, this was after returning $1.63 billion to shareholders year-to-date including $350 million via dividends and $1.28 billion through repurchases. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we still plan to return almost $2.4 billion in cash to our shareholders this year. This equates to a little better than $37 per share or a return of capital yield of almost 4%.\nNow let's shift to the updated guidance we shared last night, which reflects our confidence in delivering another year of solid results. As you've heard us say a few times this morning, we are seeing stronger-than-expected demand. In response, we accelerated the landing of some fleet into Q3 while also raising our full year CapEx guidance by $300 million at midpoint to a range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion.\nIn turn, we are increasing our total revenue guidance by $150 million at midpoint, while narrowing the range to $16 billion to $16.2 billion, implying full year growth of roughly 5% at midpoint. Within this, our used sales guidance is unchanged at around $1.45 billion, which implies total revenue growth ex use of 6% at midpoint. I'll note that the additional CapEx accounts for roughly half of the increase to our revenue guidance, given we'll only realize a partial year of OER benefit with the balance coming from ancillary. On the EBITDA side, we are narrowing our range to $7.325 billion to $7.425 billion while maintaining the midpoint of $7.37 billion.\nAhead of Q&A, I'll quickly mention that the lack of implied pull-through from this additional revenue reflects our expectation that, as I just mentioned, a portion of the increase will come from lower-margin ancillary while we also expect to manage through similar cost dynamics in Q4 and especially delivery.\nTurning to cash flow. We reaffirm the midpoint of our guidance for cash flow from operations at $5.2 billion, while our revised free cash flow guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion simply reflects the additional investment in CapEx that we plan to make. Importantly, our updated free cash flow guidance does not impact our share repurchase program. I'll remind you that we intend to repurchase $1.9 billion of shares this year, which highlights our strategy of both investing in growth and returning access capital to our shareholders.\nSo to wrap up my prepared remarks, overall, we were pleased with how the quarter played out, especially on the demand side. And while our margins were burdened by the cost mentioned, we remain focused on supporting our customers' growth as efficiently as possible as we lean into their demand.\nSo with that said, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Yesterday afternoon, we were pleased to report solid second quarter results, which reflected a continuation of the momentum we reported last quarter. More importantly, our updated guidance speaks to the confidence both we and our customers have in the remainder of the year.\nCritical to the success is our team of over 27,000 individuals who focus on being the partner of choice for our customers and live our one UR culture every day. This includes putting safety at the forefront of everything we do to enable us to deliver a superior value proposition and ultimately, the results our shareholders have come to expect.\nIn the second quarter specifically, we again saw growth across both our industrial and construction end markets. Healthy demand for used equipment and ongoing optimism from the field, which is reinforced by our Customer Confidence Index.\nSo having said all this, today, I'll review our second quarter results and touch on our updated 2025 guidance. Then I'll discuss the recent win, which illustrates our strategy in the utility vertical, followed by a look into how our best-in-class telematics is helping our customers improve their own productivity. Afterwards, Ted will review the financials in detail before we open up the call to Q&A. So with that, let's start with the second quarter results.\nOur total rental revenue grew by 4.5% year-over-year to $3.9 billion. And within this, rental revenue grew by 6.2% to $3.4 billion, both second quarter records. Fleet productivity increased by 3.3%, supported by disciplined execution. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a second quarter record of $1.8 billion, translating to a margin of nearly 46%. And finally, adjusted EPS came in at $10.47.\nNow let's turn to customer activity. We continue to see growth in both our GenRent and Specialty businesses. Specialty rental revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while opening 21 cold starts in the second quarter. We remain on track to open at least 50 this year. By vertical, our construction end markets saw impressive growth across both infrastructure and nonresidential construction, while our industrial end markets saw particular strength within power, metals and minerals and chemical processes. We continue to see new projects kicking off with a few recent examples, including data centers, hospitals and airports.\nNow turning to the used market. We sold $600 million of OEC, in line with our expectations. The demand for used equipment remains healthy, and we're on track to sell approximately $2.8 billion of fleet this year. In response to the continued customer demand I discussed earlier, we spent nearly $1.6 billion on rental CapEx in the quarter, also in line with our expectations. Specialty and large projects continue to fuel growth. And we feel that we are well positioned to serve these based on our go-to-market approach and our one-stop-shop value proposition. Subsequently, year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion, with the expectation to now generate between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year, which includes the benefit from the recent changes in federal tax policy.\nOur ability to generate free cash flow remains a distinguishing feature of the company. As you've heard me say repeatedly, the combination of our industry-leading profitability, capital efficiency and the flexibility of our business model enables us to generate meaningful free cash flow throughout the cycle and in turn, allocate that capital in ways that allow us to create long-term shareholder value.\nIn regards to capital allocation, our balance sheet is in excellent shape. This quarter, after funding organic growth, we returned $534 million to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and/or dividend. And for the full year, we now expect to return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders, and Ted will get into more details in a bit. Our leverage of 1.8x remains towards the lower end of our targeted range, leaving plenty of dry powder to support growth and return excess capital to our shareholders. And M&A remains a core element of our strategy with the team focused on finding opportunities to put capital to work at attractive returns.\nNow let's turn to the rest of 2025. As evidenced by our updated guidance, our expectations for the year at the midpoint are total revenue growth of 4% or 5% ex used, with EBITDA margins north of 46%. Our CapEx expectations are unchanged, while we do expect higher free cash flow, as I discussed earlier.\nLooking beyond 2025, we continue to focus on driving profitable growth. Key to this is partnering with our customers so we're able to meet their demands and improve their own productivity. Through our one-stop-shop offering supported by unmatched technological capabilities, we're able to serve our customers and drive repeat bases. The rental business is very much based on trust, and we're diligent in our approach to building this by delivering on our commitments.\nOur value proposition to the customer goes beyond just equipment. We have a large and reliable fleet, enabled with technology to further customer productivity, all of which is supported by the best team in the industry. One of the vertical strategies we focus on since 2016 is utilities. The acquisition of [indiscernible] last year was the perfect opportunity to marry this strategy with an additional product. Case in point, the utility vertical is now north of 10% of our revenue versus 4% fewer than 10 years ago. Just recently, a large utility customer awarded us a 5-year agreement because we took the time to work with operators across their business, functioning like we were part of their company. We offered a wide range of solutions the customer needed, and through the power of cross-sell now rent then products across every specialty business we have. Furthermore, they're now asking how else can we partner together, which is exactly where you want to be as a value-added service provider.\nOn the technology front, this year, we continue to enhance our advanced telematics offering, which helps customers operate even more efficiently. By utilizing the unique functionality of our telematics and total control software, customers can realize meaningful savings across all their fleet needs. With complete visibility to their rental fleet and aggregated information across multiple projects, optimizing consumption and productivity becomes a reality. Our capabilities also help customers reduce unauthorized equipment use and subsequent fuel consumption and overage fees. Instances such as these, where we help boost productivity and budget efficiency, make us a better partner to our customers and enable repeat business. And while these are just a few examples of the things we're doing to be the partners of choice for our customers, I think they provide concrete examples of how our strategy is allowing us to win.\nIn closing, the year continues to play out as expected, with our team doing an outstanding job supporting customers to drive profitable growth. Our business model, strategy, competitive advantages and capital discipline will allow us to generate compelling returns for shareholders in the long term.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted, and then we'll take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Mat Matt shared, 2025 continues to progress as expected, with second quarter records across total revenue, rental revenue and EBITDA. Looking ahead, our updated guidance reflects the demand we see across our end markets supported by our differentiated strategy and strong execution. So with that said, let's jump into the numbers.\nRental revenue increased $200 million year-over-year or 6.2% to a second quarter record of over $3.4 billion, supported again by growth from large projects and key verticals. Within this, OER increased by $141 million or 5.4%, driven by 3.6% growth in our average fleet size and fleet productivity of 3.3%, partially offset by assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%.\nAlso within rental, ancillary and re-rent grew by roughly 10% year-on-year, adding a combined $59 million of revenue. Similar to Q1, ancillary growth continues to outpace OER by a healthy margin, driven largely by Specialty, where value-added services are a key element of our strategy to be the partner of choice for our customers.\nTurning to our used results. We generated $317 million of proceeds at an adjusted margin of 48.3% and a 53% recovery rate, both of which reflect sequential improvements. Underpinning these results, we sold $600 million of OEC in the quarter, which is essentially flat year-on-year.\nMoving to EBITDA. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was a second quarter record at $1.81 billion, translating to an increase of $41 million. Within this, rental gross profit contributed $86 million. This was partially offset by used where the normalization of the used market drove the majority of the $36 million decline in used gross profit dollars. SG&A increased $18 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales at 10.7%. And finally, the EBITDA contribution from other non-rental lines of businesses increased $9 million.\nLooking at profitability. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.9%, implying 100 basis points of compression, including the impact of normalizing these margins. Excluding the impact of used, our second quarter margin compression was a bit better at 70 basis points. With the usual caveat that year-over-year quarterly comparisons are always going to be subject to normal variability. In general, we continue to see the same margin dynamics that we discussed in April. The biggest of these includes the relative outgrowth of lower-margin ancillary revenue versus core rental growth, which obviously has a dilutive impact on our rental margins, as we've discussed the last several quarters.\nOur second quarter profitability was also impacted by higher delivery costs, driven largely by strong growth in our matting business and the ongoing fleet repositioning tied to the increased dispersion of growth across our footprint.\nFinally, and more generally, it remains a relatively inflationary environment, while we continue to make important investments in areas like specialty cold starts and technology. And while these decisions do drag on margins, we view them as smart choices that both support future growth and provide attractive returns. The last thing I'll mention on the P&L side of things is our adjusted earnings per share of $10.47.\nShifting to CapEx. Second quarter gross rental CapEx was $1.57 billion, consistent with normal seasonality.\nMoving to returns on free cash flow, our return on invested capital of 12.4% remained well above our weighted average cost of capital, while year-to-date free cash flow of $1.2 billion keeps us on track to hit our full year target.\nOur balance sheet remains very strong with net leverage of 1.8x at the end of June, and total liquidity of $3 billion. I'll note, this was after returning $902 million to shareholders year-to-date, including $235 million via dividends and $667 million through share repurchases.\nAs you saw in our press release, supported by the strength of our underlying business and the benefits from recent tax reform, we have increased our planned share repurchases for the year by $400 million to $1.9 billion. This represents roughly 3.8% of our current market capitalization. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we now intend to return almost $2.4 billion in cash to shareholders in 2025, equating to close to $37 per share or a return of capital yield of about 4.7%.\nNow let's shift to the updated guidance we shared last night, which reflects our confidence in delivering another year of solid results. As previously mentioned, we are raising the midpoint of guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow while narrowing the ranges for both revenue and EBITDA as we normally do at this point of the year.\nIn terms of specifics, for total revenue, we're increasing the midpoint by $100 million while narrowing the range to $15.8 billion to $16.1 billion, implying full year growth of roughly 4% at midpoint. Within this, I'll note that our used sales guidance is unchanged at $1.45 billion on approximately $2.8 billion of OEC sold, implying total revenue growth ex use of about 5%. Importantly, the increase in total revenue guidance is primarily due to stronger growth from lower-margin ancillary with our underlying expectations largely unchanged as the years continue to play out as expected.\nOn adjusted EBITDA, we increased the midpoint by $50 million while narrowing the range to $7.3 billion to $7.45 billion. Notably, this primarily reflects the net impact of the H&E termination benefit. As was the case of revenue, our underlying expectation for EBITDA is largely unchanged as again, the year has continued to play out as expected.\nOn the CapEx side, no changes with the year still expected in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion. And finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance by $400 million to $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion translating to a free cash flow margin of 15.7% at the midpoint of updated guidance. The increase in free cash flow primarily reflects the benefits of recently enacted tax reform, which reinstated full expensing of CapEx and thus, will reduce our cash taxes. As was the case with both revenue and EBITDA, our core expectations for free cash flow are largely unchanged.\nSo to wrap up my prepared remarks, overall, another solid quarter with, and I promise this is the last time I'll say it before Q&A, the year playing out in line with our expectations. So with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

Thanks to the team's steadfast commitment to this, which always includes putting safety first, we delivered first quarter records across revenue and adjusted EBITDA.\nThis is facilitated by operational excellence and innovation. And as you saw through our reaffirmed guidance, 2025 is on track to be another year of profitable growth, reinforced by the momentum we've carried into our busy season.\nToday, I'll review our first quarter results. followed by why we feel confident in our 2025 guidance. And finally, I'll discuss how we think this is for the long-term success. And then Ted will discuss financials in detail before we open up the call to Q&A. So with that, let's start with the first quarter results.\nOur total revenue grew by 6.7% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. And within this, Rental revenue grew by 7.4% to $3.1 billion, both first quarter records. Fleet productivity increased to 3.1% as reported and 1.9% pro forma for Yak, which we've now lapped increased to a first quarter record of $1 million, translating to a margin of nearly 45%. And finally, adjusted EPS came in at $8.86. Customer activity. We continue to see growth in both our Gen Rent and Specialty businesses. In fact, specialty rental revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 15% pro forma for Yak.\nWe opened 8 specialty cold starts in the first quarter and expect to open at least 50 this year. By vertical, our construction end markets saw solid growth across both infrastructure and nonres while our industrial end markets saw particular strength within power and chemical process. We continue to see new projects kicking off with a few recent examples, including data centers, pharmaceuticals, airports and industrial manufacturing facilities.\nNow turning to the used market. We sold over $740 million of OEC, which was a first quarter record. The demand for used equipment remains healthy, and we're on track to sell an estimated $2.8 billion of fleet this year. We spent over $700 million on rental CapEx in the quarter in response to solid customer demand. As you'd expect, it continues to be led by large projects where all elements of our strategy position us to be the partner of choice. Free cash flow of nearly $1.1 billion, setting us up for another year of strong cash generation, which we view as a hallmark of the company.\nThe combination of our industry-leading profitability, capital efficiency and the flexibility of our business model enables us to generate meaningful free cash flow throughout the cycle and in turn, allocate that capital in ways that allow us to create long-term shareholder value.\nFinally, capital allocation. Priority #1 for us is funding growth while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. After the organic growth we supported in the quarter, we returned nearly $370 million to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and our dividend. Our leverage of 1.7x remains towards the lower end of our targeted range. leaving plenty of dry powder to support both inorganic growth and to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAnd to this point, following the completion of our prior share repurchase authorization last month, I'm pleased to share that our Board has approved a new $1.5 billion program, as Ted will discuss shortly.\nNow let's turn to the rest of 2025. As evidenced by our reiterated guidance, our expectations for the year are unchanged. The year is off to a start we anticipated, while feedback from the field continues to be optimistic, particularly for large projects. The momentum we're carrying into our busy season, along with backlogs and our customer confidence index are all supportive of our outlook.\nI'll note, we've not seen a change in customer outlooks for the balance of 2025. But with all that said, we understand the recent concerns around the macro uncertainty. And if things change, we feel confident in our ability to react to best support both our customers and our stakeholders. And as we think about the long term, our strategy is built on how we can competitively differentiate ourselves and outpace the market.\nWhen we listen to the voice of the customer, we gain additional conviction that our one-stop shop offering is critically important. The power of cross-selling lets us take our long-established relationships and accelerate our growth by meeting our customer demands with both our Gen Rent and specialty products. And when we layer on our technology offerings, we're able to provide our customers a truly unique experience. And while we've had specialty as part of our business mix for many years, we believe this growth engine has a lot of runway ahead, supported by the graphic white space and additional products that we can add to our portfolio to continue to better serve our customers.\nTo bring this to light, we have a large national account customer with a long-standing relationship, primarily with our Gen Rent team. And as we dug into how we could better serve the customers' needs, we learned we had the opportunity to be a better partner. This included not just providing additional products, but also innovating together, such as feeding information directly into their own internal tracking systems, ship.\nWe learned more about the customers' requirements and added specialty products to fit the bill. Well, to make a long over just 2 years, we've increased their spend with us by 12 times. By becoming an enterprise solution, specialty has increased from 10% of their spend with us to 40%. And this example is another strong go-to-market strategy.\nIn closing, we remain focused on being the best partner to our customers. We're on track for another year of profitable growth, and we believe the longer-term outlook we see, combined with our business model, strategy, capital discipline and our competitive advantages will allow us to generate compelling shareholder returns.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted, and then we'll take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. As Matt just shared, 2025 is off to first quarter records across total revenue, rental revenue and EBITDA, which combined with the momentum of the season and encouraging customer sentiment is enabling us to reaffirm our full year guidance. So with that said, let's jump into the numbers. First quarter rental revenue was a record at $1 billion. That's a year-on-year increase of $216 million or 7.4%, supported again by growth from large projects and key verticals.\nWithin this, OER increased by $118 million or 4.9%, driven by 3.3% growth in our average fleet size and fleet productivity of 3.1%, assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental, ancillary and re-rent grew by guiding a combined $98 million of revenue. This outsized growth relative to OER was primarily driven by specialty where delivery representation of revenue from our Matting business and where our other specialty businesses support contented services like fueling and installation as part of our one-stop shop strategy.\nTurning to our used results. As Matt mentioned, we took advantage of strong demand to sell a first quarter record amount of OEC generating $377 million of proceeds at an adjusted margin of 47.2% and a 51% recovery rate. Moving to EBITDA. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was a first quarter record of $1.67 billion. translating to an increase of $84 million or 5%.\nWithin this, rental gross profit contributed $89 million. This was partially offset by used where the continuing normalization of the market drove a 13% decline in used gross profit dollars translating to a $26 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. SG&A increased by $47 million, including $12 million of H&E related merger costs.\nExcluding these costs, our growth in SG&A was roughly in line with growth in rental revenue. And finally, the EBITDA contribution from other non-rental lines of businesses increased $68 million primarily due to the $64 million breakup fee we received from the termination of the H&E deal.\nLooking at profitability. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.9%, implying 60 basis points of compression. Notably, and as our press release highlighted, this includes a $52 million net benefit related to the breakup fee, which is the $64 million less the $12 million of related SG&A costs. Although it doesn't impact EBITDA, we also absorbed roughly $13 million of bridge financing fees related to the deal that are included in expense. Taken together, our first quarter results included a net pretax benefit of others. The margins, excluding the H&E benefit and the impact of used sales, our EBITDA margin compressed 150 basis points year-over-year.\nSimilar to last quarter, I thought it would be helpful to talk through a few of the key factors here ahead of Q&A. Now of course, margins in any given quarter will fluctuate with normal variability. But at a high level, the dynamics in Q1 were consistent with what we talked about in January. First, Ancillary revenue again significantly outpaced our core rental growth. The core elements of our service offering, particularly within specialty that come at a lower margin than our core rental business, but have attractive returns as they don't employ much capital. As importantly, they provide a unique aspect to customer service that both differentiates United Rentals and helps drive deeper customer engagement.\nSo from this perspective, we view this as good business, but it does have a dilutive impact on margins that we'd estimate at about 50 basis points in Q1 or about 1/3 of the 150 basis point decline. Secondly, first quarter delivery costs were up, driven by a few dynamics, including our growth in matting and the increased dispersion of growth across our footprint. A byproduct of the latter is the greater need to reposition fleet in support of high time utilization. Said differently, these are choices we make between costs and capital efficiency with the idea of supporting returns.\nFor the quarter, these additional repositioning or margin by about 30 basis points. And finally, given where we sit in the current cycle, our OER growth remains relatively low in a still fairly inflationary environment. At the same time, we continue to make long-term strategic investments in important areas like specialty cold starts and technology, both of which enable to be the partner of choice to customers and provide attractive returns.\nThe combination of these factors and normal variability in our costs accounted for the balance of the decline, so call it about 70 basis points. Importantly, these are all contemplated within the ranges provided in our guidance.\nAnd lastly, on the P&L side of things, our adjusted earnings per share was $8.86, including a $0.45 benefit from H&E. Shifting to CapEx. First quarter gross rental CapEx was $707 million, in line with normal seasonality. Moving to returns and free cash flow. Our return on invested capital of 12.6% remained well above our weighted average cost of capital, while free cash flow totaled a robust $1.08 billion, is quite strong with net leverage of 1.7x a quarter and over $3.3 billion.\nI'll note, this was after returning $368 million to shareholders in the first quarter, including $118 million via dividend and $250 million via repurchases. Looking forward, following the completion of our repurchase program last month, we are pleased to share that our Board approved a new $1.5 billion supported by our continued strong free cash flow generation on the balance sheet.\nThe new program will begin this quarter and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2026. For the year, it is our intent to repurchase a total of $1.5 billion of common stock, including the shares we repurchased in the first quarter. At our current share price, this represents about 4% of our market capitalization. In total, we intend to return roughly $2 billion in cash to shareholders in 2025 equating to over $30 per share or a return of capital yield of better than 5%.\nSo to wrap up my prepared remarks, overall, another solid quarter that puts us in a position to reaffirm guidance on total revenue, EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow. The balance sheet remains in great shape, providing strong optionality for the business while our commitment to capital discipline keeps us positioned to support long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.\nBefore we begin, please note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the safe harbor statement contained in the company's press release.\nFor a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.unitedrentals.com. Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.\nYou should also note that the company's press release and today's call include references to non-GAAP terms such as free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the back of the company's recent investor presentations to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSpeaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. We are pleased to report our solid fourth quarter results yesterday as the year culminated with record revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We again saw growth across our construction and industrial end markets as well as continued strong demand for used equipment. Our team doubled down on being the best partner of choice for our customers. Our diligence on safety, coupled with unmatched service, technology and operational excellence translated into the results we reported. Importantly, all of this sets the foundation for our future growth.\nToday, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, followed by our expectations for 2025 and finally, recap why we are excited about the H&E acquisition we announced a few weeks ago. Then Ted will discuss the financials in detail before we open up the call for Q&A, which we will keep focused on United Rentals as a stand-alone company. Our plan remains to update the investment community on the combined companies after the transaction closes, which is still expected by the end of our first quarter.\nSo with that, let's start with the fourth quarter results. Our total revenue grew 9.8% year-over-year to almost $4.1 billion. And within this, rental revenue grew by 9.7% to $3.4 billion, both fourth quarter records. Fleet productivity increased by 4.3% as reported and 2% ex Yak. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a fourth quarter record of $1.9 billion, translating to a margin of over 46%. And finally, adjusted EPS grew year-over-year to $11.59, another fourth quarter record.\nNow let's turn to customer activity. We saw growth in both our GenRent and Specialty businesses. Specialty rental revenue impressively grew more than [indiscernible] percent. These results were driven by rental revenue across all businesses with a combination of solid same-store sales growth and an additional 15 cold starts putting us at 72% for the full year. And as a reminder, these Specialty cold starts are a key element to accelerating our growth in this high-return segment.\nBy vertical, we continue to see similar trends to the rest of last year with nonresidential growth helping to fuel construction and industrial growth driven by manufacturing and power. And we saw new projects across data centers, chip manufacturing, sports stadiums and power to name a few.\nNow turning to the used market, which continues to exhibit strong demand. We sold over $850 million of OEC in the quarter, which was a record for any quarter in our history. The depth and health of demand in the used market is allowing us to rotate our existing fleet to ensure we can serve our customers' needs efficiently. This is evident through our full year CapEx of over $3.7 billion. And as a result, we drove free cash flow of nearly $2.1 billion, which translated to a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 13%.\nThe combination of our industry-leading profitability, capital efficiency and the flexibility of our business model enables us to generate meaningful free cash flow throughout the cycle and in turn, create long-term shareholder value. To that end, we returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders last year through a combination of share buybacks and our dividend. And while we paused our share repurchase plan ahead of the H&E closing, I'm pleased to announce we'll be raising our quarterly dividend by 10% year-over-year to $1.79 per share.\nNow let's turn to 2025, which we expect to be another year of growth, again, led by large project growth. Customer optimism, backlogs and feedback from our field team, combined with the demand we're carrying into the new year, all support our guidance. This was reinforced at our annual management meeting, which we held earlier this month in Houston, Texas. Where we discussed how a key element of our culture is the quality of people who work for United Rentals. And this was on full display in Houston, as over 2,600 team members came together to focus and engage on being the partners of choice for our customers through our differentiated value proposition.\nFinally, I'd like to reiterate what I said 2 weeks ago when we announced our intent to acquire H&E. We're very excited to combine 2 complementary businesses. The transaction checks all 3 boxes we require when evaluating M&A, strategic, financial and cultural. Growing the core is a key component of our strategy, and I'm really thrilled to have the opportunity to add high-quality capacity, meaning people, fleet and real estate to the United Rentals team. This will allow us to better serve customer demand over the long term. It will also accelerate our growth, all while generating compelling returns for our shareholders. It's really a win-win outcome. Things remain on track for a first quarter close and there are no further updates to provide you today.\nIn closing and building upon what I just discussed with our latest acquisition announcement, we remain focused on being the best rental company in the industry. Our unique value offering, industry-leading technology and our go-to-market approach, combined with our capital discipline, give me confidence that we're well positioned for both customers and shareholders for the long term. We continue to progress towards our 2028 aspirational financial goals, which we laid out in May of '23, and look forward to delivering on these results as we continue to execute our strategy.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted, and then will take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Matt just shared, we had a strong finish to the year, setting both fourth quarter and full year records for total revenue, rental revenue, EBITDA and EPS, which supported the attractive returns and significant free cash flow we also generated in 2024. So with that said, let's jump into the numbers.\nFourth quarter rental revenue was a record at $3.42 billion. That's a year-on-year increase of $303 million or 9.7%, supported again by growth from large projects and key verticals. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $177 million or 6.9%. Breaking this down, growth in our average fleet size contributed 4.1% to OER, while fleet productivity added another 4.3%, partially offset by assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental, ancillary and re-rent grew by 22% and 30%, respectively, adding a combined $126 million to revenue, driven primarily by strong growth in Specialty and hurricane-related work in the quarter.\nTurning to our used results. As Matt mentioned, we took advantage of a strong market to sell a record amount of fleet in the fourth quarter, generating proceeds of $452 million at an adjusted margin of 48.9% and a recovery rate of 53% on assets that were almost 8 years old on average.\nMoving to EBITDA, as I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was a fourth quarter record at $1.9 billion, translating to an increase of $91 million or 5%. Within this, rental gross profit increased 7% contributing an additional $136 million year-on-year. This was partially offset by used where the ongoing normalization of the market drove a 9% decline in used gross profit dollars translating to a $21 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.\nSG&A increased by $36 million year-over-year, which was in line with revenue growth, so good efficiency there. And finally, the EBITDA contribution from other non-rental lines of businesses increased $12 million, driven largely by strong new equipment sales.\nLooking at profitability. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4%, implying 210 basis points of compression. I'm sure we'll dig into this during Q&A, so I thought it might be helpful to frame some of the key factors here. The combination of used and stronger-than-expected new equipment sales were together about 80 basis points of year-on-year headwinds. Said another way, excluding these 2 factors, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been down about 130 basis points with flow-through a little better than 33%.\nCloser to the core and as you just heard me highlight, we had higher growth in ancillary and re-rent revenue that, as you know, come with lower margins. If we also adjust for these, our EBITDA margin would have been down about 60 basis points with implied flow-through of roughly 40%. While this is modestly below our long-term goal, it reflects our continued investment in key aspects of our strategy, including specialty, technology and capacity to support the long-term growth of our business during what we view as a slower phase of the cycle.\nAnd lastly, our adjusted earnings per share was a fourth quarter record at $11.59.\nShifting to CapEx. Fourth quarter gross rental CapEx was $469 million.\nMoving to returns and free cash flow. Our return on invested capital of 13% remained well above our weighted average cost of capital, while full year free cash flow totaled a robust $2.06 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with net leverage of 1.8x at the end of December and total liquidity of over $2.8 billion. I'll note, this was after returning a record of over $1.9 billion to shareholders in 2024, including $434 million via dividend and $1.5 billion through repurchases that reduced our share count by over 2.1 million shares.\nSo to wrap up both the quarter and the full year, we were very pleased with the results our team achieved in 2024. Now let's look forward and talk about our 2025 guidance, which I'll remind you, is standalone, meaning it does not include any contribution from H&E. As you've seen from the press release, we anticipate another record year.\nTotal revenue is expected in the range of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion, implying full year growth of 3.3% at midpoint. Within total revenue, I'll note that our used sales guidance is implied at roughly $1.5 billion or a mid-single-digit year-on-year decline on a percentage basis. This, in turn, implies a little faster growth within our core rental revenue, call it, mid-single digit on a percentage basis.\nWithin used, I'll add that we expect to sell around $2.8 billion of OEC translating to recovery rate in the low 50s versus the mid-50s in 2024, but in line with pre-pandemic norms. Our adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.45 billion. At the midpoint, excluding the impact of used, this implies flow-through in the 40s and flattish adjusted EBITDA margins versus as reported flow-through of around 30% and approximately 50 basis points of margin compression at the midpoint of guidance.\nOn the fleet side, our gross CapEx guidance is $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion with net CapEx of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Within this, we peg our 2025 maintenance CapEx at around $3.3 billion, implying growth CapEx of roughly $500 million at midpoint. And finally, we are guiding to another year of strong free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.\nTurning to capital allocation. One of the benefits of our balance sheet strategy and free cash generation are the flexibility they provide to invest in growth opportunities when they arise. As you know, we intend to capitalize on this through the pending acquisition of H&E where we will invest almost $5 billion at targeted returns well above our cost of capital. As previously shared, we are pausing our buyback program ahead of H&E and we intend to utilize our free cash flow in 2025 to reduce our leverage from roughly 2.3x on a pro forma basis to a goal of around 2x within 12 months of close.\nFinally, consistent with our strategy to return excess capital to our shareholders, I am very pleased to reiterate that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 10% to $1.79 per share, translating to an annualized dividend of $7.16.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call.\nAs you saw yesterday afternoon, we built upon our strong start to 2024 with another solid quarter. We're pleased with the growth, profitability, returns and free cash flow in the second quarter as the year continues to unfold in line with our expectations. Our reiterated guidance is further proof of this. And of course, the key to these results is our team's diligence in providing our full offering across GenRent and Specialty coupled with a steadfast commitment to safety, operational excellence and innovation. Without the hard work of our 27,000-plus employees, the results we'll be discussing this morning would not have been possible.\nOn our first quarter call, we discussed that we've doubled down on being the best partner for our customers. And this unwavering focus on the customer is critical and drives our strategy every day, whether in our go-to-market approach, our value proposition or in our investment decisions. We've built a diversified business model that enables us to serve our customers with broadened relationships and generate shareholder value. I'm pleased with how far we've come as a company over the last decade and for the opportunities ahead. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our expectations for 2024 and what gives me confidence that United Rentals will continue to win in the marketplace. And then Ted will discuss the financials in detail before we open up the call for Q&A.\nSo let's start with the second quarter results. Our total revenue grew by 6% year-over-year to $3.8 billion. And within this, rental revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion, both second quarter records. Fleet productivity increased by 4.6%, supported by continued industry discipline. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a second quarter record of almost $1.8 billion, translating to a margin of nearly 47%, and adjusted EPS grew by 8% to $10.70, another second quarter record.\nNow let's turn to customer activity. We saw growth in both our GenRent and Specialty businesses. And within Specialty, we continue to see growth across all product offerings. In fact, even excluding the benefit of Yak, Specialty rental grew 18% year-over-year. Additionally, we opened 27 Specialty cold starts, which puts us at 42 year-to-date, and we remain on track to open at least 50 this year.\nBy vertical, we saw growth across both construction led by nonres and our industrial end markets, with particular strength in manufacturing. It will come as no surprise that we saw multiple new projects in the quarter across data centers, utilities, health care, battery manufacturing and infrastructure. And if you're a soccer fan, you'll be excited to know that Freedom Park in Miami kicked off as well. Additionally, the used market remains healthy, allowing us to sell a second quarter record amount of OEC. We believe the demand for used equipment will remain strong and still expect to generate around $1.5 billion of proceeds this year.\nTurning to CapEx. We spent $1.4 billion in the second quarter in line with our expectations as we added fleet to meet the seasonal uptick in customer activity. For the full year, our CapEx guide remains unchanged. Subsequently, year-to-date, free cash flow was nearly $1.1 billion. We continue to see our strong cash generation as a key differentiator and remain confident in our ability to produce over $2 billion this year. And as you've heard me say before, our flexible business model coupled with our industry-leading profitability enables us to drive positive free cash flow throughout a cycle and support long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow turning to capital allocation. We returned $484 million to shareholders in the quarter via share buybacks and our dividend. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape and we continue to plan to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders this year. The theme you've heard consistently so far today is that 2024 is playing out as we originally expected. As you saw from our updated guidance, we narrowed the range of expectations for revenue and EBITDA with the midpoint unchanged while keeping CapEx and free cash flow intact. But let's step back from the remainder of this year and look at what gives us conviction in our business even further out.\nFirst, we remain diligent in leveraging our unique value proposition as we work through the myriad of tailwinds we've discussed many times. In fact, we've been successful in each area. The outlook for large infrastructure projects, ship manufacturing, auto and energy and power all remain positive. Data center construction has also been an area of focus, and we will continue to win in this vertical as well. All of these type of projects play into our one-stop shop offering and are great examples of United Rentals having all business units accounted for as we help solve more of our customers' problems.\nAs an example, last month, I visited a large data center project we had recently won. Beyond providing the core GenRent and Specialty products that might immediately jump to your mind, whether that be dirt, aerial, power or trench, we're also supporting their safety and security requirements. We're providing secured access to the site with our advanced turnstyles and access control systems, in addition to educating workers with our United Academy Safety Training. Our experience and ability to help them solve their logistics from soup to nuts, differentiate us in the marketplace and allow us to further strengthen our customer relationship.\nSecond, we continue to grow with new products. Our acquisition of Yak, which has now been part of the United Rentals family for over 4 months, is a perfect example of this. The integration is well underway and progressing on track. And this is a textbook example of how we can leverage our existing customer relationships to accelerate growth for the new product.\nAnd finally, we work with our customers to ensure we are their partner of choice. This is enabled by our 1 UR culture and is augmented by the investments we continue to make in technology. Our size and scale allow us to invest aggressively in both customer-facing technology, such as telematics and total control as well as internal technology that drives operating efficiencies across logistics, fleet management and repair and maintenance. And when put to task and working together, these investments allow us to further entangle ourselves with our customers, thus enabling future growth.\nSo to wrap things up, we're happy with how 2024 is playing out and we're confident that our extensive competitive advantages, combined with our flexible and resilient business model allow us to drive profitable growth, strong free cash flow and compelling shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted before we take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Matt highlighted, Q2 played out as expected, with healthy demand and strong execution, driving record second quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Looking forward, or reaffirm guidance at the midpoint for total revenue, EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow reflects our continued confidence in delivering another year of solid growth, strong profitability, healthy returns and significant free cash flow. As importantly, we remain focused on prudently allocating capital to drive shareholder value.\nSo with that, let's jump into the numbers. Second quarter rental revenue was a record $3.215 billion. That's a year-on-year increase of $234 million or 7.8% supported by growth in key verticals and large projects. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $143 million or 5.8%. Growth in our average fleet size contributed 2.7% to OER, while fleet productivity added 4.6% partially offset by assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental, ancillary and re-rent revenues were higher by $91 million or 17.5%.\nTurning to our used results. Second quarter proceeds of $365 million were in line with expectations at a healthy adjusted margin of 51.8%. The strength and depth of the market were evident in the fact that we sold a second quarter record amount of OEC at a robust recovery rate of 59%, in line with first quarter levels.\nMoving to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA was a second quarter record at $1.77 billion, translating to an increase of $74 million or 4.4%. Within this, rental contributed $127 million year-on-year. Outside of rental and similar to the first quarter, used sales were a $30 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA driven by the ongoing normalization of the used market that we've discussed over the last several quarters. SG&A increased $23 million year-on-year, reflecting a larger business but was consistent with year ago levels as a percentage of sales. And finally, the EBITDA contribution from other lines of nonrental business were flat year-on-year.\nLooking at second quarter profitability, our adjusted EBITDA margin was in line with expectations at 46.9%. The 80 basis points of year-on-year compression was almost entirely due to the used dynamics I just discussed. Excluding the impact of used, our second quarter margin was down just 10 basis points with implied flow-through of 44%. And finally, our adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to a second quarter record of $10.70.\nShifting to CapEx, gross rental CapEx was $1.4 billion, which is in line with our forecast and historical seasonality.\nTurning to returns and free cash flow. Our return on invested capital of 13.5% remained well above our weighted average cost of capital, while year-to-date free cash flow totaled $1.065 billion. Our balance sheet remains very strong with net leverage of 1.8x at the end of June and total liquidity of almost $3.3 billion. I'll add that we continue to have no long-term note maturities until 2027 and a very distributed tower thereafter. And all of this was after returning a record $969 million to shareholders year-to-date, including $219 million via dividends and $750 million through repurchases. I'll add, this has reduced our share count by over 1.1 million shares since January.\nNow let's shift to the updated guidance we shared last night, which reflects our confidence in delivering another year of solid results. As previously mentioned, we are maintaining the midpoints for all metrics while narrowing the ranges for both revenue and EBITDA as we normally do at this time of the year. In terms of specifics, for total revenue, we've narrowed our guidance to a range of $15.05 billion to $15.35 billion, implying total revenue full year growth of just over 6% at midpoint. Within this, I'll note that our used sales guidance is unchanged at roughly $1.5 billion of proceeds on approximately $2.5 billion of OEC sold.\nOn adjusted EBITDA, we've narrowed the range to $7.09 billion to $7.24 billion. I'll note that our guidance for gross CapEx, net CapEx and free cash flow are all unchanged. And importantly, we are still committed to returning a record $1.9 billion to shareholders this year, which translates to almost $30 per share or a current return of capital yield of about 4%.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.\nBefore we begin, please note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.\nA summary of these uncertainties is included in the safe harbor statement contained in the company's press release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.unitedrentals.com.\nPlease note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations. You should also note that the company's press release and today's call include references to non-GAAP terms such as free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nPlease refer to the back of the company's recent investor presentations to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSpeaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. As you saw yesterday afternoon, 2024 is off to a strong start and playing out as expected, and I'm pleased with our results across growth, margins and fleet productivity, all executed through the lens of putting the customer-first and with an unwavering focus on safety. Coming into the year, we knew the key to success would be doubling down on being the best partner for our customers, and that's just what we're doing. And we're meeting their needs and find opportunities to deepen our relationships with them. For example, we broadened our product offering to include matting solutions and we continue to invest in technology to improve the customer experience. Additionally, we're executing on our plan to open more cold starts.\nAnd just as critically, we're doing all of this while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency. The team continues to demonstrate its commitment to our strategy, and we remain confident this will be another year of profitable growth. Today, I'll start with a recap of our first quarter results and then discuss our recent acquisition of Yak, followed by what's driving our optimism for the year. And finally, I'll give a very recent example of our 1 UR culture at work, which, in my mind, is a true differentiator.\nSo let's start with some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our total revenue grew by 6% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a first quarter record. And within this, rental revenue grew by 7%. Fleet productivity increased by a healthy 4% and and adjusted EBITDA increased to a first quarter record of $1.6 billion, translating to a margin of 45.5%. And finally, adjusted EPS grew by 15% and $9.15, another first quarter record.\nNow let's turn to customer activity. We continue to see growth across both our Gen Rent and Specialty businesses. And within Specialty, we delivered double-digit growth across all lines of business. By vertical, we saw growth across both construction led by non-res and our industrial end markets with particular strength in manufacturing, utilities and downstream. And we continue to see numerous new projects across many of the same areas we've discussed the last several quarters, including power generation, data centers, automotive and infrastructure.\nAdditionally, the used market remains strong, allowing us to sell a first quarter record amount of OEC. In turn, we spent $595 million in the quarter on rental CapEx, and this is consistent with our expectation. As a result, free cash flow was $860 million in the quarter. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout a cycle, while simultaneously funding growth is a critical differentiator.\nThe combination of our profitability and capital efficiency, coupled with the flexibility we've engineered into our operations, enables us to consistently generate strong free cash flow and create long-term value.\nNow turning to capital allocation. Our #1 goal is supporting growth while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. And after funding organic growth, including 15 cold starts, and completing the Yak acquisition, we also returned $485 million to shareholders in the quarter via share buybacks and our dividend, all while remaining comfortably within our targeted leverage range.\nSpeaking of Yak, I want to share some initial thoughts now that we started the integration process. This acquisition is a textbook example of our M&A strategy at work. Through Yak, we've added more capabilities for our one-stop shop platform, enabling us to be even more responsive to our customers, while also generating attractive returns for our shareholders. And for those of you not familiar, Yak provides temporary access roadways and surface protection to any site with uneven or soft surfaces, where you need to safely move and operate heavy equipment.\nAnd similar to our purchase of General Finance in 2021, Yak is a leader in its market. Yak still has plenty of room for growth as we bring this capability into our network. Since we've closed the deal, we spend a lot of time with their team, and we're even more excited with the potential here.\nTurning to our updated outlook. As we look to the rest of 2024, we remain optimistic about the opportunities for growth. And thus far, the year is playing out as expected. Our updated guidance reflects the addition of Yak with our underlying expectations unchanged. Customer confidence remains strong while our team in the field is focused on the opportunities ahead. And while these indicators are tangible examples of what gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance, it's a team's daily actions, which further bolster our belief that we will continue to deliver strong shareholder value while supporting our customers in our normal operations and times of emergency.\nA good example of this was our response to the devastating news of the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore back on March 26. In true United Rentals fashion, we were all hands on deck helping with the immediate urging -- emergency response [ in ] ongoing work. This support included a broad range of assets, including mobile storage, power, like towers, portable sanitation and fencing, real and dirt equipment. And what's more, through the acquisition of Yak, which had just been completed, we're also able to provide the maths needed at the site from the operations. This is a perfect example of our differentiated business model, where we provide unmatched support through our one-stop shop offering to our customers and ensure they can safely and efficiently focus on their own operations.\nIt's also a true testament to our culture and the people that work for United Rentals. So in summary, we're excited by both the immediate opportunities, particularly on large projects, and the longer-term outlook we see. We've built a resilient company with a well-proven strategy that positions us to continue to drive profitable growth, strong free cash flow and compelling shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted, and then we'll take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Edward Grace\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Matt highlighted, the year is off to a strong start as healthy demand and strong execution supported first quarter records across revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Consistent with our strategy, we remain focused on allocating capital both rental CapEx and M&A investment to drive profitable growth while also returning excess cash to our shareholders. Combined, this supports the solid earnings growth, free cash flow and returns, you see embedded in our updated 2024 guidance.\nSo with that, let's jump into the numbers. First quarter rental revenue was a record $2.93 billion, that's a year-on-year increase of $189 million or 6.9%, supported by both the market tailwinds we've been discussing as well as our strong position in large projects and key verticals. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $138 million, or 6.1%. Within this, growth in our average fleet size contributed 3.6%, while fleet productivity added 4% and partially offset by assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental, ancillary and re-rent revenues were higher by $51 million or approximately 10.8%. Turning to used results. Supported by the strong demand Matt highlighted, our first quarter results were consistent with expectations. Used revenue came in at $383 million at a healthy adjusted margin of 53.3%.\nas we've talked about for the past few quarters, our used margins reflect the ongoing normalization of the used market following the extraordinary conditions created by supply chain issues that peaked in 2022.\nFrom an OEC recovery perspective, which we view as a key indicator of the health of the used market, our proceeds equated to better than $0.59 on the dollar versus $0.50 to $0.55 prior to COVID. So another quarter of very solid results there. Moving to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA was a first quarter record at $1.59 billion, reflecting an increase of $84 million or 5.6%. The year-on-year dollar change includes a $108 million increase from rental. Outside of rental, used sales and SG&A were headwinds to adjusted EBITDA of about $27 million and $4 million, respectively, while other non-rental lines of businesses were a $7 million tailwind.\nNotably, SG&A as a percent of sales declined 40 basis points, setting a new first quarter best at 11.2%. Looking at first quarter profitability. Our reported adjusted EBITDA margin was a healthy 45.5%. Due to these dynamics, I just discussed, consolidated margins compressed 30 basis points year-on-year, implying flow-through of 42%, excluding use, however, our core EBITDA margins increased 70 basis points, equating the flow-through of 54% in the quarter. And finally, our adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to a first quarter record of $9.15.\nShifting to CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $595 million, which was in line with both our expectations and historical seasonality from a percentage of full year perspective. Turning to return on invested capital and free cash flow, ROIC increased 50 basis points year-on-year to 13.6%, which remains well above our weighted average cost of capital while free cash flow was off to a strong start at $869 million.\nMoving to the balance sheet, our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was a very solid 1.7x while our total liquidity was just under $3.6 billion. And as a reminder, we continue to have no long-term note maturities until 2027 and a very manageable distribution maturities thereafter through 2034.\nWithin the quarter, I'd highlight that we issued $1.1 billion of 10-year senior unsecured notes to fund the Yak acquisition, and we're very pleased with the market reception. The notes priced at a coupon of [ 6.18% ] representing both the lowest coupon and the tightest credit spread to treasuries in the high-yield market for all [ tenure assurers ] since August of 2022. Notably, and probably most importantly, the transaction also marked the lowest spread to treasuries that United Rentals has ever achieved for a bond of any tenor. While this was driven by a number of factors, we view it as further evidence that credit markets continue to reward the company for its track record of impressive growth, strong execution, smart capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management.\nLooking forward, you saw last night that we raised our full year guidance to include the acquisition of Yak, which is expected to contribute approximately $300 million in total revenue and $140 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024. In terms of the specifics on the updated outlook, we've raised our guidance for total revenue to a range of $14.95 billion to $15.45 billion, implying full year growth of just over 6% at midpoint.\nWithin total revenue, I'll note that our used sales guidance is unchanged at roughly $1.5 billion. We raised our adjusted EBITDA range by $140 million to $7.04 billion to $7.29 billion. On the fleet side, we've raised both our gross and net CapEx guidance by $100 million to $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion and $2 billion to $2.3 billion, respectively. And finally, we've raised our free cash flow guidance by $50 million to a range of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion after funding growth. This is enabling us to return over $1.9 billion to shareholders this year, which translates to about $29 per share or a current return of capital yield of roughly 4.5%. So with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

Speaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Our theme for 2023 was raising the bar. And today, I'm very pleased to discuss our record fourth quarter which capped a number of notable achievements by our team and enabled us to indeed raise the bar this past year with record revenue, earnings and returns.\nThe team did this by continuing to serve our customers with an unmatched commitment to operational excellence and a laser focus on safety, all while integrating Ahern, our second largest acquisition ever. Today, I'll start with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, followed by what's driving our optimism for 2024; and finally, our updated leverage and capital deployment strategies.\nSo let's start with some of the highlights from the fourth quarter. Our total revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, a fourth quarter record. And within this, rental revenue grew by 13.5%. Fleet productivity increased by 2.4% on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased almost 10% to a fourth quarter record of over $1.8 billion, translating to a healthy margin of 48%. And adjusted EPS grew by 16% to $11.26.\nFor the full year, rental CapEx of $3.5 billion was in line with our guidance. And I'll add that with the supply chain largely recovered, we now expect the quarterly cadence of our CapEx spend to be more closely matched to historical patterns. 2023 free cash flow exceeded $2.3 billion, we view our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout the cycle as a hallmark for the company and a testament to both the profitability and flexibility of our business model.\nMoreover, and this may be the most important thing to convey. The durability of our free cash generation provides us tremendous flexibility to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to customer activity. We continue to see broad-based demand across geographies, verticals and customer segments. Industrial end markets saw healthy growth, led by industrial manufacturing and power.\nWithin our construction markets, both infrastructure and non res continued to show solid growth year-over-year as our customers kicked off new projects across a diverse range of markets. And these include battery plants semiconductor-related jobs, power, infrastructure as well as data centers. Geographically, we continue to see strength across the business and specialty specifically delivered another strong quarter, with rental revenue up 15% year-on-year, reflecting double-digit growth across all businesses.\nFurthermore, we opened 10 cold starts during the quarter, resulting in 49% for the full year. Finally, turning to capital allocation. In addition to the investments we made in 2023, we returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another year of growth, led by large projects. This is supported by customer sentiment indicators, solid backlogs and most importantly, feedback from our field teams.\nAnd finally, and I'll be quick here because I don't want to steal too much of heads thunder, but I'm very pleased to announce our updated capital deployment and leverage strategies, which cover our plans to return nearly $2 billion of cash to shareholders this year and a reduced leverage target of 1.5x to 2.5x. This announcement reflects our work towards building an even stronger company and driving shareholder value.\nAnd what's more, this comes after fully funding growth. Finally, before I get to my concluding remarks, I want to share with you all that we hosted our annual management meeting in Indianapolis earlier this month. This provided an opportunity for over 2,500 United Rentals leaders to gather and build momentum as we execute on our strategy. It also highlighted our incredible team, which is a real competitive differentiator for us and offered an opportunity to remind ourselves of the culture, we work so hard to strengthen and maintain.\nSo it's no surprise when you see everyone in action, why the team continues to win accolades, including recently from the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. In closing, I'll repeat what you've heard me say many times before. When it's what continues to be relevant and true. We are building the best business to serve our customers, our scale, go-to-market approach, technology and one-stop shop offering across gen rent and specialty are unmatched.\nOur team puts customers at the center of everything we do, giving me confidence that we're well positioned to continue to outpace the industry and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. We expect 2024 to be another record year for our company. And longer term, we continue to march towards our 2028 aspirational goals that we shared with you last May at our Investor Day.\nAnd I'm so proud of all our teammates will help us deliver these results. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted, and then we'll take your questions. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Grace\n\nVP of Investor Relations & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments by adding some more color on our record fourth quarter results before pivoting toward 2024 guidance, which points to another strong year for the company. One quick reminder before I jump into the numbers. As usual, the figures I'll be discussing are as reported. Except where I call them at is pro forma, which is to say the prior period is adjusted to include Ahern's stand-alone results.\nSo with that said, let's get into the numbers. Fourth quarter rental revenue was a record $3.12 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of $372 million or 13.5% supported by diverse strength across our end markets and our strong positioning on large projects. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $313 million or 13.9%. An increase in our average fleet size contributed 15.1%, while as-reported fleet productivity added 0.3%, partially offset by assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $61 million or 14.2%, which was consistent with rental revenue growth. I'll add that re-rent declined $2 million year-on-year. On a pro forma basis, which, as you know, is how we look at our results, rental revenue increased 7.6% year-on-year with fleet productivity up 2.4%, reflecting a healthy rate environment that continues to be supported by good industry discipline. Turning to used results.\nFourth quarter proceeds increased better than 7% to $438 million as we continue to take advantage of a strong retail market to refresh our fleet at attractive returns by recovering roughly 62% for our original fleet cost. Our adjusted use margin was flat sequentially at 55.3%, while the year-over-year decline in margin reflected the ongoing normalization of the used market that we have been talking about for the last several quarters.\nMoving to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a record of $1.81 billion, reflecting an increase of $162 million or 10%. The year-on-year dollar change includes a $197 million increase in rental within which OER contributed $195 million, while ancillary and re-rent added $2 million on a combined basis. Outside of rental, used sales were a headwind of about $10 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses were up $4 million. SG&A in the quarter increased $29 million due primarily to increases in variable costs. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&A declined about 100 basis points to 10.5% of total revenue. Looking at fourth quarter profitability.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 150 basis points year-on-year to 48.5% due largely to the combined impact of Ahern and used margins. When looked at pro forma for EBITDA margin, [ XCU ] was down just 20 basis points, translating to flow-through of 46% versus the 38% you can see on an as-reported basis. And finally, our adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $11.26 Shifting to CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $430 million, reflecting a return to a more normalized seasonal cadence supported by improvements in the supply chain.\nYou can also see this in our net rental CapEx, which declined $8 million. Turning to return on invested capital and free cash flow, ROIC increased 90 basis points year-on-year to 13.6%, exceeding our weighted average cost of capital by over 260 basis points. Free cash flow also remains a good story with the year coming in at just over $2.3 billion, translating to a free cash margin of 16.1%, even as we continue to fund significant organic growth. The business continues to generate very strong free cash flow on both an absolute and relative basis. As Matt said, this provides us with a lot of flexibility to drive shareholder value across the cycle through both investment and growth and the return of excess capital to our investors. More on this in a bit.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter improved 0.2 of a turn sequentially to 1.6x and while our total liquidity exceeded $3.3 billion at year's end. And as a reminder, we continue to have no long-term note maturities until 2027. Notably, all of this was after returning over $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2023. This included $1 billion through share repurchases and $406 million via dividends. Combined, this translated to the return of over $20 per share during the year.\nNow let's look forward and talk more about our 2024 guidance. Total revenue is expected in the range of $14.65 billion to $15.15 billion, implying full year growth of about 4% at midpoint. Within total revenue, I'll note that our used sales guidance has implied at roughly $1.5 billion were down mid-single digits year-on-year on a percentage basis, which implies slightly better growth within our core rental revenue.\nWithin used, I'll add that we expect to sell around $2.5 billion of OEC translating to a recovery rate of about 60% versus roughly 66% in 2023, but historical norms that are more in the 50% to 55% range. Our adjusted EBITDA range is $6.9 billion to $7.15 billion. At midpoint, excluding the impact of used, this implies flow-through in the 40s and flattish adjusted EBITDA margins versus as reported flow through of around 30% and approximately 70 basis points of year-on-year margin compression at the midpoint of guidance.\nOn the fleet side, our gross CapEx guidance is $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion with net CapEx of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. And finally, we are guiding to another strong year of free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Now let's shift to our updated balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. First and foremost, we remain focused on funding growth where we can attract -- generate attractive returns, both organically and through acquisitions.\nBeyond that, our goal is to allocate excess free cash flow to drive shareholder value. And to this end, last night, we announced several exciting things. First, consistent with the intentions we shared a year ago when we introduced our dividend we are increasing our quarterly payment by 10% to $1.63 per share or $6.52 per share annualized. I'll add that it remains our plan to consistently grow our dividend in line with long-term earnings. Second, we plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of common stock in 2024, an increase of $500 million versus what we bought in 2023.\nIn total, we intend to return over $1.9 billion to shareholders this year, equating to almost $30 per share or a return of capital yield of over 5% based on our current share price. Lastly, and importantly, we were able to do this while also lowering our targeted full cycle leverage range by 0.5 turn to 1.5x to 2.5x. As a reminder, this production follows the similar half-turn reduction we announced in mid-2019. As most of you know, this is something we've been working towards with the idea of building an even stronger company and critically driving shareholder value.\nWhat's more -- this has all been achieved after fully funding growth. Just to provide some perspective. Since 2019, when we introduced the first leg of our enhanced capital allocation strategy, our revenues increased by more than 50%, our EBITDA has increased closer to 60%, and our earnings per share has grown more than 130%, while at the same time, our leverage ratio has declined from 2.6x at the end of 2019 and to 1.6x at the end of 2023.\nThis combination results has supported very strong shareholder value creation that our team is very proud of and remains very focused on sustaining. So with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery you may begin.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThank you operator and good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call this morning. As you saw in our third quarter results, the team continues to raise the bar, as evidenced by the new high-water marks we set across this quarter's revenue, adjusted EBITDA and returns. As you've heard me say many times, our employees are the key to our results and their focus on safely supporting our customers is paramount to generating value for our shareholders. And I'm most thankful that our team again delivered a company-wide recordable rate below one. This goes without saying, but safety is not only a differentiator in the eyes of the customer but it's also critical that we take care of our most valuable assets, our team. Looking towards the rest of the year, our reaffirmed guidance for 2023, reflects our confidence in the outlook of our business and that is I'll touch more on later. This is driven by both what we hear from the field and the tailwinds we see on the horizon. More generally, we are confident in the strategy that we've developed. The competitive advantages we've created over the last decade position us well to continue to outpace the industry as we drive towards our long-term goals.\n\nNow, let's dig into the third quarter results. Total revenue rose by 23% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, a third quarter record. Within this, rental revenue was up 18% with broad-based growth across verticals, regions and customer segments. Place productivity increased 1.5% on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to a third quarter record of $1.85 billion, translating to a margin of over 49%. While adjusted EPS grew by over 26% to a third quarter record. And finally, our return on invested capital expanded to a new record of 13.7%.\n\nSo let's dive into a bit more of the details behind these results. Used equipment sales more than doubled year-over-year to $366 million as we normalized volumes and rotated out older fleet after holding back in 2022. Rental CapEx was in line with expectations at just over $1 billion, reflecting a more normal quarterly cadence. And as the supply chains recovered, our need to pull spend forward should be behind us. And now to Ahern. As we approach the first anniversary of the deal, the integration remains on track and highlight continues to be the quality of the team. As you know, people are one of the key components we add when we bring companies on board and integrate them into United Rentals. Looking forward, this added capacity combined with my comments on CapEx and supply chains should position us well to serve our customers as we enter 2024. Ahern's is another great example of the strength we have in leveraging our balance sheet as a way to benefit both our customers and our shareholders.\n\nNow, let's turn to customer activity and demand. Key vertical saw broad-based growth led by industrial manufacturing, metal and mining and power. Non-res construction grew 9% year-over-year. And within this, our customers kicked off new projects across the board, including numerous EV in semiconductor related jobs, solar power facilities, infrastructure projects, data centers and health care. Geographically, we continued to see growth across all gen rent regions. And our specialty business delivered another excellent quarter, with organic rental revenue up 16% year-on-year and double digit gains in most regions. Within specialty, we opened 14 cold starts during the quarter, resulting in 39 new specialty location openings this year.\n\nTurning to capital allocation, in addition to the investments we've made in growth, we returned $350 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends this quarter and remain on track to return over $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders this year. As we look ahead, we feel confident in our outlook and this is supported by the ABC's Contractor Confidence Index, which remains strong across the third quarter as did its backlog indicator, the Dodge Momentum Index, which advanced sequentially in September. Furthermore, non-res construction spending and non-res construction appointment both remained solid. And most importantly, our own customer confidence index continues to reflect optimism, while early indications from our field team on their expectations for '24 are also encouraging.\n\nFinally, I'd like to acknowledge the team for their efforts in earning our company's recent selection to the 2023 Time magazine's World's Best Companies and the U.S. News and World Report's Best Companies to Work For list. Recognition like this comes as no surprise when you see our employees dedication and hard work in the field day in and day out.\n\nSo to wrap up my comments today, Q3 was a strong quarter. We remain very pleased with how the year is playing out. Looking forward, the opportunity ahead of us around large projects is unlike anything in my career and we're uniquely positioned in the rental industry to win more than our fair share of the 2 trillion plus of investment we see on the horizon. Not only do we have the scale, technology and one stop shop solutions to make us a preferred partner but we have a history of execution our customers can rely on. We set high expectations for 2023 and I'm proud of the results, we're delivering. We feel good about the rest of the year and what's ahead for United Rentals and our investors. And with that I'll hand the call over to Ted before we open the lines to Q&A. Ted, over to you.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nThanks Matt and good morning everyone. As you saw in our third quarter release, our team again delivered strong results that were consistent with our expectations and importantly, keeps us on track for another record year. I'll add that we continue to feel very good about our prospects beyond 2023, based on our strategy and the tailwind we've discussed extensively. Although remains a little premature to say too much about next year given where we sit in our planning cycle, I will say that 2024 is shaping up to be another year of growth, certainly more to come there in January with our focus today on our third quarter performance and the balance of the year.\n\nOne quick reminder before I jump into the numbers. As usual, the figures I'll be discussing are as reported except where I call them out as pro forma, which is to say the prior year period adjusted include Ahern standalone results from the third quarter of last year. So with all that said, let's get into the numbers.\n\nThird quarter rental revenue was a record at over $3.2 billion. The year-over-year increase of $492 million or 18% supported by diverse strength across our end markets, as you heard Matt say. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $413 million or 18.5% in. An increase in our average fleet size contributed 22.2% to that growth, partially offset by a 2.2% decline in as reported fleet productivity and assumed fleet inflation of 1.5%. Also within rental ancillary revenues were higher by $83 million or 19.7%, while re rent declined $4 million. On a pro forma basis, which as you know is how we look at our results, rental revenue increased by a robust 10.2% with fleet productivity up 1.5%, reflecting a healthy rate environment that continues to be supported by good industry discipline.\n\nTurning to use results, third quarter proceeds roughly doubled to $366 million, reflecting more normalized volumes as we continue to refresh our fleet. The decline in our third quarter adjusted use margin to 55.2% was largely due to expanded channel mix required to drive higher volumes, the impact of some cleanup actions we took on Ahern's fleet and the normalization of supply demand dynamics. Importantly, we continued to take advantage of a robust used market by driving strong volume growth in our retail sales at attractive pricing. I'll also note that our average fleet age was 51.6 months at the end of the quarter, which is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMoving to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a record $1.85 billion, reflecting an increase of $329 million or 22%. The dollar change includes a $264 million increase from rental within which, OER contributed $252 million and ancillary added $19 million while re-rent declined $7 million year-on-year. Outside of rental, used sales added about $85 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $15 million. While SG&A in the quarter did increase $35 million year-on-year as a percentage of sales declined to 180 basis points to 9.9% of total revenue, reflecting another quarter of very good cost efficiency.\n\nLooking at third quarter profitability, our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points on an as reported basis but increased 20 basis points on a pro forma basis to 49.1%. This translates to as reported flow through of 46% and pro forma flow through a better than 50%, notably if we excluded the impact of use in the quarter, our core fluke flow through exceeded 53% and was in line with second quarter results. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 27% to a third quarter record of $11.73. Shifting to CapEx, gross rental Capex was $1.03 billion versus net rental CapEx of $664 million, the $257 million decline in net rental CapEx largely reflects a return to more normalized used sales levels this year. Year to date, gross rental CapEx through the third quarter has totaled almost $3.1 billion representing about 90% of our full year CapEx plan, which is in line with both our expectations and historical year to date level.\n\nAt this point, it is our sense that the supply chains have largely normalized which should enable us to return to more typical quarterly cadences going forward and better match the timing of deliveries with seasonal demand. Turning to return on invested capital and free cash flow, rent set a new record at 13.7% on a trailing 12 month basis and remains well above our cost of capital while free cash flow also remains a good story. The quarter came in at $339 million translating to a trailing 12-month free cash margin of 12.8% all while continuing to fund robust growth. Moving to the balance sheet, our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was flat sequentially at 1.8 times while our liquidity totaled $2.7 billion with no long-term note maturities until 2027. Notably, all of this was after returning $1.05 billion to shareholders year to date, including $750 million through share repurchases and $305 million via dividends.\n\nSo let's shift to the guidance we shared last night. We reaffirmed within our ranges for total revenue EBITDA and free cash flow, reflecting our continued confidence in delivering a record year. Within this, we raised the midpoint of total revenue by $50 million to a range of $14.1 to $14.3 billion, reflecting cleanup actions being taken to dispose of some older fleet acquired that comes with no margin benefit. Just to avoid any confusion, that is to say if they were just being sold at the values they are recorded at on our balance sheet. You see this in our implied used sales guidance of $1.5 billion at midpoint, which is an increase of $50 million versus our prior guidance. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is $6.775 billion to $6.875 billion which maintains the midpoint at $6.825 billion. And finally, I'll point out that we expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 to $2.5 billion, of which we'll return a little over $1.4 billion to our investors through repurchases and dividends. This equates to more than $20 per share or around a 5% yield on return of capital at current share price levels.\n\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to the operator. Operator could you please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will open the floor for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press the star and 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star 2. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1.\n\nOur first question will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSure, David. Now without giving guidance, I'll just try to help out first on your first part of the fleet productivity. I think you captured it well, we absolutely expect next year to have positive fleet productivity. The anniversary is a very tough--and even on a pro forma basis, when you think about this year, we still had tough comps from a time utilization perspective and we've talked about that over that unusual time that, just, we didn't feel was healthy and put way too much hand to mouth orders and customer relationships at risk. So we've run a really strong time this year, as I told you guys in July, back over what we were in '19, and we think this is a more appropriate level so we wouldn't expect time to be a headwind next year.\n\nAnd with that being said, the industry still needs to get it right. So when we think about the two largest contributors to fleet productivity, we have one flat and the other one positive and then mix will be what mix will be, we certainly expect to have positive fleet productivity next year. And as far as fleet CapEx cadence, we certainly, I think the supply chain it's not 100% back to normal, but probably close, probably about 90%. There is still a couple of categories, high time yield assets that we can't get it as quickly as we want, but frankly, I don't think we're going to able to frontload that either because it's just an [inaudible] supply. So I think a more normalized cadence is the right way to think about what we'll do from a capital perspective and we're not going to give CapEx guidance right now, but think about off of our basis, $21 billion of fleet, we usually want to sell 11% or 12% of the fleet year to keep it fresh and as Ted mentioned in his comments, we're really pleased that we got back to pre-pandemic fleet days and we want to keep that rolling.\n\nRoughly if you think about those numbers, you're talking about somewhere between $2.3, $2.5 billion of fleet sold to get that 11% to 12% and if we think about the replacement CapEx on that at this point, certainly higher than 15, let's just round up to 20. When you are talking about somewhere between $2.8 to $3 billion of CapEx replacement next year, depending on how much we sell and I'd use that as a baseline and anything over and above that we'll obviously communicate in January, that will be our growth CapEx. We do expect '24 to be a growth year and we expect there will be some growth CapEx, but we're just not, we just haven't worked through the planning process yet, we'll give you better guidance in January.\n\nI'll answer a little bit of it and I'll let Ted jump in here. Certainly, we always talk about the use of our capital is going to be growing business. So first and foremost, feed the organic growth that to meet the demand that our customers are expecting us to meet and then secondly, M&A, if we find find opportunities where we can be a better owner of a business, we certainly have shown a history of that and frankly, we're pretty good at it so why not utilize the balance sheet for that. That pipeline remains robust, but we have a high threshold so I'm not pointing to anything imminent other than the fact that we're always looking and we will have a specific lien to any new products, we can add or specialty, but then also to add capacity like we did with a couple of deals including Ahern in this past year. As far as after we've used capital for growth I'll let Ted take that.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nThanks for the question, David. So as everybody saw we're at leverage, about 1.8 at the end of this quarter and implied guidance would have us at around 1.6 at year end so a little bit below that bottom threshold, we introduced in 2019 is 2. We do think the strategy overall served us very well and it accomplished a lot of what it was intended to accomplish which primarily was to allocate excess free cash flow to reduce equity volatility and improve valuation. And so when we measure kind of our absolute relative data, when we look at our absolute relative multiples, we think that has been quite successful in delivering what we wanted. In terms of what's next, certainly that's something we've talked about that we're still working on. We would expect to have an update for the fleet as we introduce our '24 guidance and other related capital allocation programs that'll be underpinned by that plan. So more to come there in January.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nYes, so if we look at that gen rent rental gross margin, I'd say in line with our expectations--while you did see the as reported margin down 320 basis points versus 270 last quarter, pretty minor when you convert that into dollars. You'd be talking about the 50 basis points being equivalent to about $12 million of cost on a revenue base of about $2.3 billion. There's always puts and takes within cost structures as everybody knows, depreciation was part of that, so if you think about that 50 basis points--the incremental depreciation we recognized in the quarter as we go through final purchase accounting on Ahern, it was probably 30 of those basis points would have been captured in that and otherwise you always have onetime cost or other cost dynamics that may be hitting you. We don't think there's really much to be made of it. The question is very fair, I wanted to ask, in the scheme of things given the numbers I just walked through--I think it's pretty, yes, we've characterized that more as quarter on quarter noise. Within specialty, so you saw flat margins, I guess year-on-year off record of 52.2%, so very strong performance there. There really wasn't much to call out, we did have some mix shifts within the different pieces of specialty that would've been relative headwinds, but again, if we can grow a business at 16% and generate 52% margins, we feel really good about that.\n\nRob Wertheimer - Founding Partner and Machinery Analyst, Melius Research\n\nPerfect, that answers that. If I'm allowed, you guys have some experience with megaprojects by now and I know there's a lot of different kinds of megaprojects coming from LNG to airport semiconductors to whatever but there is a lot of questions--if commercial or office or whatever construction declines and megas rise, do you have a sense of on a dollar for dollar basis, you lose a dollar on one and on the other, is that materially different on mix?\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nMaterially different on what? Rob.\n\nRob Wertheimer - Founding Partner and Machinery Analyst, Melius Research\n\nOn mix. So if you lose a dollar of construction, you lose a certain amount of revenue, you gain a dollar of mega construction, you gain a certain amount of revenue how does that shift out for you?\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThanks Rob, I'll take that. We're probably thinking more about, if you're thinking about what that larger customer, larger project, longer duration rental does from a mixed perspective. There's a bigger variance if you're thinking about this transactional business, so certainly our largest customers get a little bit of leverage out of their spend with us than Joe the plumber walking in the store. So that's where the biggest gap is, but one of the reasons why we built our go to market to make sure we specifically cater to these large customers, large projects and large plants is because when you could put those big block of revenues to work at one site, you could serve them much more efficiently. On the top line there may be some variance, certainly between your transactional business in the top line rate that you charge but margin-wise, we historically don't see much of a difference because of that lower cost to serve and that's why we've built this go to market to cater to those projects.\n\nRob Wertheimer - Founding Partner and Machinery Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSure Steve. I would call the handful--I think it's less than a handful, somewhere four or five projects that have hit the headlines--are really not relevant to the whole pipeline that we're tracking and I, to be fair, would say the same about new ones coming on. We do find out about new things coming on all the time, but the base is pretty robust and pretty well known quantity. And we've been tracking that number, that number remains strong at a steady level. When we think about the other, about the thing about these handful of projects, none of them are macroeconomic related, right. There are some delays that you would call political, maybe that there was a Chinese partner that one of the plants with dealing with that got some noise about others are permitting, there was a job in South Carolina that got delayed because some environmental potential issues that they have to work through so we're not seeing things that are slowed down because there's economic issues. It's really more just individual issues that are coming up for each of these projects. So not anything that we're concerned about, there is still a robust pipeline of jobs, many of which we have laid out today and many of which we know are coming out of the ground in 2024.\n\nI would call it more neutral, the egg's pretty well scrambled at this point other than some of the cleanup we're doing and certainly will be by year end when we when we lap the anniversary. As far as the synergies, we did a good job, we'll meet the synergies that we had guided towards in that we had targeted by year end, we're pretty close to done with them now. So we're in good shape there and it'll be nice to have a little bit cleaner view to share with you all, know more pro forma as reported. I know it's been confusing on some of the metrics specifically and all of that will be cleaned up by year end.\n\nSteven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nTerrific. Thank you very much.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSo usually we say as far as [inaudible] differentiation, right. So the asset attributes, which would be more of a fleet productivity, we'll get there next year somewhere around, but you have to remember it would be a like-for-like asset. They didn't have specialty, they didn't have some of the higher-valued items, but when you think about the assets that we bought from them, by next year we expect them to look--the performance to look like the assets that we own in that category. Now when you think about margin level, to get all of our processes implemented in their stores, it usually takes a little longer. Now you're talking somewhere between 18 months to two years depending on how fast we move, so there'll be a little bit of drag still on the operations of those stores as they implement all the new activity, the new tools, but from the fleet productivity it should be mostly realized on that shift.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nSo one thing I might add, and just for everybody's benefit, each deal certainly has its unique profile from a margin standpoint. Just for clarity's sake--we've talked about this pretty extensively--but the deals we do, tend to be margin-dilutive structurally. That's not to say they're not very good deals economically, the returns have clearly been very attractive, but if you think about Ahern, they were doing 35% EBITDA margins, LTM fully synergized, they were going to be sub 40. That was the same thing for Blue Line, I think, NDS fully synergized, they would've been 42. Neff was closer but certainly if you look at GSN, they were doing LTM, EBITDA margins of 27, they're in the low 30s synergized and the same thing was true with Ahern so we do do great job, we take pride in the fact that we're able to integrate these companies and extract a lot of value, including through cost synergies, but there has been that dynamic so I just--Clay I'm sure you appreciate that but for other people's benefit I just wanted to make sure we added that.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nYeah just, we've always been consistent in telling people don't anchor to midpoint and it's not kind of a give a wave or nod which direction you should be thinking, but we've given the range kind of where we feel comfortable indicating fourth quarter but beyond that we don't give quarterly guidance as you know.\n\nClay Williams - Equity Research Associate, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSure, Tim. So first off, that will always be our goal, to outpace inflation and we think we will. We feel confident we'll have positive fleet productivity and frankly, we need to outpace that inflation right. The whole point of fleet productivity was to make sure that we generate revenue growth higher than the fleet growth and that fleet growth, some of it's inflation, so you've got to exceed it. As far as the point and a half bogey that we put out there a couple of years ago, in reality, it's a little bit higher today where that extra inflation gets captured in mix, which gets captured in the fleet productivity report. So whether we change that bogey to higher, if we make that 2%-2.5% and then we add it back into the fleet productivity looks better--it's really just right pocket, left pocket. We're keeping it at one and a half for now, just for simplicity's sake. We're keeping it consistent but we still absorb that extra inflation and that comes in as negative mix. So you guys still see the whole picture and we'll probably continue to do that going forward. We talked about a little bit internally and we think it's easier to keep the metric consistent and we do expect to exceed that inflation, even with the extra mix headwind.\n\nTimothy Thein - Citigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nOkay, understood.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nAnd then hopefully, that makes sense.\n\nSure Tim. Well, it's certainly gotten better, right. So supply chain, certainly gotten better and I think you're seeing, I think you'll see most of the industry around more normalized time utilization and you've seen that this year and that's a good thing. Because it can run the business more efficiently and frankly, be more reliable partner to your customers. But I think the next big leg of growth, the OEMs still going to be replaced, I don't think that as OEMs grow their volume, this is going to be all this extra fleet in the system. There's still a lot of replacement CapEx that needs to be served and especially in some of the areas that's been dragging. So I think that'll be more the characteristic of the next year or two, we're getting ahead of the curve, you see how how much we're trying to focus on the used sales to get that fleet age right. So we feel good about where we are but we're still going to have a lot of replacement CapEx next year just like the rest of the industry.\n\nTimothy Thein - Citigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nOkay. Thanks for the time, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 at this time. Our next question comes from Neil Tyler with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nSure, Neil. Thanks for giving me the chance to clarify. Our cost synergies will be realized, you are absolutely right. Our revenue synergies will take longer so I--so knowledgeable of that, that I heard it as cost even if it wasn't asked that way, so thanks for that clarity. But the cross selling is going well and you know we're on schedule and that usually takes a couple of years to fully bake and we're on track for that. I think the customer base and the sales teams that come with that are very pleased to have a full portfolio to shop. So that's working well. And then as far as the used proceeds, yeah I mean, certainly we've talked about these dynamics for a while now and as the supply chain normalizes, the expectation would be that that incremental buyer, who couldn't buy new and is left to only buy used, fades. It's on a relative basis, you'll see not as much demand versus supply. That's something we've talked about and expected in '24 that's likely is going to be a dynamic that we should be looking for. On the other hand, you're still going to have fleet inflation and Matt alluded to kind of the cumulative 20%. That's for us, a very good position.\n\nI would say fleet inflation more broadly, it's higher and ultimately that provides an umbrella for used pricing. So these are the kind of cross-currents that we'll be balancing next year. We certainly would expect to have recovery rates well above historical levels. '22 set an unsustainable bar, I think everybody understood that there were some temporary benefit there that's led to us getting 74 cents on the dollar, if I'm not mistaken, selling eight-year old equipment. That's not normal and that's not something anybody ever expected to be sustained, you're seeing a normalization this year with that channel mix. Next year, I think you'll see us kind of normalize again, so ultimately those recovery rates they won't be at '22 levels, but they won't be back to those kind of pre-'20 levels either. The other part about fleet age, Neil, it won't be tremendously different. I mean, we still got--we just got back to more normalized fleet age. We've always had plenty of 8-year old equipment to sell so we don't think that that 7 to 8-year old average range that we've been hitting will be changing that much.\n\nNeil Tyler - Partner, Redburn Atlantic\n\nOkay. That's really helpful. Thank you.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nNeil, do you have a third question? I think you said you had three, I don't know two or [inaudible].\n\nNeil Tyler - Partner, Redburn Atlantic\n\nNo just that just the two of them.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nYeah, just generally yes. But I think you're talking about mostly the larger companies that are going to be supplying these jobs and we'll all mobilize the fleet to get there to take care of the customers, but generally it will tighten up in the surrounding areas. And then the other part of a lot of these plants, especially the ones that are built in more rural markets is you'll have infrastructure built around and whether that be feeder plants, whether that be residential and then the retail and the schools that go with it. So these are big boon for these markets overall, that we pick the whole, we certainly expect to get our fair share plus, but that's a whole area we'll benefit from.\n\nSteven Ramsey - Thompson Research Group, LLC\n\nThat's helpful. That's all for me thanks.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Weber with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSure, Seth. So if you go back to pre-COVID levels, we're usually about two thirds of our volume of retail and less than 5% auction and whatever fell in the middle there between trades and brokers varied a little bit on years, just based on what kind of negotiations with the vendors, what were the assets we needed to replace and so on. I think we expect it to be a bit more normalized in that type of atmosphere. Obviously, you saw 17% auction this past quarter, [inaudible] but tha'ts certainly a large number for us and that was just blowing out some of the older assets from the $2.2 billion of acquired fleet that we had through M&A, right. Everybody had their 5% to 10% in the back of the lot that you had decided to work through or get rid of it. So we just decided to clean that up but we will get back to more normalized channel mix that what you saw pre-pandemic.\n\nUnknown\n\nOkay. That's all I had, thank you guys.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nSo for my 30-plus years of doing this, anytime capital becomes more expensive, it's logical to think that people pay more attention to what they spend their capital on. So when you think about customers that were owning or wanted to own, it adds another barrier thought to them to then think about the opportunity to try rental. And once they do, the math just works. When you think about the lack of--even in a flat interest environment--when you think about once they get over the fact that 'can I get what I want when I need it' our industry has come such a long way that we don't lose customers. They don't go the other way after that because the rental experience is much better, they have flexibility to turn the assets too when they don't need them. They don't have to deal with all those soft costs of storage, maintaining, transportation and the reliability, right. So our mechanics are usually going to do a heck of a lot better job than somebody who is working on an equipment once in a blue moon. So all of those variables mean greater rental penetration and I think a higher interest environment just adds another layer of that higher penetration. So that's what would be our expectation, that's what history has taught us.\n\nMichael Feniger - Director of Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you. And my follow up is just, clearly there's some moving pieces for the construction cycle next year--offices, commercial versus infrastructure, industrial, upstream energy versus downstream--so help us in the context of fleet intensity. We saw this in 2015-16 with three years of the oil downturn. How much fleet would come out of some of these weaker pockets compared to the fleet necessary to service some of these other markets where there is some tailwind. So if you could just kind of help us conceptualize some of those moving pieces. Thank you.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nAnd Michael, pockets you're talking about, are you referring to what areas because we--I think you heard in my opening comments, we're seeing pretty broad-based demands; all the verticals that we serve, ironically other than oil and gas and I think we've all seen the rig count come down--has been were positive in Q3. So we're not seeing a lot of the soft pockets, say a little more what you're thinking about.\n\nOkay, great. So, we have always somewhere between $3 and $3.5 billion at our disposal to reposition fleet profiles, if that's what necessary. But one of the great things of the model is very fungible assets. The fleet we use may vary a little bit depending on what type of construction is going on, maybe in some of these stadiums you're going to need bigger booms and maybe on some of these megaprojects you're going to have a higher propensity for a full breadth of fleet, from more dirt-moving because they are bigger footprints. But our fleet breadth can really account for that and it's one of the great parts of the rental model--is as long as you don't get overly specialized, which we don't, that fungibility allows you to move it from different types of work to the other. And that's something that on the margin, if there's some changes, we certainly have just within our replacement CapEx, the opportunity to re-profile and send that fleet to the right place.\n\nTed Grace - CFO\n\nMike, what I might add--it's really difficult to get into demand intensity by sub-vertical, if you will--but the way we've kind of talked about this publicly when we look at it internally, is just more from a top-down perspective. If you think about the verticals where certainly, we feel very good things like manufacturing, power, infrastructure, transportation, healthcare, et cetera; if you look at the dollar value of those projects and those markets versus the areas you're alluding to, which maybe it's aspects of offices, aspects of commercial. The absolute dollars are much greater in the areas that seem to be opportunistic and so from a weighted basis, that's where we see our opportunity growing next year.\n\nMichael Feniger - Direct of Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. I will turn the call back to Matt Flannery for closing remarks.\n\nMatthew Flannery - CEO\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator. That wraps it up for today and I want to thank everyone for joining us and remind you all, if you have any questions, please feel free to read out reach out to Elizabeth anytime. Operator, you can now end the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation, you may disconnect at any time."

Speaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. As you've heard us say since the beginning of the year, 2023 is about raising the bar off of last year's record results our second quarter performance across growth, profitability and returns provides evidence of that. I'm pleased with how the year is playing out, including the Ahern integration, which remains on track. Of course, key to all of this is our employees who do an exceptional job supporting our customers every day. Without them, we wouldn't be able to generate the results we consistently deliver.\nAnd I'm pleased to report that once again, they've done this with safety at the forefront as our company-wide recordable rate remained well below one in the second quarter. Importantly, our growth shows that we continue to outpace our underlying markets as we leverage our competitive advantages to provide a superior level of customer service. So let's dig into the results. Total revenue rose by 28% year-on-year to a second quarter record of almost $3.6 billion. Within this, rental revenue grew 21% as reported with broad-based demand across verticals regions and customer segments, while fleet productivity increased 2.1% on a pro forma basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 29% to a second quarter record $1.7 billion driving solid margin expansion. Adjusted EPS grew by 26% to a second quarter record of $9.88. And critically, our return on invested capital set another new high watermark at 13.4%. In short, we're on track for another record year driven by robust customer activity. And the increases to our full year guidance reflects our continued confidence in customer demand. Used equipment sales were another highlight in the quarter. We generated a record second quarter proceeds of $382 million. The retail market remains very strong and we also broadened our channel mix as we discussed we would last quarter.\nCombined with the improvements we've seen across most of the supply chain, this has allowed us to refresh our fleet by rotating some of the older assets out. As you saw, rental CapEx totaled $1.25 billion in the quarter, in line with our expectations and helping to ensure that we have the capacity our customers need to support their projects today and going forward. And as I alluded to earlier, the integration of Ahern remains on track. The teams have come together especially well, and our second quarter results reflect the ongoing improvements in the efficiency of their business. And at this point, we're focused on optimizing the combined branch network and fleet, which should be completed by year-end. Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter demand.\nKey verticals saw broad-based growth led by industrial manufacturing, Metals & Minerals and Power. Nonres construction was also up double digits. Within this, our customers kicked off new projects across the board, including numerous EV plants and semiconductor plants, solar power facilities, infrastructure projects and for the Buffalo Bill fans out there, a new stadium. Geographically, we saw growth in all of our regions on both a reported and pro forma basis.\nAnd our specialty business delivered another excellent quarter with rental revenue up 17% year-on-year organically, and double-digit gains across all major categories. Within Specialty, we opened 19 new locations in the second quarter and are on track for the 40 cold starts this year. Turning to capital allocation. We returned over $350 million to shareholders during the quarter through share buybacks and dividends are on track to return over $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders this year. And our balance sheet remains in excellent shape.\nLooking ahead to 2020, 2023 is on track to be another record year across a variety of KPIs, including revenue, EBITDA, EPS and returns. We're encouraged by the customer sentiment and external indicators, which point to growth and give us confidence in our updated guidance. For example, the ABC's contractor Confidence Index remained strong across the second quarter as did its backlog index. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 19% year-over-year in June, while nonres construction employment growth also remains solid.\nAnd most importantly, our own customer confidence index continues to reflect their optimism. Beyond 2023, we remain positive on the longer-term outlook. Driven by key tailwinds, including infrastructure, industrial manufacturing and energy and power. As we shared at our Investor Day in May, we spent the last decade building unique and diverse capabilities that position us very well for the $2 trillion plus of construction projects underpinned by these tailwinds over the next decade.\nPut simply, our advantages across scale, complex solutions, technology and people put us in a first call position. And we believe this provides a platform for or leveraging our resilient business model and pursuing continued growth, both organically and through M&A. Finally, I want to highlight our new sustainability report, which we released yesterday. While there's a lot of great content in that report that we're very proud of. This year, I'd especially point out to the work our team has done quantifying how the rental business model aligns with key aspects of sustainability. For example, less equipment needs to be manufactured because of rental, which has clear benefits. While the equipment that we have in our fleet also helps our customers reduce their emissions intensity based on its younger age and greater fuel efficiency. And not only does this benefit our customers, we believe that it also benefits our employees, the communities we're operating in and our shareholders.\nBefore I hand the call over to Ted, I'll sum up today by saying I'm very pleased with how the year is playing out. We entered 2023 with high expectations. And as you can see through our results, that's what we're delivering. We feel good about the rest of the year and what's ahead for United Rentals and our investors. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted before we open the line for Q&A. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Grace\n\nVP of Investor Relations & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. As you saw in our second quarter release, our team produced strong results that were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track for another record year. And as we shared at our Investor Day, we continue to feel very good about our prospects beyond 2023 based on the tailwinds we've discussed extensively. One quick reminder before I jump into the numbers. As usual, the figures I'll be discussing are as reported, except where I call them at as pro forma, which are adjusted to include Ahern stand-alone results from last year. So with that said, let's get into the details.\nSecond quarter rental revenue was a record $2.98 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of $519 million or 21%, supported by diverse strength across our end markets. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $443 million or 22%. Our average fleet size increased by 25.5%, providing a $514 million benefit which was partially offset by a decline in as-reported fleet productivity of 2% or $41 million and our usual fleet inflation of 1.5% or $30 million.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $75 million or 19.3% and re-rent provided an additional $1 million. I'll note that on a pro forma basis, rental revenue was up a robust 12.4% year-over-year and fleet productivity increased 2.1% as industry discipline continues to support a healthy rate environment. Turning to used results. Our second quarter revenue increased 133% to $382 million as we continue to return to more normalized volumes while our second quarter adjusted used margin of 57.3% reflected healthy pricing.\nNotably, as we said we would, we've expanded our channel mix to support these higher used volumes. During the quarter, retail accounted for 65% of our mix, consistent with its longer-term proportion versus 90% last year. Within this shift, we doubled our retail volume and remains a very strong demand environment. Moving to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $1.7 billion, another second quarter record, reflecting an increase of $384 million or 29%. The dollar change includes a $310 million increase from rental within which OER contributed $298 million, ancillary added $15 million and re-rent was down $3 million. Outside of rental, used sales added $117 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $8 million.\nSG&A increased $51 million due primarily to increases in variable costs such as higher commissions. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&A declined 180 basis points year-on-year to a second quarter record low of 10.6% of total revenue, so nice efficiency there.\nLooking at second quarter profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points on an as-reported basis and increased 130 basis points on a pro forma basis to 47.7%. This translates to an as-reported flow-through of 49% and pro forma flow-through of better than 54%. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 26% to a second quarter record of $9.88. Shifting to CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $1.25 billion and net rental CapEx was $869 million. This represents an increase of $161 million in net CapEx And year-over-year, supporting our continued growth in 2023. Year-to-date, gross CapEx has totaled roughly $2.05 billion. This equates to about 60% of the midpoint of our full year rental CapEx guidance which is where we expected to be at this time of the year.\nTurning to return on invested capital and free cash flow, ROIC, which, as you know, is a critical metric for us to a new record at 13.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year and remains well above our weighted average cost of capital. Free cash flow also remains a good story with the quarter coming in at $340 million, or a trailing 12-month free cash margin of 12.3%, all while continuing to fund significant growth.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter improved to an all-time low of 1.8x or a decline of 10 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. And our liquidity at the end of June exceeded $2.7 billion with no long-term maturities until 2027. Notably, this was after returning $352 million to shareholders in the quarter including $250 million through share repurchases and $102 million via dividends.\nSo let's look forward and talk about our increased guidance, which reflects our continued confidence that 2023 will be a record year. Total revenue is now expected in the range of $14 billion to $14.3 billion, implying a $200 million increase in midpoint and full year growth of around 21.5% and pro forma growth of roughly 13.5%. Within total revenue, our used sales guidance is now implied at around $1.45 billion or an increase of $150 million, reflecting better-than-expected pricing and stronger-than-expected retail demand.\nWe've increased our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $100 million at midpoint to a range of $6.75 billion to $6.9 billion. This continues to imply as reported flow-through of around 48% and pro forma flow-through in the mid-50s. On the fleet side, we've narrowed our gross CapEx range by $50 million between $3.35 billion and $3.55 billion. Given the increase in our used sales expectations, this now implies net CapEx between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. And finally, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance by $175 million at midpoint to between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, which is before repurchases and dividends that together should return over $1.4 billion of cash to our investors or better than $20 per share. So with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident & COO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call.\nThree months ago, after our record full year financial performance in 2022, we told you that we'd continue raising the bar in 2023. And I'm pleased to say that the year is off to a strong start, which you can see in the results that we shared last night. The integration of Ahern is on track, and our team is doing a great job executing our plan and delivering for our customers. And as always, we're very pleased that we did this safely with another recordable rate below 1. This execution and the continued strength of our end markets give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year 2023 guidance for substantial growth, solid margin expansion and significant free cash generation.\nLet's start by digging into our first quarter results. Total revenue grew by 30% to a first quarter record $3.3 billion. Within this, rental revenue increased by 26%. EBITDA increased 32% to $1.5 billion, while margins expanded to 45.8%, both first quarter records. And finally, our return on invested capital set a new high watermark at 13.1%.\nDuring the first quarter, we invested $797 million in gross CapEx. And year-to-date, we've closed 2 local acquisitions that nicely complement our strategy. Combined with the actions that we took during the first quarter and fourth quarter of last year, we're well positioned to support the demand our customers see it.\nLooking more closely at the first quarter demand. Key verticals saw growth across the board, led by nonres construction, industrial manufacturing and power. Geographically, we saw much of the same, including double-digit growth in all of our regions.\nOur specialty business delivered another excellent quarter with rental revenue up 24% year-on-year and strong growth across all lines of business, led by our mobile storage team. Within specialty, we opened 6 new locations and are on track for around 40 cold starts this year.\nUsed sales were another positive in the quarter, with revenue up 84% year-on-year, largely due to the normalized volumes after holding back on sales in 2022. And not only were we see recovery rates and margins strong, but the level of demand provides another positive indication of how our customers are feeling about their outlook and the need for equipped.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our focus remains on driving profitable growth and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We view this as a hallmark of a good company and a means of maximizing value. During the quarter, we returned over $350 million to our shareholders, supported by the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we see continued reasons for optimism regarding our business in the balance of '23 and beyond. Near term, we're encouraged by the momentum we're carrying into our busy season, combined with a variety of positive industry indicators.\nFirst off, both internal and external measurements of customer confidence continue to point towards growth in 2023, and this is underpinned by current activity as well as the strength of customer backlogs. Additionally, nonres construction starts increased over 30% in March and the Dodge Momentum Index was up 24% year-over-year. And the ABI points to growth as well, where the forward-looking inquiries component continues in the right direction. Together, these factors support our reaffirmed full year 2023 guidance.\nLonger term, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on several significant multiyear tailwinds for our industry that we view as resilient in any economic environment. First is infrastructure. It remains early, but we continue to see a ramp in spending from the federal infrastructure bill across a variety of project types, including airports, bridges and road and highway. We're also well positioned to support our customers as they undertake projects across clean energy and advanced manufacturing funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.\nWithin private construction, we continue to see strong investments across manufacturing, led by autos, semiconductors and energy and power. Combined reports indicate that these tailwinds hold the potential for over $2 trillion of project spend in the U.S. over the next decade. We're very well positioned to leverage our competitive advantages on these projects. Whether through the size of our network or the breadth and depth of our products and services, our team is prepared to serve our customers and drive value creation for our shareholders.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to highlight some of the other significant achievements that team United had in the first quarter. And you've long heard us talk about doing well by doing good. And our team continues to be recognized for their efforts in this area, including recent wins from the Wall Street Journal, where we made their Management Top 250 list, recognizing companies for doing the right things well and the Just 100, which recognizes companies that are doing right by all their stakeholders while also generating strong performance for shareholders.\nSo to sum it up, we continue to feel good about 2023 and beyond as our long-term strategy has us well positioned. Our team is executing and our customers know we're there to support them with unmatched capabilities. And as we've consistently demonstrated, we know how to manage the flexibility of our business model while leveraging the strength of our balance sheet and the durability of our cash flow. And this gives us multiple options for creating value.\nAnd lastly, before I hand it over to Ted, I want to quickly highlight that we'll be hosting an Investor Day on May 31, during which we'll provide an in-depth review of our strategy, key initiatives and financial performance with a Q&A session to follow. The event will be held both virtually and in person in New York City, and we hope that you can join us.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Ted to review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Ted.\n\nWilliam Grace\n\nVP of Investor Relations & CFO\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our first quarter press release, our team again produced excellent results that were consistent with our expectations and importantly, position us well for the full year. And I think Matt framed things well in saying that we continue to feel good about both 2023 and beyond, given the market opportunity we see, our strategy, our team's consistently strong execution and our customers' knowledge that we are here to serve them with unmatched capabilities.\nOne quick note before I jump into the numbers. The figures I'll be discussing are as reported, except in a few instances where I'll call them out as pro forma, which are adjusted to include Ahern's first quarter 2022 stand-alone results in the year ago period.\nSo with that said, first quarter rental revenue was a record at $2.74 billion. That's an increase of $565 million or 26% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $469 million or 26.1%. Our average fleet size increased by 25.6%, providing a $460 million benefit and fleet productivity increased by 2% as reported, adding another $36 million. This was partially offset by our usual fleet inflation of 1.5% or $27 million.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $93 million or 28.3% and re-rent provided an additional $3 million or 6.1%. I'll note that on a pro forma basis, rental revenue is up a robust 16.6% and fleet productivity increased by a healthy 5.9%.\nFirst quarter used sales increased by 84% to $388 million as we return to a more normalized volume after holding on the fleet throughout much of 2022. Adjusted used margins increased by 170 basis points to 59.5%, supported by continued strong retail pricing.\nMoving to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter exceeded $1.5 billion, another first quarter record, reflecting an increase of $364 million or 32%. The dollar change includes a $313 million increase from rental, within which OER contributed $285 million. Ancillary added $29 million, and re-rent was down $1 million. Outside of rental, used sales added about $109 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $5 million.\nSG&A increased by $63 million due primarily to higher commissions and the continued normalization of certain discretionary costs. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&A declined by 120 basis points year-on-year to 11.6% of total revenue.\nLooking at first quarter profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points on an as-reported basis and 160 basis points on a pro forma basis to a first quarter record of 45.8%. This translates to 48% flow-through on an as-reported basis and better than 53% on a pro forma basis.\nAnd finally, adjusted EPS was $7.95, another first quarter record. That's a year-over-year increase of $2.22 per share or almost 39%.\nTurning to CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $797 million, and net rental CapEx was $409 million. This represents an increase of $138 million in net CapEx year-over-year and positions us well for the growth we see in 2023.\nLooking at return on invested capital and free cash flow, ROIC set a new record at 13.1% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 40 basis points sequentially and 220 basis points year-on-year. I'll add, that was 310 basis points above our current weighted average cost of capital. Free cash flow was another good story, with the quarter coming in at $478 million or an LTM free cash margin of 13.5%, all while continuing to fund significant growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter improved to 1.9x, representing a 10 basis point reduction both sequentially and year-over-year. And our liquidity at the end of March exceeded $2.65 billion with no long-term note maturities until 2027. Notably, all of this was after returning $353 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $103 million via dividends and $250 million through share repurchases.\nLooking forward, you saw last night that we reaffirmed our guidance across all metrics. Based on the diverse momentum we see across our markets and what we hear from our customers, we remain confident that 2023 will be a record year for the company.\nJust to review, Total revenue is expected in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.2 billion, implying full year growth of approximately 20% at midpoint and pro forma growth of 12%. Within total revenue, I'll remind you that our used guidance is implied at $1.3 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA range remains $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion. On an as-reported basis, at midpoint, this implies roughly flat full year adjusted EBITDA margins and flow-through of around 48%. The -- on a pro forma basis, however, which we think is the appropriate way to think about it, our guidance continues to imply about 80 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and flow through in the mid-50s. On the fleet side, our gross CapEx guidance remains $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, with net CapEx of $2 billion to $2.25 billion. And finally, our free cash guidance is $2.1 billion to $2.35 billion, which is before dividends, repurchases and bolt-on M&A.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please open the line."

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Yesterday, we reported record fourth quarter results that cap the best full year financial performance in our history. And we definitely raised the bar in '22, and we intend to raise it again in 2023. We're moving forward with a larger sales and service team, a more expansive footprint and a fleet that's significantly larger than a year ago, and that's a lot of tailwind at our back in another year of high demand. I'll start with a recap of fourth quarter results, which kept us on a strong trajectory. We grew both rental revenue and total revenue by a solid 19% compared with fourth quarter last year. And we grew adjusted EBITDA by 26% with a 280 basis point improvement in margin. That brought our margin to 50% in the quarter, and that came in at a very strong flow-through of 65%. We also continued to generate significant cash.\nFor the full year, we delivered $1.76 billion of free cash flow, and that's after investing over $3.4 billion in fleet. And none of this would have been possible without our people. First off, as you know, our top priority is always safety. And our team delivered another first-class recordable rate in '22 in a year when we onboarded over 6,000 new employees. On the financial side, you can look at every metric I just mentioned and see the quality of team united behind the result. For example, our revenue growth comes from keeping our customers front and center in the field. Our people are laser-focused on helping our customers succeed. And our flow-through comes from the team's ability to leverage our growth and maintain good cost discipline. Inflation was a factor, but that didn't stop us from delivering very good margins. We also reported a record return on invested capital of 12.7% at year-end.\nAnd on the ESG front, we made good progress with sustainability, including new investments in zero-emission vehicles and fleet. And the customer adoption of our new emissions tracking tool has been excellent. This is the technology we launched on our total control platform, and it's an industry first.\nAnother highlight of the quarter was the Ahern acquisition. And I'm pleased to say the integration is going very well. We closed the deal on December 7. And then by the 16th, our new team members were already operating with the rest of the company on the same technology system. And this means our branches are sharing fleet and customer information seamlessly. One of the main reasons we like M&A is the capacity we gain. And that comes in 3 forms: people, fleet and facilities. And we always focus on the people first because it's critical to get that right. And we're really bullish about the talent we onboarded in this acquisition.\nWe had over 100 of the Ahern managers at our Annual Meeting earlier this month, and they fit like a hand in glove. And they're excited to be part of United and they're raring to go. Now we're focused on optimizing the fleet and facilities. We're running on schedule, and it's boosting our resources at an ideal time to capture share. The diversity of demand that we pointed to a year ago turned out to be a major tailwind in our operating environment, and that continues to be true. And I'll share some fourth quarter data to underscore how we translated this opportunity into top line growth. Demand in our key verticals was broad-based, with total construction up 19% year-over-year and nonres up 22%; and industrial, up 11%.\nWe leaned into that opportunity across the board and grew rental revenue by solid double digits in all of our GenRent regions as well as all of our specialty businesses. Our Specialty segment delivered another strong performance with an 18% increase in rental revenue year-over-year. And it's notable that every line of business in that segment reported solid gain led by our mobile storage business. Our greenfield investments in specialty are highly strategic, and they're targeted by geography and line of business to generate attractive returns. We opened 35 of these locations in the past 12 months and our plan calls for at least another 40 cold starts in 2023.\nSo that brings us to 2023. There are plenty of reasons to feel confident about our operating environment. We have terrific internal and external momentum with good visibility into revenue. And the team has done a great job of driving strong fleet productivity to help offset the cost inflation we've experienced. Contractor backlogs are growing, and not surprisingly, the employment reports indicate that U.S. contractors continue to be in expansion mode. Industry indicators like Dodge Momentum Index show healthy growth trends in commercial construction, and this includes the planning trends for future projects.\nThere's also a strong institutional component to the trends, which we see in our business. And a number of our multiyear projects are in sectors like health care and education. And the industrial indicators like the PMI still have room for improvement, but the construction activity in manufacturing is going strong. We're winning business on a wide range of new plant construction, including automotive and batteries, semiconductors and petrochem. And importantly, our own survey shows that customer sentiment remains strong, with the majority of our customers pointing to growth over the next 12 months.\nOne final indicator of market strength and an important 1 was at our annual management meeting. We had over 2,000 field leaders with us in Houston 2 weeks ago, and their take was extremely positive. And I'm throwing that into the mix because this is coming directly from people on the front lines. We took all this into consideration when we developed our '23 guidance. And as you saw yesterday, we expect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA to hit new high watermarks, including free cash flow of more than $2.1 billion, while our return on invested capital should be another milestone for us. In addition to the capacity we carried into January, we plan to invest more than $3.4 billion in gross CapEx this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to take advantage of a strong used equipment market to optimize our fleet.\nLonger term, the outlook for our industry continues to be very favorable, driven by several tailwinds that we believe are largely independent of macro conditions. And we've talked about these before, things like infrastructure spending, the Inflation Reduction Act and the return of manufacturing to North America as well as investments in both energy and power.\nNow before I wrap up, I want to mention 2 important announcements we made yesterday regarding capital allocation. First off, we're reactivating the $1.25 billion share repurchase program that we paused when we announced the Ahern deal. We plan to buy back $1 billion of stock this year. And we'll also be instituting quarterly dividends for our shareholders, totaling $5.92 per share this year. These 2 decisions underscore our confidence in the durability of our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet. And together, they'll return $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023. So to come full circle, 2022 was a demand environment that through the door wide open for a record year, and we ran with it. But to quote Babe Ruth, we also know that yesterday's home runs don't win tomorrow's games. So now it's onwards and upwards.\n2023 is officially the start of the next quarter century in business for United Rentals and by all accounts, this will be another memorable year. So with that, I'll ask Ted to cover the results, and then we'll go to Q&A. Ted, over to you.\n\nWilliam Grace\n\nVP of IR & CFO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the results we reported last night, the team did a great job delivering across the board, both in the quarter and for the full year. And importantly, as you can see in our guidance, we expect these trends to continue in 2023. Combined with the enhancements to our capital allocation strategy that we've announced this quarter, we are confident that we will continue to drive meaningful long-term value creation for our shareholders. I'll dig into this more in a bit, but first, let's dive into the quarter.\nFourth quarter rental revenue was a record $2.74 billion. That's an increase of $435 million or nearly 19% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $354 million or 18.6%. Our fleet average -- our average fleet size increased by 14.2%, which provided a $270 million benefit to revenue and fleet productivity increased by a healthy 5.9%, which added another $113 million. This was partially offset by our usual fleet inflation of 1.5% or roughly $29 million. Also within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $81 million or 23.1% year-over-year. While re-rent was essentially flat.\nOutside of rental, fourth quarter used sales increased by roughly 26% to $409 million as we sold some fleet we've held back on selling earlier in the year. To help accomplish this, we broadened our channel mix for used sales in Q4 to something closer to normalized levels. The net of this was our adjusted used margins increased by 940 basis points year-over-year to 61.6% supported by strong pricing.\nLet's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.65 billion, another record and an increase of $338 million or 25.8% year-on-year. The dollar change included a $291 million increase from rental within which OER contributed $256 million. Ancillary added $34 million and re-rent was up $1 million. Outside of rental, used sales added about $83 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $18 million. SG&A was a $54 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA due primarily to higher commissions and the continued normalization of certain discretionary costs. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&A was down slightly year-over-year.\nLooking at fourth quarter profitability, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 280 basis points to 50.0%. Excluding the benefit of used sales, flow-through was in line with recent quarters at a healthy 59%. I'll add that within the fourth quarter results, in the roughly 3 weeks we owned Ahern, the business contributed about $54 million of total revenue, the vast majority of which was rental and roughly $20 million of EBITDA.\nAnd finally, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $9.74 per share. That's an increase of $2.35 per share or almost 32% year-on-year.\nTurning to CapEx. Fourth quarter gross rental CapEx was $980 million, and net rental CapEx was $571 million. This represents an increase of $205 million in net CapEx year-over-year, which positions us well for the growth we see in 2023. Now let's look at return on invested capital and free cash flow. ROIC was another highlight at a record 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 50 basis points sequentially and an increase of 240 basis points year-on-year. Free cash flow also continues to be very strong, with the year coming in at $1.76 billion or a free cash margin of better than 15%, all while continuing to fund growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.0x on an as-reported basis, including the impact of the Ahern acquisition. More importantly, on a pro forma basis, our year-end leverage ratio was flat sequentially at 1.9x.\nAnd finally, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very robust $2.9 billion with no long-term note maturities until 2027.\nNow let's look forward and talk about our 2023 guidance. Total revenue is expected in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.2 billion, implying full year growth of about 20% at midpoint and pro forma growth of roughly 12%. This increase is supported by the momentum we've carried into the New Year, particularly within rental revenue and the contribution from Ahern. Within total revenue, I'll note that our used sales guidance is implied at $1.3 billion, with the expectation that we'll sell roughly $2 billion of OEC.\nThis 35% increase in used sales year-over-year primarily reflects 2 things. First, is the normalization of our used sales as the supply chain continues to improve. And second, a substantially larger fleet, including the addition of Ahern to our business. We remain focused on efficiently converting this growth to our bottom line.\nOur adjusted EBITDA range is $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion. On an as-reported basis, including the impact of Ahern, at midpoint, this implies roughly flat full year adjusted EBITDA margins and flow-through of about 48%. On a pro forma basis, however, which we think is the more appropriate way to think about it, our guidance would imply at roughly 80 basis points of margin expansion and flow through in the mid-50s. On the fleet side, our initial gross CapEx guidance is $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, with net CapEx of $2 billion to $2.25 billion.\nAnd finally, our free cash guidance is $2.1 billion to $2.35 billion. To be clear, this is before dividends and repurchases. Assuming these 2 factors are a use of cash of roughly $1.4 billion that leaves $825 million of remaining free cash flow to fund additional growth or reduce net debt.\nNow before we go to Q&A, I want to make some additional comments on our updated capital allocation strategy. Specifically around our plans to return excess cash to our investors. As you heard Matt say, we are very pleased to be adding a dividend program to our mix. Based on an initial yield of 1.5%, we expect to pay $5.92 in dividends per share in 2023. This will translate to approximately $400 million this year or roughly 18% of free cash flow. We expect that our first quarterly dividend payment of $1.48 will be made on February 22, with all 4 payments expected within the calendar year.\nFollowing the transformation of the company over the last decade or so, we feel that it's the appropriate time to add this last element to our capital return strategy to help drive greater shareholder value. Not only will this help expand the universe of potential investors, we expect that it will also provide another means of enhancing total returns for our investors over time. It also reflects the confidence we have in our operating model to consistently generate considerable excess free cash flow after investing in growth.\nWe're also very pleased to announce the restart of our share repurchase program, which we paused in November with the announcement of Ahern. The restart is probably a bit ahead of schedule, but the integration is off to a great start and the decision is well supported by the financial performance we expect this year. It's our intention to repurchase $1 billion of the $1.25 billion authorization in calendar 2023. As Matt said, these 2 programs combined, should return approximately $1.4 billion to our shareholders this year or about $20 per share at the same time that we continue to see substantial growth in our earnings.\nFinally, I want to be clear that these announcements are being made in the context of our continued commitment to a disciplined balance sheet strategy. Our financial strength has served the company and its shareholders very well, and we're not planning any changes there. So with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator, could you please open the line?"

Please refer back to the company's recent investor presentation to see the reconciliation for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSpeaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Interim Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery , you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call.\nWell, the team has made my job pretty easy today. We reported another strong quarter in a positive operating environment in a record year. That's a great trifecta. And I know it sounds familiar because that's how the year has been going. This quarter was especially gratifying. We delivered year-over-year increase in rental revenue of 20% with fleet productivity of almost 9%. Our people were definitely on top of that opportunity.\nWe achieved good operating leverage in our business by working efficiently. And that's not easy to maintain during peak demand, especially in the current cost environment. So I applaud the team for meeting our customers' needs while staying mindful of profitability and most of all, we are doing it safely.\nOur recordable rate for both the third quarter and year-to-date were well below 1, and that's with about 10% more headcount in the quarter versus last year. Against this backdrop, we grew our EBITDA margin by 240 basis points year-over-year to 49.9% in the quarter as we grew EBITDA dollars faster than revenue to over $1.5 billion. That's a record for us in any quarter, and flow-through was a very solid 63%. Importantly, we also delivered another improvement in return on invested capital to a record 12.2%.\nGiven these results and the momentum we're seeing, we raised our full year 2022 guidance for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA as well as rental CapEx. I want to elaborate on the CapEx point before I move to our customers and our end markets. Our industry has continued to show good discipline in terms of supply and demand, which creates a healthy environment for attractive returns.\nWe have 2 levers we can pull to capitalize on this demand. First, we intentionally held back on used equipment sales this year to make sure we had enough capacity for our customers. And even though we sold less fleet in the quarter on an OEC basis versus our original plan, our revenue from used sales in Q3 was essentially flat year-over-year, supported by very strong pricing. And secondly, we had the opportunity to pull forward some CapEx into the current quarter to ensure that we're set up for a strong start to 2023. Our updated guidance includes an increase of rental CapEx of about $350 million at the midpoint. And we think this is prudent as our OEM partners continue to work through supply chain challenges.\nSo that's how we're thinking about CapEx at United Rentals. And on a related note, we're continuing to invest some of the CapEx and fleet that lowers carbon emissions on job sites, in line with our ESG initiatives. We recently announced an agreement to purchase all electric ride-on dumpsters from JCB, making us the first equipment rental provider to offer this product in our fleet. And on the innovation front, we just launched a sustainability tool in our total control platform that tracks greenhouse gas emissions data. This technology is an industry-first, and it's a good example of how we differentiate our company as a partner beyond the transaction. And in this case, we're helping customers reach their own sustainability goals. Investments like these continue to add value to our offering and keep us growing faster than the industry.\nNow I'll turn to the macro. While there are portions of the economy that are clearly slowing, in our industry, customer activity is still on the upswing and demand for our equipment rental continues to be very strong. Customer sentiment and key industry indicators remain positive. And we know this outlook may seem at odds with some views on the broader economy.\nAnd if we saw a cause for concern in our markets, we'd be standing here talking about it. We'd also be using the flexibility built into our model to pivot to a more conservative stance. Instead, we're investing in the tangible opportunities that we see ahead.\nHere are a few of the unique dynamics that should help our industry continue to outpace the macro in virtually any economic cycle. One is a $550 billion of funding in the U.S. infrastructure bill, which will finally put shells in the ground starting in '23. This should trigger at least 5 years of opportunity. There's another $440 billion of federal tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy and plant upgrades. And we think these will have a 5- to 10-year impact.\nAnd in the manufacturing sector, there are multiple tailwinds that will play out on different time lines. This year alone, hundreds of billions of dollars of new investment in manufacturing have been announced. Investments are already underway in automotive electrification, microchip factories and the broader trend towards onshoring. And there's also more focus on energy production to serve markets in North America and Europe. Many of these tailwinds are new to the construction and industrial sectors. And in combination, they're a major opportunity for our industry.\nLooking specifically at our business, the quarter played out even better than we anticipated. Both of our segments in every one of our regions grew rental revenue year-over-year by double digits. Rental revenue from non-resi construction was up 24%, infrastructure was up 11% and industrial was up 13%. And these are all consistent with the trends we've seen in recent quarters. Demand for specialty was strong across the segment with rental revenue up 23% year-over-year as a whole, led by our Mobile Storage and Fluid Solutions businesses.\nOur greenfield plans for specialty are moving forward with 25 cold starts opened through September and another 11 planned by year-end. Cold starts continue to be a valuable growth strategy for specialty with a long-term benefit to our company's total performance.\nLooking at our markets by vertical, the big multiyear projects in Q3 continue to be data centers, distribution centers and renewables as well as the automotive and ship plants that I mentioned earlier. Now these projects span multiple regions and most of them are mega projects where our customer base, our technology and our position as a one-stop shop give us a major competitive advantage.\nContractors are managing to source the labor and the materials they need, but at the same time, they're dealing with cost inflation. So they need to squeeze more productivity out of every dollar. And we have the digital solutions to help our customers get more utilization from the equipment they rent and own.\nWork sites are evolving into connected environments, and we're positioned as a leader in that space, and our customers assign real value to the data that we provide. And lastly, I want to mention the new share repurchase authorization we announced yesterday. This program will return $1.25 billion of excess capital to our investors by the end of 2023. And we're proud to make this additional commitment to supporting shareholder value.\nSo in conclusion, our 25th year in business is also shaping up to be a record year of financial performance. We've got a great team in place, and we'll continue to explore every avenue for growth and returns. The construction and industrial sectors we serve had their own tailwinds, driving the historic demand for our services. Our customers are building a strong book of business for 2023 and the secular shift towards renting and expanding the market.\nIn this environment, we'll continue to be good stewards of United Rentals. We'll focus on profitable growth as we have all year, and we'll remain flexible to act in the best interest of our shareholders.\nAnd with that, Ted, it's over to you.\n\nWilliam Grace\n\nVP of IR & Interim CFO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning, everybody.\nAs you saw in the results we reported last night, the team did a great job delivering across the board. We continue to take advantage of the market by supporting our customers with the fleet they need, driving healthy productivity and converting that growth to our bottom line. This performance, combined with our updated outlook for the remainder of the year, is reflected in our new guidance, which I'll touch on later.\nBut first, let's dive into the quarter. Rental revenue was a record $2.73 billion. That's up $455 million or 20% year-over-year, with strong contribution from both general rental and specialty. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $341 million or 18%. Our average fleet size increased by 10.6%, which provided a $201 million benefit to revenue, while fleet productivity increased a healthy 8.9%, adding $168 million. This was partially offset by our usual fleet inflation of about 1.5 points or roughly $28 million.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $103 million or 32%. This is due mainly to increased delivery fees and other pass-through charges. And finally, re-rent increased $11 million.\nOutside of rental, third quarter used sales were essentially flat at $181 million as we intentionally held on to fleet to ensure we could support stronger-than-expected rental demand in our peak season. The vast majority of these sales were in the high-margin retail channel. This, together with improved pricing, helped deliver a very healthy 64.6% adjusted use margin for the quarter and record proceeds as a percent of OEC of 83%.\nLet's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.52 billion, another record and an increase of $288 million or 23.4% year-on-year. The dollar change includes a $288 million increase from rental, within which OER contributed $245 million, ancillary contributed $37 million and re-rent contributed $6 million. Outside of rental, used sales added about $25 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $3 million.\nSG&A increased $28 million, primarily due to higher commissions related to volume and the normalization of certain discretionary costs. As a percent of revenue, however, SG&A showed good leverage declining 90 basis points to 11.7% of sales.\nLooking at third quarter profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 240 basis points to 49.9%, implying very healthy flow-through of around 63%. Excluding the benefit of used sales, flow-through was a still solid 58% supported by robust rental growth, good fleet productivity and vigilant cost management. And finally, third quarter adjusted EPS was a record at $9.27. That's an increase of $2.69 per share or almost 41% year-on-year.\nTurning to CapEx. Third quarter gross rental CapEx of $1.1 billion and net rental CapEx of $921 million were both in line with year-ago levels.\nNow let's look at return on invested capital and free cash flow. As Matt mentioned, ROIC was another highlight of the quarter at a record 12.2% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 70 basis points sequentially and an increase of 270 basis points year-on-year. Free cash flow also continues to be very strong with $176 million generated in the quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and over $1.1 billion generated through the first 9 months of the year, all while continuing to fund growth.\nFlipping to the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio declined 10 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points year-on-year to 1.9x its lowest level in our history. Additionally, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very robust $2.8 billion with no long-term note maturities until 2027. Combined with our cash generation, this provides us with tremendous strength and flexibility to run the company and support shareholder value in any environment.\nNow let's look forward and talk about our updated guidance for the year. Total revenue is now expected in the range of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, or an increase of $50 million at midpoint and implying full year growth of better than 19%. This increase is supported by the momentum we've seen across our business, particularly within rental revenue that we expect to carry into next year.\nWithin total revenue, I'll note that we've reduced our used sales guidance by $50 million to $1 billion. As part of this change, we now expect to sell between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of OEC. As evident in our updated guidance, we remain focused on efficiently converting that additional rental revenue to the bottom line.\nOur adjusted EBITDA range is now $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which at midpoint to $75 million above the midpoint of our prior guidance. This implies a roughly 240 basis point increase in full year adjusted EBITDA margins and flow-through of about 60%.\nAs Matt highlighted, we have also revised our outlook for gross CapEx by $350 million as we land delayed orders placed earlier in the year in select high-demand cat classes. In total, we now expect gross CapEx of between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion. With these changes, we still expect to generate a very healthy $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion of free cash flow translating to a free cash margin of around 15%.\nNow before we go to Q&A, I'll finish with a few comments on our new share repurchase authorization. We view the $1.25 billion program as an indication of our confidence in our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the durability of our cash generation. And we're proud of the fact that we've already returned $5 billion of excess capital to our investors since 2012 to support shareholder value while simultaneously getting our balance sheet to its strongest position in our 25 years.\nSo with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator, could you please open the line?"

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.\nBefore we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control. And consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.\nA summary of these uncertainties is included in the safe harbor statement contained in the company's press release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.unitedrentals.com.\nPlease note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.\nYou should also note that the company's press release and today's call include references to non-GAAP terms, such as free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the back of the company's recent investor presentation to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nSpeaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jessica Graziano, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call.\nI'll start with the main takeaways from yesterday's release. In the second quarter, our team executed extremely well in a robust demand environment. And as a result, we delivered very strong performance by any measure.\nOur rental revenue increased by 26% year-over-year to a second quarter record of almost $2.5 billion, well above expectations, and adjusted EBITDA grew faster than the top line, up 31% to a record $1.3 billion.\nWe also demonstrated good cost discipline. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 360 basis points to 47.3%. This contributed to a strong flow-through of about 65%. And importantly, we delivered a 230 basis point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 11.5%.\nThe 3 tailwinds we saw at the start of the year continued to fuel our momentum. The macro environment remained favorable, which created more demand in the quarter, and you could see that in our rental revenue growth, which included fleet productivity of better than 11%.\nIn addition, the customer trend toward renting equipment is alive and well. We see this as a secular shift that will continue to move the market from owning equipment to renting it over time.\nAnd lastly, we're confident that our growth is outpacing our industry as we continue to take share, both in our core markets and with key customers.\nOne reason we're gaining share is our positioning as a one-stop shop. Customers place a lot of value on being productive. And our combination of scale, job site solutions, superior service and technology is unique in our industry. Customers also care about safety, and we prioritize safety on and off the job site. And this is another area where our team delivered in Q2 by keeping our recordable rate well below 1.\nAnd increasingly, customers place a value on sustainability. In May, we announced an initial agreement to purchase over 500 all-electric trucks and vans from Ford, including the F-150 Lightning pickups. Now this partnership is a good example of how we're continuing to add sustainable solutions to our rental fleet, while moving toward greener operations.\nWe're proud of the progress we're making in many different areas of ESG, including environmental stewardship and social impact. Yesterday, we released our 10th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report with comprehensive data covering 2021, along with more recent developments. You can find it on our website if you'd like to download it.\nAnother thing customers strongly care about is reliability. It's high on their list, and we've got a very high bar in response. Our team is trained to deliver a caliber of service that earns the next opportunity. And our employees like that challenge, and they love being an arrow to our customers.\nThat's a big part of our culture at United, and it helps with retention and recruitment. Our net headcount at the end of June was 9% higher than a year ago, which is a solid gain in a tight labor market.\nNow I'll repeat something I said before, we're fortunate to have a world-class team standing behind our strategy. It gives us confidence in every target we put out there, and that includes the updated guidance we released yesterday, which raised our outlook for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nWe have strong visibility through the balance of the year, and the activity we're seeing will create a lot of demand to get equipment on rent. There are plenty of positive signs to support this view. Virtually, all of the external indicators are favorable, including the Dodge Momentum Index, the ABI, contractor backlogs and customer sentiment.\nAnd the used equipment market remains robust. In the second quarter, we captured record recovery rates and margins on used sales. And I spoke to all of these dynamics coming out of Q1, and they're all still true today.\nNow I'm going to pivot to look at demand at the ground level. Our gen rent and specialty segments both performed extremely well in the quarter. All of our regions company-wide delivered double-digit rental revenue growth. And in many ways, it's a continuation of what we spoke about in Q1, broad-based activity across regions, stemming from a diversified mix of end markets and key verticals.\nLooking at it by end market. Our rental revenue from non-res construction was up 27% year-over-year, and infrastructure was up 15%. And more broadly, almost every vertical showed year-over-year growth in rental revenue.\nIn terms of project types, large data centers are continuing to break ground, along with infrastructure projects and distribution centers, and manufacturing is coming back. The power vertical is also accelerating, and there are more tailwinds in the wings.\nWith infrastructure, for example, the funding is now finalized in Washington, and we expect to start seeing a benefit in 2023 and beyond. With manufacturing, the resurgence of the industrial sector in North America is being driven in part by supply chain challenges in other parts of the world, and that's good for us.\nIt's already evident in certain sectors. Companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in mega projects in the U.S. and Canada to build plants across a variety of verticals, like semiconductors and automotive. These projects will require equipment for years to come, and they play to our competitive advantage with large customers.\nOn the specialty side, the segment had another excellent quarter led by our power and mobile storage businesses. The segment as a whole grew rental revenue by 39%, including the benefit from General Finance. Pro forma, specialty was up a strong 29%.\nWe opened 24 cold storage through June in specialty against a revised target of about 45 openings by year-end, and that's slightly higher than our original projection of 40 openings this year.\nSo as you can see, 2022 continues to be a landmark year for our company, both financially and operationally. We delivered another record quarter in what we expect to be a record year. Our flow-through in the quarter reflects the team's discipline in navigating a challenging cost environment. And we continue to have the benefit of a strong balance sheet, low leverage and robust cash generation. This gives us the flexibility to act opportunistically on many fronts.\nThis year, we expect to make the largest investment in our history in fleet of about $3 billion, and our suppliers are taking good care of us, and our CapEx spend is tracking to plan. We'll also continue to explore growth through cold starts and acquisitions. We've made 7 bolt-on acquisitions this year to date for a total consideration of over $300 million. Lastly, we expect to complete our share repurchase authorization this quarter.\nThese are all prudent capital allocations to create long-term shareholder value. And we know that the key to leveraging capital is relentless execution, and that's what you're seeing from us in our results.\nNow before I hand it over to Jessica, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank her personally for her many contributions over the past 7 years. As you all know, Jess will be leaving us to take on a new opportunity, and Ted has stepped in as we go through the CFO search process. And I know I speak for our entire leadership team when I say it's been a pleasure to work with Jess, and we wish her all the best in her new endeavor.\nAnd now with that, Jess, you've got floor.\n\nJessica T. Graziano\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Matt, for your kind words. It's definitely bittersweet to be on my last earnings call for United. My time here has been an incredible experience and not just with our amazing Team United and our Board, but also working so closely with Ted and the investment community. We've accomplished a lot together, so I'm grateful to have this chance to publicly say thank you.\nAs we look to the quarter, I'm especially pleased to be able to report such great results on my last call, record results actually. As Matt shared, the strength we've seen in demand across our end markets has exceeded our expectations for the quarter. It also underpins our increased guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the full year, and more on that later.\nLet's start with a closer look at the second quarter. Rental revenue for the second quarter was a record $2.46 billion. That's up $511 million or 26.2% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $383 million or about 23%.\nOur average fleet size increased by 13.6%, which provided a $223 million tailwind to revenue. Fleet productivity was up a very healthy 11.3%, contributing $185 million. And rounding out OER was about a $25 million reduction in rental revenue from fleet inflation, which we estimate to be a 1.5% drag.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were higher by about $115 million or 42%, which is mainly due to increased delivery fees and other pass-through charges. And finally, re-rent was up $13 million in the quarter.\nUsed sales for the quarter were $164 million, a decline of $30 million, or about 15% from the second quarter last year. We continue to manage used sales to help ensure we have adequate capacity to serve the robust demand we're seeing this year. We're focusing those sales in our most profitable retail channel and, together with a strong market overall and better pricing, delivered a healthy 62.2% adjusted used margin for the quarter. That represents sequential improvement of about 440 basis points and year-over-year improvement of just over 1,400 basis points.\nLet's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.31 billion, another record for us, and an increase of 31.2% year-over-year or $312 million. The dollar change includes a $324 million increase from rental. Now in that, OER contributed $273 million, and ancillary was up $51 million.\nUsed sales were a tailwind to adjusted EBITDA of $9 million, and other non-rental lines of business provided $10 million. Other income also contributed $10 million of year-on-year benefit, in part due to some of the onetime costs from acquisitions we called out in the second quarter of last year.\nSG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $41 million driven in large part by higher commissions on higher revenue. And as expected, we saw certain discretionary costs in SG&A continue to normalize.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin came in very strong at 47.3%, up 360 basis points year-over-year, with excellent flow-through of 64.5%. And excluding the benefit from used sales in the quarter, flow-through would have been a healthy 59%.\nThe strong performance across the core business reflects better-than-expected growth in rental. It also reflects the impact of actions we've taken to pass through cost inflation in certain areas like delivery and fuel. Our team also did a great job managing costs across other areas of the business.\nLet's shift to adjusted EPS, which was another record for us at $7.86, that's up 68% or $3.66 versus last year. EPS this quarter includes about $0.55 from a onetime tax benefit. But even if we adjust for that benefit, I'm pleased to note our EPS would still have been a record this quarter.\nLooking at CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was a healthy $872 million in the second quarter. Proceeds from used equipment sales were $164 million, resulting in net CapEx of $708 million, which was similar to the second quarter last year. Net CapEx for the first half of the year of $979 million is up $232 million or 31%.\nNow turning to ROIC and free cash flow. ROIC continues to run well above our weighted average cost of capital at a record 11.5% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 60 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year-over-year.\nFree cash flow also continues to be very strong, as we generated $392 million in the second quarter and just under $1 billion for the first half of the year, all while continuing to invest in high levels of CapEx to grow our business.\nI'll share a few comments on our balance sheet. As I look back on my time here, I am especially proud of the work our team has done on the balance sheet. It is in fantastic shape. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter remains at the lowest level in our history at 2.0x. That's flat sequentially and down 50 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong $2.8 billion, with the vast majority of that coming from ABL capacity of just over $2.5 billion.\nAnd notably, within the quarter, we took a number of actions to further bolster our positioning, including upsizing and extending both our ABL and AR facilities with improved terms. And I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that our next long-term note maturity isn't until 2027.\nThe last thing I'll mention on our capital allocation relates to our current $1 billion share repurchase program. We leaned in a bit into the execution, acquiring roughly $500 million in shares during the second quarter. Through June 30, we've spent $762 million of the authorization, repurchasing a little more than 3.5% of our fully diluted share count. With $238 million left to purchase, we expect we'll finish this program in the third quarter.\nLet's look forward and talk about our updated guidance for 2022, which we shared in our press release last night. Total revenue is now expected in the range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, or an increase of $250 million at the midpoint, implying full year growth of 18.9%.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this increase is supported by robust demand that we continue to see broadly across our geographies and our end markets. We expect the profitability and flow-through on that higher revenue to remain strong.\nOur adjusted EBITDA range is now $5.4 billion to $5.55 billion, up $175 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance. This implies a 200 basis point increase in full year adjusted EBITDA margin and robust full year flow-through of about 58%.\nOur range for gross and net CapEx is unchanged. We still expect to source about $3 billion of gross CapEx. We also expect the strength of the used equipment market will support used proceeds, consistent with our original guidance even though we'll sell less fleet for the full year than originally planned.\nAnd finally, our free cash flow guidance has increased $150 million at the midpoint, as we now look to generate between $1.85 billion and $2.05 billion. That's mainly from higher operating profit we expect to deliver this year.\nNow as I pass the baton, I've asked Ted to jump in on Q&A. So let's get to your questions. Operator, please open the line."

Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I want to frame my comments today around one word, demand. 2022 is shaping up to be a year of record demand for our services, and this is the driving force behind the strong first quarter results we reported, and it underpins our decision to update our guidance.\nAs you saw yesterday, we now expect our total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be above our original outlook. This reflects the positive impact of the new cycle we talked about in January, and we're excited to continue that conversation today.\nI'll start with some highlights in the quarter. It became clear that this was not typical seasonality. Our rental revenue tends to be down from Q4 to Q1 as winter section, and that's true for the industry as well. But this year, we saw only about half of that normal decline. And as you may recall, we brought in more fleet than usual at the end of last year, and that capacity helped us to capitalize on demand and deliver strong results in key metrics.\nOur first quarter rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increased by 31% year-over-year to record levels, and we improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points to 45%. This gave us a strong flow-through of 57% for the quarter. And we also drove a 200 basis point improvement in return on invested capital to 10.9%.\nAnd while the numbers speak for themselves, it's the drivers behind the numbers that we want to focus on today. First, the underlying macroeconomic growth, which continues to move in the right direction. Also, the sustained rebound in many of our end markets coming out of COVID. And lastly, rental penetration in the construction and industrial sectors. We expect all 3 tailwinds to continue for the foreseeable future.\nWe're also confident that we're gaining share with key customers as we leverage our ability to solve their problems. This is the best way to further differentiate United Rentals in the customer's eyes. And importantly, we see runway here as well.\nAnd there's a future tailwind emerging from the infrastructure legislation. We're starting to have conversations with customers about federal projects that should kick off in 2023. And it's a diverse mix with projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports, and also on the power grid.\nI also want to call attention to something that may not be so apparent on the surface, which is just how good our team is at managing growth. When demand ramps up in our business, it requires a tremendous amount of operating discipline, especially with customer service. We're very fortunate to have a world-class team standing behind our strategy.\nThere's tangible value to this, and we set the company up to be opportunistic, and our people excel at execution. I'll give you some quick examples. The first quarter gave us a big lever for growth, with demand running above seasonality. We have the right people and the right fleet in place to pull that lever. And as a result, we achieved a 13% year-over-year increase in fleet productivity, with strong incremental flow-through to the bottom line. The team also excelled at safety, keeping our recordable rate below 1 for the quarter while safely onboarding and training over 1,400 new employees.\nOn the ESG front, we made headway on a number of initiatives. For example, in March, we added power bank systems to our fleet. These lithium battery packs have 0 emissions and replaced some of the diesel fuel used by generators.\nThe OEMs are beginning to move faster with R&D, which should make hybrid and electrical solutions more viable on job sites, and we welcome that because we're firmly committed to a sustainable future that makes sense for our customers. So stay tuned for more updates on that going forward.\nTo flesh out the backdrop for everything I just described, our operating environment is, in many ways, the same positive broad-based outlook we shared with you in January, but with an extra layer of visibility. Our line of sight for the balance of '22 has improved based on what we saw in Q1, including the number of projects underway, with solid backlogs and the level of customer bid activity. Not surprisingly, our customer confidence index improved as well, and the underlying data supports it. All of our regions had significant double-digit increase in rental revenue. In fact, year-over-year growth in the first quarter outpaced the growth we saw in Q4.\nAnother positive indicator is the continued strength in the pricing environment for used equipment. When we made a strategic decision to sell less equipment in the quarter relative to our initial plans to make sure we could take care of the customers in the robust demand we were seeing. But when you look at what we did sell, our OEC recovery levels improved from the fourth quarter, and our used margins set a new record.\nMore broadly, the data on construction starts and backlogs, the ABI and the Dodge Momentum Index all remain positive. In fact, it's hard to find a leading construction indicator that isn't (inaudible) green right now. We factored all of this into our guidance, along with some projected headwinds like inflation.\nWe're not immune to the challenges in the macro, but we mitigated the impact of inflation in Q1, and we're confident that we'll continue to manage through any challenges successfully. So that's the big picture.\nAnd I'll round it out with some details at the market level. In the first quarter, our rental revenue from non-res construction was up 28% year-over-year, and infrastructure was up 17%. Industrial also trended up, with 13% year-over-year growth. And that 13% growth is encouraging because industrial was on its way to recovery before the pandemic hit. Once the supply chain is sorted out, we expect that industrial like infrastructure will be another sizable runway for us beyond 2022.\nOur specialty segment had another excellent quarter, led by our power business. Every specialty line delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in rental revenue, and the segment as a whole grew almost 48%, including the benefit from General Finance. It's been 11 months since we completed that acquisition, and the mobile storage and modular office business is clicked right into place. We've given these specialty businesses more resources, and they're cross-selling ahead of schedule. This has all the hallmarks of a home run for our customers.\nWhen we said at the time we closed that deal that we wanted the double size of that business in 5 years while 11 months in, we're firmly on track to make that happen. Additionally, in specialty, we opened 13 cold starts in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter towards our target of about 40 cold starts this year.\nSo to sum it up, I've conveyed the scope of the market opportunity going forward and our competitive position to capture that growth. The prevailing trends that matter to our business are market-driven, and our markets are healthy. It's why we've been bullish about this year from day 1 and why we raised our guidance when demand continued to track above our initial forecast.\n2022 is off to a very strong start with all the makings of a year of record results.\nNow Jess will go over those results, and then we'll go to Q&A. Jess, over to you.\n\nJessica T. Graziano\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll build on Matt's comments by saying we are very pleased to have delivered record first quarter results across virtually every financial metric. That momentum carrying into the second quarter, along with strong customer confidence and our increasing visibility, supports the raise to our 2022 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nI'll share more on our updated guidance in a bit. Let's start with a closer look at the results for the first quarter. Rental revenue for the first quarter was a record $2.18 billion. That's up $508 million or 30.5% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $392 million or about 28%. Our average fleet size was up 16.4%, which provided a $231 million tailwind to revenue. Fleet productivity was better by a healthy 13%, contributing $183 million, and fleet inflation of 1.5% was a drag on revenue of $22 million and rounds out the change in OER.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were higher by about $99 million or 43%, which is mainly due to increased recovery of delivery fees and other pass-through charges. Re-rent was up $17 million.\nUsed sales for the quarter were $211 million, a decline of $56 million or about 21% from the first quarter last year. We decided to sell less fleet so far this year, mainly to support the robust rental demand we've seen through the first quarter that we expect will continue into our busy season. The market for our used equipment continue to be very strong, supported primarily through better pricing and a higher percentage of fleet sold through our most profitable retail channel. Adjusted used margin was 57.8%, which represents sequential improvement of almost 560 basis points and year-over-year improvement of just over 1,500 basis points.\nLet's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.14 billion, another record for us and an increase of 30.5% year-over-year or $266 million. The dollar change includes a $317 million increase from rental. Now in that, OER contributed $278 million. Ancillary was up $37 million, and re-rent added $2 million. Used sales helped adjusted EBITDA by $8 million, while other non-rental lines of business provided $11 million. SG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $70 million, driven in part by higher commissions on higher revenue. And as expected, we saw certain discretionary costs continue to normalize.\nAlso coming in as expected were adjusted EBITDA margin and flow-through for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was a solid 45.1%, up 270 basis points year-over-year, with a strong flow-through of 57%. This reflects, in large part, excellent cost discipline across the business as we manage inflation, including in areas like delivery and fuel. Increased fleet productivity and higher used margins also helped to offset not just inflation pressures, but the impact of normalizing costs like overtime and T&E.\nI'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was a company best of $5.73 for the first quarter. That's up 66% or $2.28 versus last year, primarily from higher net income.\nLooking at CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $482 million in Q1, which is higher than a typical first quarter and followed the fourth quarter last year where we brought in a record amount of fleet. And to Matt's earlier point, we've managed our fleet levels to service robust customer demand. So while our fleet levels grew sequentially in what is typically our slowest time of the year, we've put that additional fleet to work, supporting the 13% increase in fleet productivity I mentioned earlier. Our proceeds from used equipment sales were $211 million, resulting in net CapEx in the first quarter of $271 million. That's up $243 million versus the first quarter last year.\nNow turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 10.9% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 60 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year. Importantly, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital.\nLet's turn to free cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $572 million in free cash flow in the first quarter after investing a record amount in CapEx. We've continued to delever the balance sheet, which is rock solid. Leverage was 2.0x at the end of the first quarter, down 20 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from first quarter 2021. I'll note that our leverage is currently at the lowest level in our history.\nLiquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong, $3 billion. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.9 billion and cash of $101 million.\nA quick note on our share repurchase program. We spent $262 million through March 31 on our current $1 billion program, having bought back just over 800,000 shares. We still expect to finish that program this year.\nLet's look forward now and talk about our updated guidance for 2022, which we shared in our press release last night. Total revenue is now expected in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.5 billion or an increase of $450 million. That shared a number of insights on the demand environment, and that is what underlies this raise, broad demand we are seeing across the geographies in which we operate and the end markets we serve. We have confidence that we can capitalize on that strength in our end markets and flow that through to the bottom line. That will come largely from a combination of better fleet productivity and a continued focus on costs as we manage inflation in our business.\nAs a result, we have raised our adjusted EBITDA range to be $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, up $250 million from our previous guidance. At the midpoint, we will increase EBITDA margin by 150 basis points and delivered strong flow-through for the year of about 56%. Our range for growth and net CapEx is unchanged. We still expect to source $3 billion of gross CapEx at the midpoint. Now similar to our actions in the first quarter, for the full year, we expect to sell less fleet than planned given the demand opportunity. However, we expect proceeds on those sales will remain consistent with our original guidance considering the current strength in our used market. That leaves our net CapEx guide unchanged as well.\nAnd finally, our free cash flow guidance has increased $200 million as we now look to generate between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. That increase is mainly due to higher operating profit expected for our business this year.\nNow let's get to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.\n\nMatthew J. Flannery\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I know there's a lot of interest in 2022. But before I go there, I want to take a look back because the foundation for our current outlook can be found in our 2021 performance.\nI'll start with our strong finish to the year. As you saw yesterday, our record results for the quarter solidly outperformed expectations for growth and profitability. We grew fourth quarter rental revenue by 25% year-over-year and total revenue by over 21%. And our adjusted EBITDA was 26% higher than a year ago with a margin improvement of 170 basis points. This translated to a solid flow-through of 55%.\nThese gains capped a full year performance that was far better than we could have imagined back in January. Our team is firing on all cylinders with strong execution in the field, solid cost control, effective investment in the business and thoughtful management of our resources, starting with our talent base. In short, it's our people who outperformed expectations, and our numbers reflected that.\nI want to stay with this theme for a minute and summarize some of the accomplishments for the year. We maintained a strong safety record, finishing with a full year recordable rate of 0.79, and that was while integrating multiple acquisitions. We also grew our net headcount by 12%. Roughly half of that came through M&A.\nAnd the $1.4 billion of capital we allocated to acquisitions is generating attractive returns. In fact, our 2021 return on invested capital improved by 140 basis points to end the year at 10.3. We also generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow last year after investing a record $3 billion of rental CapEx, and we sourced that equipment in the midst of a supply chain disruption.\nOn the ESG front, our company recently earned an upgrade to an A rating by MSCI. We've received similar scores from other ESG rating agencies, reflecting our commitment to our progressive culture. Environmental, social and governance matters have been drivers of value in our business for more than a decade, and it's gratifying to see that recognized.\nNow on to 2022. As you can tell from our guidance, we're very confident in our industry's outlook for strong growth this year. A number of key indicators have been moving the needle higher for months, including the broad recovery in construction and industrial demand, the continued strength of the used equipment market and an economy that's moving in the right direction despite some lingering challenges.\nGiven these dynamics, it's not surprising that industry sources show a steady increase in confidence among contractors. And our own customer confidence index improved throughout 2021, ending at its highest point at the end of the year.\nAnd importantly, the same optimism was echoed by our field leaders last month as we worked through our annual planning process. And we heard it again at our virtual meeting. We had our annual management meeting virtually 2 weeks ago, and this meeting is always a great opportunity to get everyone aligned on goals and strategies. And it's clear that our people are fired up for the opportunity.\nThey could see the benefits of the countless improvements that we've made over the past decade, both operationally and also with our customer service. And they know those efficiencies count for a lot as we grow the top line.\nThe biggest signpost pointing to ongoing growth in 2022 is the diversity of the demand that we're seeing in our end markets. In the fourth quarter, we grew rental revenue by double digits across all of our regions, and all verticals showed positive growth as well. And these were solid increases with rental revenues from nonres construction verticals up 24% year-over-year, and infrastructure up 11%. Industrial also grew 11% with strong gains in refining, metals and minerals and power. And it's notable that both nonres and industrial picked up steam in the back half of '21 with year-over-year rental revenue gains in Q4 coming in higher than those in Q3.\nOur specialty segment had another strong performance with every line of business growing double-digit year-over-year. The segment as a whole reported a rental revenue gain of 45%, including a pro forma growth of 28%.\nThis year, we're planning for around 40 cold starts in specialty following the 30 that we opened this last year. Specialty is key to our competitive differentiation. And given the segment's history of high returns, expansion will continue to be a priority for us.\nI'm sharing these numbers to underscore the point I made at the start of my comments that the building blocks for our current outlook were late in 2021. Our core markets have recovered faster than expected. And the underlying construction and industrial forecasts are positive.\nThe broad-based acceleration in the last 12 months has become the foundation for a new cycle of growth. And for the first time since COVID arrived, we're seeing a sustained improvement in long-term visibility, which gives us some insight into future market conditions. And that's a huge plus for us after 2 years of unchartered waters.\nI'll mention a couple of tailwinds on our radar. One, of course, is the infrastructure bill, which will add an additional $550 billion of funding for projects directly in our wheelhouse over the next 5 years. We've been expanding our infrastructure capabilities for years, and we have a rock-solid value proposition with traction in the right verticals for this bill. We expect to see some benefits as early as 2023.\nAnother tailwind in our future is the relocation of manufacturing operations back to the U.S. Onshoring initially drives demand for construction followed by the need for our industrial services once they're up and running. The pandemic has caused manufacturers to rethink how they operate, and we've already seen some funding for new projects tied to this trend.\nAlong with the increase in customer demand comes a large responsibility to have equipment available for rent. And I mentioned that we brought in $3 billion of fleet last year when equipment wasn't easy to find. And that was a home run for the company and for our customers. And we're continuing to work with our strategic partners to land a similar amount of fleet this year.\nAnd finally, before Jess goes over the numbers, I want to mention an announcement we made yesterday and a milestone that's coming up later this year. The announcement is our share repurchase program. We expect this program to return $1 billion to shareholders in 2022.\nAnd the milestone I mentioned is our anniversary. United Rentals will turn 25 years old this year. And as you know, we've been a growth story from day 1. Even so, I don't think there's been a time in our history when our strategy, culture and financial strength have been more of an advantage than they are right now in this new cycle.\nWe have a highly engaged team, a cohesive customer service network and industry-leading scale that matches the market opportunity. We built these levers into the business to create shareholder value, and they did their job in 2021. Now we'll take that to the next level this year and for the foreseeable future.\nAnd with that, I'll ask Jess to cover the results, and then we'll go to Q&A. So Jess, over to you.\n\nJessica T. Graziano\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Rentals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations behind better seasonal trends in rental revenue and continued discipline in costs. We delivered record results with our total revenue, rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA surpassing prepandemic levels for both the quarter and the full year. The momentum we carried out of the quarter is reflected in the growth you see in our 2022 guidance.\nAnd even as we invested record amounts in CapEx last year, we generated a significant amount of free cash flow at just over $1.5 billion, and we expect to generate even more this year. And more in '22 guidance in a bit, let's dive a little deeper first into the results for the fourth quarter.\nRental revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of $458 million or 24.7% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased $345 million or 22.1%. Our average fleet size was up 13.3% or a $207 million tailwind to revenue. Better fleet productivity provided an additional 10.3% or $161 million and rounding out the change in OER is the inflation impact of 1.5%, which was a drag of $23 million.\nAlso within rental, ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $92 million or 36%. That's primarily due to increased delivery fees and other pass-through charges. Re-rent was up $21 million.\nUsed sales for the quarter were $324 million, which was up $49 million or about 18% from the fourth quarter last year. And the used market continues to be very strong, which supported higher pricing and margin in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted used margin was 52.2%, which represents a sequential improvement of 190 basis points and a year-over-year improvement of 970 basis points. Our used proceeds in Q4 recovered a very healthy 60% of the original cost for fleet that averaged over 7 years old.\nLet's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year or $272 million. The dollar change includes a $282 million increase from rental. And in that, OER contributed $245 million. Ancillary was up $33 million, and re-rent added $4 million. Used sales helped adjusted EBITDA by $52 million.\nSG&A was a headwind to adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, in part from the reset of bonus expense that we've discussed on our prior earnings calls. We also had higher commissions on better revenues and higher T&E, which continues to normalize. Other nonrental lines of business were also a headwind of $4 million.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47.2%. That's up 170 basis points year-over-year with a solid flow-through of 55%. This reflects, in large part, the strong underlying cost performance in the fourth quarter, which absorbs costs that continue to normalize, inflation headwinds and the fourth quarter impact of our bonus reset.\nI'll shift to adjusted EPS, which was $7.39 for the fourth quarter. That's up 47% or $2.35 versus last year primarily from higher net income.\nLooking at CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $690 million, the largest fourth quarter we've ever had. We put that fleet to work supporting the demand we saw in the quarter, which will carry into the start of 2022.\nOur proceeds from used equipment sales were $324 million, resulting in net CapEx in the fourth quarter of $366 million. That's up $465 million versus the fourth quarter last year.\nNow turning to ROIC, which was a healthy 10.3% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 80 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points year-over-year. Importantly, our ROIC continues to run comfortably above our weighted average cost of capital.\nLet's turn to free cash flow and the balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, we generated over $1.5 billion in free cash flow after investing a record $3 billion in CapEx last year. We deployed that free cash flow to help fund over $1.4 billion in acquisition activity.\nWe've also continued to delever the balance sheet, which is in great shape. Leverage was 2.2x at the end of the fourth quarter. That's down 20 basis points sequentially and versus the end of 2020.\nLiquidity at the end of the year remains robust at over $2.85 billion. That's made up of ABL capacity of just over $2.65 billion and availability on our AR facility of $57 million. We also had $144 million in cash.\nLet's look forward now and talk about our guidance for 2022, which we shared in our press release last night. The headline here is our plan to deliver a year of strong profitable growth, servicing our customers in this new cycle.\nOur total revenue range is supported by solid demand we expect to see broadly across our end markets in 2022, equating to almost 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. That will be supported by a significant investment in growth capital included in the gross CapEx guidance.\nOur adjusted EBITDA range includes the impact of our remaining diligent on costs as we manage inflation this year. At the midpoint, we'll generate over $5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, growing mid-teens year-over-year. Implied margins expand over 100 basis points with flow-through in the mid-50s.\nWe expect to generate another year of significant free cash flow, guiding to $1.6 billion at the midpoint. The strength of our cash flow continues to provide significant firepower available to invest in growth while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. It also provides an opportunity to return cash to shareholders.\nAnd as Matt mentioned, this week, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we intend to complete in 2022. This leaves us plenty of capacity given our leverage targets for M&A.\nNow let's get to your questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

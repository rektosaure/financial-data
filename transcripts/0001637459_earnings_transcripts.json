I am encouraged by our progress in the third quarter, recognizing there's more work to do to navigate today's complex environment.

That said, the operating environment remains challenging, with worsening consumer sentiment and ongoing inflation, influencing buying behavior around the world.\nTo reflect our third quarter results and the expected continuation of these macro trends, we have updated our 2025 outlook. We remain on track to separate into 2 independent companies in the second half of 2026. And while we manage that transition, our priority is to drive performance today and position both businesses for long-term success. I want to thank our teams for their efforts and our customers, consumers and shareholders for their support.\nWith that, I have Andre joining me, so let's open the call for the Q&A.",

Listen, I'm pleased to report that our Q2 results came in line with our expectations, with an improvement in year-over-year top-line performance. Our investments in product superiority, manufacturing capabilities, and key areas of our business are starting to pay off, driving momentum and giving us confidence to reiterate our 2025 full-year outlook. And while we do not have any new news to report today in our consideration of strategic transactions, I do want to assure you that we are actively progressing on our evaluation with a focus on unlocking long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I have Andrew joining me, so let's open the call for the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. The confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Good morning. Carlos, during the quarter, Kraft Heinz put out a release that the company was considering various strategic transactions to create value. As there's nothing specific from the company yet, perhaps maybe we can talk a little bit more in generalities. There was obviously a report from the Wall Street Journal about potential business separation. I know you can't comment on specifics, but I guess how would you respond to investors that would say such actions oftentimes can be nothing more than financial engineering moves that come with higher costs and dyssynergies rather than sort of unlocking value?\nI'm really just trying to provide maybe a forum where you can talk a little bit about these sorts of things maybe more in general as Kraft looks at a lot of different possibilities, right, to try and unlock value.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nWell, thank you, Andrew. Always great to hear from you. As I said, our board is working with urgency on our evaluation of those strategic options to unlock, as you said, long-term strategic value creation. And what I will say also is, and I'll remind our investors, is that we will operate with the same financial discipline you have come to expect from us. So any actions, if any, will be consistent with that goal of unlocking that long-term shareholder value. And that's essentially all I can say at this time. But thank you for your question.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYep, gave it a shot. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nAndre, maybe [crosstalk] a bit more of a morning.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nMaybe a bit more of a technical one. There was a pretty sizable impairment that was taken in the quarter, and was just hoping to get a little bit more detail. It seemed like it was maybe more at the enterprise level, but I didn't know if that flowed down to any of the brands in particular or if it's at all tied to, as you contemplate, kind of strategic transactions and you think about moving different pieces, like that the reporting change triggered the impairment. Again, it's relatively sizable, so just hoping to get some more detail there. Thanks very much.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nSir, thanks for the question. So look, we recorded a $9.3 billion non-cash impairment charge, and the trigger for that was only the fact that we have a sustained decline in the stock price, and that has reduced the carrying value of our intangible assets. We have been monitoring this for some time. We disclosed, in our previously filed 10-Q, the risk that this could happen. So it's not really nothing new and nothing beyond that. This does not change the view that we have of the company, including the confidence and direction we have in the strategy.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Restaurants and Food Producers Team, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about your pricing and promotion levels currently. Where do you see perhaps an opportunity or a challenge to ramp up promotions or narrow price gaps? And where do you feel like you've taken the steps already that you're comfortable where you are versus your nearest competitors, even if that's private label? And I have a follow-up.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, David. Let me start, and then hand it off to Andre if you want to give additional commentary. But I guess I would just say as context, we are certainly a consumer-centric brand, first of all, which means that we are making sure that our brands are brands that are going to continue to build for the long term. What you see from us is that we continue to make investments across the board. Some of that investment is actually in pricing. We're including about 100 beeps in price year-over-year. We also are, on top of that, investing another 30 beeps in marketing so that we can reach about 4.8% of marketing as a percent of net sales by 2025, by the end of 2025, which will be the highest\nlevel in nearly a decade. So in terms of pricing, I guess one clarification that I will make is that if you look at pricing in North America, when you exclude the COP inflation, it's actually negative. So that gives you a sense that we're also being thoughtful about how to think about pricing. Andre, anything else you would add?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nWell, as we said before, we have built into our initial plan about $300 million of investments. We have added a little more towards H2. We have been concentrating the investments mainly on the key windows. You see more activity now in Q3 as we are now at the peak of the summer. There are some investments that you have saved for this moment as we have a lot of product renovations hitting the market and some core innovations hitting right now.\nSo we concentrated the efforts on that so we can have the new product, the extra marketing, and those investments all hitting at the same time to improve the chance of success. So I mean, beyond that, there is nothing to say. Carlos, I don't want to [assume].\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add, David, here is that it's important to know that we are pricing well below inflation. In fact, we expect the inflation to be about 5% to 7 this year, and we're only passing about around 1% of the pricing. So we are, in fact, keeping the consumer in mind as we're taking these actions on pricing. Sounds like you had another question, David?\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Restaurants and Food Producers Team, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. No, thank you for that. Just one thing I'm thinking about with regard to Kraft Heinz, particularly as you think about strategic actions, and presumably there's parts of the business that might garner a higher multiple than the others. Is this problem that we see across food right now where legacy parts of businesses that might be growthier are not doing as well as they might have done over the long term? And I'm wondering how you're thinking about that with regard to whether it's accelerate, protect, or balance. We're seeing, on average, declines continuing in those businesses. What is your prospects, I guess, to make your growth parts growthy in the near term, particularly if you\nwant to shine a good light on those parts of the business as you think about strategic actions? Thanks.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you. I guess let me go back to our strategy that we have been consistent following for the last 18 months or so, which is we are making investments to make sure that we're growing across emerging markets, North America retail, and away from home. And in fact, we are continuing to make investment to drive that growth and return capital to our shareholders. And when you look at our pillars, in fact, in emerging markets, you saw we grew our top line by around 8% through both price and volume, at the same time expanding margins substantially. In fact, we now in emerging markets have our highest OI margin ever. If you look at North America retail and accelerate platforms, we\nactually are investing also to powered by the Brand Growth System, and we are executing through Agile ways of working. And let me just say that if you look at the sales data, IRI data over the last four weeks, in fact, when you exclude cold cuts and bacon, that drove about 40% of the decline, the rest of the portfolio in total North America retail actually is improving substantially. In fact, in the latest four weeks, ex cold cuts and bacon, we are down 2.7%. Year to date, we're down 4%. So you are seeing that the actions we're taking in North America retail are also helping us drive the kind of improvements that we wanted to see in the business. And finally, in away from home, we are also\nexpanding into footprints and distribution, and driving new innovation into the marketplace. The last thing I will say is that we're not done. We're going to continue to invest in the business because we are confident in the strategy. We're making sure we continue to invest in marketing, like I said earlier. We continue to step our investment in e-commerce, which is helping us also drive our improvements in North America. And frankly, we also have a solid balance sheet that allows us, and a strong cash flow that allows us to continue to make these investments. So we feel very good that when you look deeply into our growth pillars, all those actions and investments we're making are,\nin fact, taking shape in order for us to be able to continue to drive the company towards long-term success.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nI think beyond that, we have, as I said before, we have a lot of product renovation hitting the market right now behind mac and cheese, Lunchables, mayo, just to name those three. We have a 20% market increase year over year expected to the second half. So the vast majority of all the media increases are all happening now in the second semester. We have, as we said, the step-ups, some investments on price towards the key windows that are still to come. So there is a lot more happening that we should continue to see accelerate part of the portfolio in North America improving gradually throughout the remaining quarters. Thank you, David.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Restaurants and Food Producers Team, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just seeing if you could provide more detail on your sales trends across emerging markets. I know there's a big opportunity for distribution gains and away from home in the region. So just curious how those gains have tracked versus your expectations so far this year, and how should we think about the pace of those gains in the back half versus the front half? And really, what's giving you the confidence in that double-digit exit rate for this year?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nGreat question. Thank you, Leah. Listen, I mean, I mentioned that we, in fact, were very pleased to see that the top line now grew about 8%. I think what's behind those numbers, though, is the fact that the growth is coming from both volume and price. And the fact that we are doing that while actually increasing our margins at the same time gives us quite a bit of confidence that as we look at the end of this year, we should be able to be hitting a long-term algorithm of double-digit growth. And for us, we continue to see investment in our business, and it's not going to stop. Today already, it represents about $2.5 billion business of our business overall.\nI think what I think that gives me confidence is the fact that when you look at step-backs and you look at emerging markets, it's really a more simple portfolio. It is focused on taste elevation, in particular in our Heinz brand, and we have a strong go-to-market model. So when you look at the double-click of Heinz in emerging markets, it actually grew about 18% year-over-year. So it is building on the strength of our key brand in a business that we know how to operate with a model that we now have been able to replicate across markets. So it's something that now we have been building on the success that we have in the past historically, and now we're expanding to make sure that we're\ngrowing in LATAM, we're growing in our Middle East, Asia, and Middle East, Africa, and Asia. I think for us, we continue to believe that this is a place where we have tremendous opportunity for now and for the long term. Thank you, Leah.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. And I think inflation and promotions that were pushed into the Q3, any color on the magnitude of that impact, what drove the timing shift, and how you view kind of those cost pressures around inflation today?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nSorry, Leah. You got cut off at the beginning of the question. If you can repeat it.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOh, sure. You had called out incremental inflation and promotions that were pushed from Q2 into Q3. Just any color on the magnitude of that impact we should think about on a quarterly cadence basis? And then what was the driver of that timing shift for those two items, and how are you thinking about inflationary cost pressures today?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nLook, magnitude is in the range of 30, 40 beeps. Yeah, 30, 40 beeps. Nothing special. It's mostly the recognition based on the inventory positions and the throughput. That's how these inventories got recognized in the P&L. So that's why it shifted Q2, Q3. So there's nothing really beyond that.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Leah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Megan Karl with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMegan Karl [Vice President, Wealth Management, Financial Advisor, Portfolio Management Director, and Financial Planning Speciali\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks so much. I wanted maybe a follow-up just on the organic sales growth in North America retail. There was a comment in the prepared remarks that you expect gradual long-term improvement in top line trends. And clearly, it seems like just based on your comment around exit rate on emerging markets and food service that the gating factor here continues to be North America retail. So maybe you can just update us on how you're thinking about timing of getting back to just maybe stabilization first and foremost in North America retail. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you. I think for me, what I would say is, and if you go back to kind of the strategy was fueling our growth and the improvements in North America performance, it is all the fact that we have now invested through our Brand Growth System back in our products. So we're investing in our products of priority. We're investing in better marketing, investing in better tools with e-commerce investments that we have made over the last six months. And that is giving us the confidence that we continue to see that now play into the marketplace. We ended last year with Brand Growth System impacting about 10% of our business, but at the end of this year, it will be about 40% of our\nbusiness disproportionately focused in North America accelerated platforms. You can see how when we are applying that methodology, that actually is driving our improvement in performance. In fact, let me give you an example of Capri-Sun, which is a business that we renovated. We invested back in the business. We improved the marketing. We improved the products. We make sure that we highlighted the benefits that it has with parents and kids that have no artificial flavors, that we have superior taste, that we have better qualities in terms of things that kids love to have, that we have better promotions partnering with places like Nintendo, that we bring in new ideas\ninto marketplace like Capri-Sun with new promotional limited edition products, whether that is we bringing new channels, whether it's club, whether it's convenient. So you see how when we apply the Brand Growth System at a brand like Capri-Sun, that's the comprehensive investments we make, the improvement that it yields in our business. So that, along with the fact that we continue to step up our marketing, as I mentioned earlier, about 30 beeps to get us about 4.8% by the end of the year, that combination of the way we are investing, the fact that we're investing more, and that we're using Agile ways of working to then take those learnings and apply it to the portfolio is a\ncombination that we believe is the right tools in order to drive complete continued improvements in our North America retail business.\n\nMegan Karl [Vice President, Wealth Management, Financial Advisor, Portfolio Management Director, and Financial Planning Speciali\n\nOkay. Thanks for that.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you for the question.\n\nMegan Karl [Vice President, Wealth Management, Financial Advisor, Portfolio Management Director, and Financial Planning Speciali\n\nThank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Andre on the gross margin outlook. Inflation, I think, overall looks to be unchanged for the year at that 5% to 7, obviously a wide range. But would you be able to just update us on what base input cost inflation is versus tariffs if that's changed at all? And then how should we be thinking about what carries into 2026, just what looks to be given a kind of lower exit rate on gross margin in the back half relative to the first half? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So in terms of inflation before tariffs, we have the peak of the commodities hitting in Q2, but some of that in terms of P&L recognition got pushed into Q3. And we should start to expect some sort of relief starting in Q4, so we should start to reach the inflection points. We still have pockets of high commodity inflation, particularly on meat and coffee. Regarding the tariffs, the current expectation based on the latest is an impact of approximately 100 beeps this year linked to the tariffs. And if the tariffs remain as they are right now, it will create a full year annualized impact of approximately 180 beeps. So there will be some carryover into that affecting 2026.\nAs I said before, there are a lot of actions in place for procurement teams and also for commercial teams to mitigate as much as we can, being mindful about their current consumer situation. But some pricing is required, and that's what we are doing.\n\nLeah Jordan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Max Gumpert with BNP Paribas.\n\nMax Gumpert\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nHey. Thanks for the question. In contrast to our peers that have recently established their off-calendar FY2026 outlooks have embedded some pretty meaningful margin pressure over the coming quarters from substantial reinvestment. I recognize with your marketing going to at least 4.8% of sales and media spending going up at least 20% year over year, you are also reinvesting, but it still feels a bit less sizable than what we are seeing from some of these peers. So particularly in light of the continued volume declines, I just want to get a better sense for what's giving you the confidence that your investment plans for this year are appropriate. Thanks.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for the question. Look, as everything we do, we are always very disciplined in our investments, and we like to test investments before scaling them up. So we feel good about the actions that we are doing for this year. I think those are the right ones, and the magnitudes are appropriate as well. And as we said in the last earnings, if we see the results expected from them, we will not hesitate to step up. Keep in mind as well that we are actively expanding the Brand Growth System to more brands as we speak. So this is part of the reason as well why we decided to step up investments a little more beyond what we initially said last quarter. And as opportunities show up as part of this\nassessment, we will continue to step up investments. At this point, we're really trying to grow the business in a way that we think is healthy, not through price, but through really stronger products and stronger attributes, stronger marketing, which takes more time, but it's the right thing to do. But we are going to step up investments if it is deemed appropriate. That's for sure. Thank you.\n\nMax Gumpert\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nOkay. I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nVice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question is from Alexia Howard with Bernstein Research.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nMorning.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nCan I ask about the pace of innovation? If I remember correctly, you were pretty low on the innovation front for much of the pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions, but it sounded as though you exited 2024 at a somewhat higher rate, but probably still quite a lot lower than peers. Can you talk about where you're at today as a percentage of sales, where you'd like to get to over time, and how quickly you could get there, just so we can get a sense for how quickly that might be ramping up? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO and Member of Board of Directors, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Alexia, for your question. I guess let me just give you a little bit of context, which is for us, it's important that when we define innovation, we're also thinking through what are the places that we can, in fact, renovate many of our key products. So when we talk about our Brand Growth System and the fact that it allows us to focus on us, making sure we bring the attributes to consumers they care about in our core business, that is actually a key part of also thinking through how do we maintain innovation within our business. I have to say, as you pointed out, I think that if we go back to 2022, I think the number on our innovation was around 1.6% of our sales.\nBy the end of the last year, it was about 3% of our sales. So we're going to continue to drive on that investment on innovation to contribute a larger part of our business as we go forward. But I would say it also is already paying off. So if you think about the innovation that we have brought in, like the experience of bringing the Taco Bell restaurant experience to home, it is now the second year in which we're growing that business double digit, and now we're expanding to Canada. I mentioned earlier Capri-Sun bottle that we are now bringing into club, we're bringing into single serve, and now it's achieving high levels of velocity too wherever we have taken that product outside of the\npouch. And we're also making sure that we continue to drive innovation in our Heinz business. I mean, whether that is looking at how do we take it into pasta sauce, which is happening across many of our businesses across both Europe and Latin America, but it's also making sure that we continue to expand on the importance of our Heinz mayo business across our international portfolio and continue to expand into new countries as we go into 2026. So while you're right that we continue to see opportunities for innovation, our focus continues to be making sure we have the right core products with the right renovation in those businesses, and at the same time, being thoughtful\nabout how do we are actually bringing innovation to market that has the long-term opportunity to be here for many, many years. And I'm pleased to what I'm seeing. I also think that there's more for us to do. The last thing I would say is it's important to recognize when we talk about the brand growth system, it also creates and highlights opportunity for us to go after new innovation. So you're going to continue to see us going to marketplace, whether that is with the kind of focus on not only line extension and new exciting flavors, but ways in which we can actually continue to make sure our brands are relevant for now and for the future. More to come. Thank you, Alexia.\n\nAlexia Howard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts, and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risk and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statement and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. I will now hand it over to our CEO, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, for opening comments. Carlos, over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. At Kraft Heinz, we are proud to be a trusted partner in Kitchens Everywhere, providing comfort and connections, particularly in these moments of uncertainty. Despite growing market pressure in Q1, we delivered top-line results in line with our expectations, with strong cash flow performance and a healthy balance sheet. We are also encouraged by the progress we're making in improving brand superiority. While these advancements are not yet reflected in the financial results, they do give me confidence that we are putting in place the right building blocks. Our commitment to making the necessary investments to deliver quality and value offerings to our consumers is unwavering. At the same time, we are closely monitoring market tension and have adjusted our guidance accordingly. With that, I have Andre joining me, so let's open the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment while we poll our first question. The first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Carlos, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the revised outlook provides the necessary flexibility to dial in on investments as deemed appropriate. And that said, this is not the first time, right? Kraft Heinz has sort of used this language around proposed investments. And so far, it's not proved enough, although admittedly in a very dynamic consumer environment. Many industry players, I think, have taken the approach of kind of like increasing investments on what seems to be more of an incremental basis to see how the consumer reacts, almost like a sort of a test-and-learn approach.\nThe magnitude of today's guidance cut is larger than previous ones, but I'm still getting a lot of questions from investors, I guess, as to whether this is more of the same sort of approach or if you see it as more comprehensive in some way. Thanks so much.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. First, let me just say we are continuing to invest in the business despite what we are seeing in terms of the macroeconomic uncertainty because, frankly, because we're confident in the strategy that we have. And I think in moments like this, a company can be sometimes overly cautious and defensive or play offense. And we are choosing to play offense with discipline. So we are in fact prioritizing investments in marketing, R&D, and technology. And the way we're doing that, Andrew, is we focus on increasing returns of our marketing dollars by shifting more towards a consumer-facing marketing. We're also making sure we're optimizing the allocation across the brands and media types so that, in fact, we make sure we have the best ROI while improving the quality of the messaging at the same time. I mentioned investing in R&D.\nWe are going to continue to invest behind our innovation pipeline. We are making sure we are closing the gap to our investment levels, that is, the 1% of net sales. I mentioned technology. We are going to continue investing in our technology as well because that actually has helped us in terms of driving the efficiencies in the business by investing in things like automation and enhanced digital tools. But I think you also spoke to why is this different, what's different now versus in the past. I'll tell you, one of the important parts of what is different is the fact that we're also investing through the brand growth system.\nAnd if you recall, the Brand Growth System is our repeatable global model for understanding how we see opportunities within our brands and how do we make sure we drive superiority on those brands through both products and packaging and making sure that every communication has the right brand resonance, value equation, and on the execution. So it's not just what we are spending, but how we are spending too. And we mentioned in the past that we had done this with about 10% of our brands in 2024 as a way to pilot. That is in fact now being scaled up to 40% of our business by the end of this year.\nSo that idea of us having more confidence in us investing because now we have proven that the Brand Growth System helps us identify the right opportunities and allows us to make sure we take the right steps in order to fuel the investments, I think, is part of why we're going to be playing offense with discipline. So you'll see us actually step up our investments in marketing and also to make sure that as we renovate our products, we are supporting it with the right focus on the consumer communication.\nSo we invested behind the BGS. We make sure we have the great products packaged with quality. Then we make sure we have the right communication to support it and drive that forward. It's something that helped us work with our Philadelphia brand in 2024. It helped us in our Heinz UK business in the last year and now we are going to be seeing that across all of our brands towards 2024, 2025 here in the US.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew. Just to add to Carlos. So remember that in our prior guidance, we already had contemplated a step up in price investments. And just roughly speaking, to the extent of 100 basis points on the top line, so it was a relevant investment and concentrated on those categories we have previously described. And we also had in the prior guidance already contemplated a double-digit increase in media. So we were still retaining our marketing percentage of revenue at 4.5% in the prior guidance. And with that, by relocating expenses within the marketing bucket, we could free up double-digit increase in media. Now, in this new guidance, we have opened the room to further accelerate our market investment.\nRemember that in our long-term algorithm, we want to be approximate at 5%. We have in the midpoint of the guidance around 4.8% of market, so a 30 basis points step up. This number might still fluctuate a little bit up or down, depending on how the dynamics happen throughout the year, including final impact on tariffs. But we want to accelerate the step up to reach the 5%. And we also have in the guidance some impacting cards linked to product renovation. As Carlos said, as we continue to deploy the brand growth system, we have seen opportunities not only to improve quality of messaging and have more media pressure, but also to renovate the products and ensure a stronger superiority.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Yasmine Deswandhy with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for the question. So I kind of wanted to dig in a little bit on North America and the organic sales guidance update for this year. Just for Q2 specifically, there's a few items here to consider. You talked about the Easter timing shift, and then there's a plant closure left. But there were also impacts last year on Lunchables from the Consumer Reports. And then you had the Capri Sun reformulation impacting consumption. So could you help size those impacts, if any, to the Q2? And if there's anything else that we should consider that will drive a gap between North America shipments versus consumption?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, we expect the Q2 top line to be better than the Q1 top line. The effect of Easter, as I have said before, is approximately 90 to 100 basis points. So that will be a tailwind in the Q2. In addition to that, we have emerging markets in all parts of the US, but we have emerging markets further accelerating from where we were in Q1. And inside the US, aside from Easter, we're going to see improvement in the accelerated platforms. So Cream Cheese and Ore-Ida, for example, they declined in Q1, and this was totally expected because we were lapping competitors with out-of-stock issues last year. But now we restore growth, and we're going to see growth in those two categories in the quarter. And to your point, we will see some improvement in Lunchables.\nIt's still not the levels that we believe we can achieve as the main innovation hits the market at the end of Q2. But you should see Lunchables improving, particularly after mid-May and June 2025, because that's when we really start to fully lap the Consumer Reports from last year. On the Muscatine, on the factory, we are lapping that as we head into Q2, but bearing in mind that the industry foodservice has gone down quite a lot this year. So we are not going to see necessarily a growth in away from home in Q2. But beyond that, you will see the accelerated platforms, sausage, cream cheese, meals, and snacking with a better performance in comparison to Q1.\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. That's really helpful. A quick follow-up to that, just looking into the second half of the year, obviously understanding that Q2 will see some nice improvement on volumes given the one-time items that you just mentioned. Your organic sales cut was basically all volumes since the pricing contribution was left unchanged. Do you see a need for North America volumes to inflect positively in the second half in order to hit your guide? Or do you expect growth in international, particularly in emerging markets, to be enough to hit your guidance for the year?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nNo, we don't need. In fact, in the midpoint of our guidance, total company does not get to positive in any quarter.\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWe don't need volume. Okay?\n\nYasmine Deswandhy\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the COGS inflation, the revised outlook, just any breakdown of how much of that is related to tariffs versus maybe other drivers of that increase, and then just the timing of when we really start to see that step up. Thank you.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. So in our prior outlook, we had inflation at 3%. So before any tariffs, our guidance is step up to 5% of COGS. Particularly in some commodities like coffee and meats, we saw a big increase in comparison to the rest of the last time we met. So the base inflation was already up to 5%. And now with the tariff impact, I mean, obviously a lot of uncertainties around that, but we do estimate with what we know so far an impact in 2025 of 150 to 200 basis points on the COGS. Timing-wise, look, we don't know for sure, right? We are assuming that this will be concentrated in H2. Maybe there will be some impact in Q2. We built some inventory where possible in certain items as we anticipated that to happen.\nSo that gives a little relief of a month, maybe a two in some of the items, but the impact should be mostly concentrated in the second half.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you for that. I noted, or sorry, I noticed that there wasn't a change in kind of that pricing outlook, as Yasmine just noted. It sounds like there's price investment in some areas, and then there is incremental pricing in other areas. Maybe just any detail you can provide there.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo in the midpoint of the new guidance, we don't have further investments in price in addition to the approximately 100 basis points we already had contemplated in the initial outlook. So the incremental investments, as I said, is mostly on marketing, particularly media, on product renovation. And there is some sampling investments because we remember that as we renovate the products, including the ones that we have renovated last year like Capri Sun, we really need to step up the trial curve. So we are stepping up sampling investments heading into the summer.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thank you for the details.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. A couple of questions. You updated your inflation guidance, and thanks for your comments there on the tariffs being incorporated in that. I wonder how you're thinking about pricing offsets to that. And when it gets to a certain level of input inflation and your willingness to price that away, are there levels where you have to be cognizant of rising price elasticity, perhaps over a few percent, for example, where you're more aware of any sort of list pricing, and you have to start moving towards other types of adjustments or offsets? And then separately, and Andre, I know you've been very active in thinking about promotional activity and returns on that promotional activity.\nWhen we look at our data, it looks like Kraft Heinz has been a little bit different than some of the other larger food companies in that it's well below 2019 levels in terms of its volume on promotion, whereas many, many years, if not most other companies look like they're at those levels already and continuing to rise. I'm wondering if you kind of recognize that juxtaposition and how you think about the promotion strategy going forward. Is that something that you're noticing as well? Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me start with the second part, Carlos, and then have Andre kind of comment a little bit on the first part of your questions. First of all, what you're seeing is the fact that it follows our strategy. I mentioned earlier that we are going to continue to make investments and play offense with discipline. I think for us, it's the opportunity to make sure that when we are investing, we are doing this in a way that is thoughtful about the return of that investment, and that we are building something that supports our strategy and allows us to grow not only in the short term, but really in the medium and long term. When we invest in pricing for a promotional event, it's because we believe that actually creates the kind of base volume opportunities as we go post that particular event.\nSo you'll see us continue to invest in times of the year that consumer needs us, whether that is now Memorial Day, whether it's July 4th, whether it's back to school. We're just going to do it in a disciplined way to make sure that, again, it's supporting the strategy that we have and not just chase a short-term volume that actually doesn't, essentially, all you do is kind of rent volume for a short period of time. The other piece that is important to note is that when we're making those investments, we're also doing it in concert with our brand growth systems investments.\nSo that when we are going for a back-to-school time period and we have now a renovated new Lunchables, whether we have a renovated new Capri Sun, that's a moment for us to not only stimulate the demand, but also making sure that then consumers get to try the best product that we have ever made on those categories. So I think it's that combination that is kind of guiding our principles versus kind of how competitors are playing at this particular time. They're choosing different strategy. We believe we want to make sure that we're doing things smartly because our focus is to continue to drive profitable growth for the future. Andre, you want to comment on the first part?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So hi, Dave. Look, on the promo side, Carlos said, we will continue to be disciplined and really seeking those promotions with good returns.\nYou will see a step up in promotion activity during the key windows, particularly now in summer. So you will see that number stepping up is part of our initial guidance. Again, we have approximately 100 basis points of incremental price investment in the US. In regards to pricing the tariffs, look, we are trying to do everything we possibly can to minimize the amount of price necessary. So even things like to delay, we have anticipated some purchases. We are looking at alternative sourcing. There is opportunity for, in some cases, reformulation, which takes a little bit longer. There are opportunities on the mixed side. There are certain SKUs within a category that are less impacted than others when it comes to tariffs.\nSo all of that is at play. We are stepping up productivity in the year. We started the year expecting 3.5% of COGS. Now we're expecting a little more than that. So we are taking all the possible levers, but pricing might be necessary. But again, I think this is a work in progress. Thank you, Dave.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi everyone. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins and just a follow-up elsewhere. From a gross margin perspective, specifically the Q2 weakness that you're expecting, and in the context of just how this typically works, is the primary driver of Q2 gross margin weakness coffee inflation? And I guess I asked that question in the context of historically, this is really a pass-through category where pricing comes through to offset the inflation, understanding there's always going to be quarter-to-quarter volatility. But are you seeing perhaps less ability to pass through the coffee inflation just given the overall coffee inflation backdrop? And then just secondly, are there any areas within your portfolio or broader portfolio where you're seeing more bright spots from a market share perspective?\nBecause I think similar to last quarter, where we continue to struggle is the categories have clearly softened, but market share performance has come under more pressure. And so what are those things that you've been doing over the past few months, maybe specifically where you're saying, Okay, that specific strategy is working to kind of right the ship here because it's been a bit harder to see in the data? So thanks for those two items.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. I will start with the Q2 margins. So basically, we do expect pressure on the gross margin in the Q2, and there are a few different items affecting the margin. The first one is, as I just said in the prior question, we do expect a step up in the promotion activity as we start the shipments for the summer season. So we will see a lower price in the P&L. The second, we are facing impacts of some hedged losses in the Q2, and they are quite large. And the good thing is that once they roll off, heading into Q3, we'll start to see some of those commodities that are starting to come down, like dairy, start to flow through the P&L. And third, to your point, there are some increases in certain commodities in Q2.\nAnd the way we see right now, some of them are going to reach the peak in Q2, and that issue starts to go backwards or decelerate at least as we head into Q3. So those three elements are the key contributors for the gross margin pressure that we are seeing. And there is a little bit as well of the product renovations that we're starting to step up. So as a result of that, plus we're starting to step up investment in marketing, we do expect the operating income to decline double digits in Q2. When it regards to the bright spots, that's over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. Listen, I think if you look at our year-to-date, our latest five weeks versus the year-to-date, you see us making progress in all of our accelerate businesses.\nSo whether it's tent elevation, whether it's ready-to-eat meals, whether it is snacking. So all those things are progressing. I think in Q1, obviously, we had the impact of Easter. So I think as we are seeing now the data with several weeks of the Easter now read, you're going to continue to see that improvement. And I think, for example, in a business like our Philadelphia Cream Cheese, which as we now kind of pass the Q1 lapping of the private label not being on the business in the category last year, you see that continue to drive growth. Whether you see that in our desserts business, that continues to drive growth after reformulations and focusing on better-for-you products in that category. So you will see that many of the investments we're making will continue to play off as we go through the year.\nI mentioned that in the opening statement, which is a lot of the great things that we are seeing in terms of the building blocks and not yet all reflecting the data, but those are things that you'll see us as we continue to progress throughout the year. I'm also, frankly, very encouraged about the fact that some of the big innovations we have done have continued to now drive growth. So a business like our Mexican strategy that we didn't have two years ago, we grew double digits last year, and we are growing double digits again this year. So that also gives me confidence, the fact that as we are building innovation, we're doing it with the right insights with consumers to drive growth that is sustainable and profitable for the long term. Thanks for your question.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Megan Clapp with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. This is Alexia on for Megan. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned the wider operating income guide partly reflects changing policy landscape. Should we be thinking about that from a top-line perspective, or is that related to cost? Just any incremental color you could give there would be great. Thanks.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for the question. Look, there are, as you know, a lot of things being discussed and under consideration that might have implications on the business, positive or negative. So part of the reason why we have this wider range is to contemplate a whole different set of scenarios that can come into play.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo we're trying to just provide the flexibility, knowing that there is a number of things that are still volatile, but in that guidance, you see us that we are acknowledging some of those things, we're preparing for those things, and also at the same time, making sure that we have the right flexibility to invest back in the business in order to drive the trade that we have and then fuel the opportunities that we are seeing with our Brand Growth System to expand back in our brands. So that's all reflected in the way we're kind of shaping the year ahead. Thank you, Alexia.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nAnd thank you, everyone, for joining us. Operator, that concludes our Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

During the following remarks, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts, and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies these remarks, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we will refer to Non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information that accompany these remarks, which are available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under news and events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Today, our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, will provide an update on our overall business performance, and Andre Maciel, our Global Chief Financial Officer, will provide a financial review of the Q4 and will discuss our 2025 outlook. We have also scheduled a separate live question and answer session with analysts. You can access our question and answer session at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. A replay will also be available following the event through the same website. With that, I will turn it over to Carlos.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to start with a big thank you to the Kraft Heinz team for working tirelessly in what proved to be a challenging year for us and for the industry. Together, we maintain our focus on building and investing for the future. We have demonstrated our ability to be efficient cash generators, delivering both industry-leading gross margins and strong Free Cash Flow. We have delivered efficiencies to fuel investments that are driving meaningful product renovation and innovation, and enhancing our marketing capabilities, all of which are helping us build brand superiority. And despite a weaker macroeconomic backdrop, we returned meaningful capital to our stockholders in 2024, with $2.7 billion returned through our dividend, which offers the highest yield in food and share buybacks. As we look ahead to 2025, we remain confident in our strategy.\nBy building upon the advancements made in 2024 and executing with excellence, we anticipate improvements each quarter in our top-line performance. This will be driven by growth in emerging markets and global away from home, with US retail benefiting from actions we are taking to further implement our Brand Growth System. And we will do this while preserving profitability, something we have proven we know how to do well. With that, let us turn to our 2024 Full Year results. Organic Net Sales declined 2.1% versus the prior year. Through the lens of our strategic pillars, this was driven by growth in emerging markets, which was more an offset by declines in North America retail, and away from home in the US. Despite the top-line pressure, we generated a 100 basis points of adjusted Gross Profit Margin expansion versus 2023.\nThis was due in large part to the capabilities we have built over the years, including investments in technology that are driving efficiencies across areas like revenue management, manufacturing, and logistics. These efforts enable us to deliver nearly $750 million in gross efficiencies, a portion of which was reinvested in our brands. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to investing, ensuring that our resources are driving sustainable, long-term volume growth. Our gross margin expansion, in addition to a benefit from lower variable incentive compensation for the year, contributed to Adjusted Operating Income growth of 1.2%. The reduction in variable incentive compensation reflects our culture of meritocracy, where performance is closely tied to rewards. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our compensation model in aligning pay with results. Our Adjusted Operating Income growth, along with share repurchases, led to Adjusted EPS growth of 2.7%.\nFinally, Free Cash Flow came in at approximately $3.2 billion, an increase of 6.6% versus the prior year. Moving to the details of our performance across the three strategic pillars. In our accelerated platforms in North America retail, Organic Net Sales declined 2.9%. This was primarily driven by weakening trends in three specific brands and the planned exit of our unprofitable bulk vinegar business. This overshadowed strong performances across our Ore-Ida, Taco Bell, Philadelphia, and Heinz brands, which together make up about 40% of sales in US retail accelerate. In global away from home, Organic Net Sales declined 0.6%. Growth in international away from home was more than offset by a decline in the US. This decline was driven primarily by two planned business exits for margin-diluted businesses, a temporary plant closure in Q2, and softer traffic trends relative to 2023.\nIn the Q4, global away from home came in below our expectations. To improve our performance in 2025, we are committed to providing additional value to our customers. We will be increasing our investment in trade alongside our marketing initiative. Through our premium loyalty program, Heinz Verify, we will provide customers with access to bundles, traffic-driving promotions, and our state-of-the-art culinary portfolio and equipment. Turning to emerging markets, we grew 4% versus full year 2023, driven by both price and volume mix. Excluding pressures experienced in Brazil and China, the rest of emerging markets grew double digits in line with our long-term algorithm. In the Q4, emerging markets' Organic Net Sales came in below our expectations, driven primarily by performance in China, where consumer confidence continues to remain soft.\nAs a result, we saw more than anticipated inventory de-loading as retail customers and distributors are reducing working capital and costs. Now, going a bit deeper into our North America retail business, last quarter, we discussed a couple of core categories that are driving year-over-year top-line pressure, including Lunchables, Kraft Mayonnaise, Kraft Mac and Cheese, and Capri Sun. Across each of these brands, we have kicked off the Brand Growth System, running deep forensic-like assessment that will uncover the most meaningful opportunities to drive brand superiority. We are confident that the Brand Growth System will make a meaningful difference because we have already seen its success in action. In 2024, we ran pilots on Philadelphia cream cheese and Heinz in the UK. On Philadelphia, we captured wide space in growing channels with 13% growth in club.\nOn Heinz Ketchup in the UK, we grew volume share by 2.3 percentage points, a category we haven't grown share in five years. We are now scaling this approach across these four brands with dedicated agile pods already in place for each. And importantly, we are committed to making necessary investments in the products and marketing to close those gaps. In parallel to starting the Brand Growth System, the initial actions we have taken are showing early signs of traction as we're investing in the products to drive superiority. On Lunchables, we are strengthening the core and expanding the occasions. Take, for example, our recent launch of Spicy Nacho, which is 17% incremental to the meal combos category, driven by increases in both buy rate and consumption.\nWe also continue to renovate as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional quality, including upgrades to our cookies and crackers to meet evolving tastes. In our mayonnaise business, we are strengthening our value proposition to re-engage with [inaudible] users and to attract new ones. We are bringing new flavors, including Pickle Mayo, which has successfully rolled out in the US. And we're taking this flavor expansion strategy globally, launching new flavors in countries including Canada, Australia, the UK, and the Middle East. In addition to our flavor strategy, we are delighting consumers with better-for-you options through our Primal Kitchen brand. For Kraft Mac & Cheese, we are connecting and engaging with families and younger consumers. We are doing this through the new bold flavors like Ranch and Jalapeño, better-for-you options, new pack sizes, and unpacked partnerships.\nWe are seeing momentum here with a 1 percentage point improvement in the year-over-year sales trends. And finally, on Capri Sun, I am very excited that we have generated a five percentage point improvement in year-over-year sales. We invested in the product innovation to win on taste, and now we're bringing value to consumers through innovation, including a new 64 ounce multi-serve and our single-serve bottles. Our accelerated platforms represent the most attractive spaces within our portfolio, where we have the highest right to win, and in turn, where we have been prioritizing our investments. This prioritization has contributed to growth across several of our iconic brands, including Philadelphia, Heinz Ketchup, Ore-Ida, and Taco Bell. As I mentioned earlier, Philadelphia is one of the brands we piloted in our Brand Growth System in 2024.\nWe uncovered opportunities to attract under-indexed audiences, to expand distribution in white space channels, and to highlight the versatility of cream cheese across new user occasions. Our initial learnings and actions are yielding results, with 2% dollar gross sales despite lapping private label out-of-stocks in 2023. And Heinz Ketchup grew dollar sales 2% versus 2023. This was driven by impactful marketing campaigns and by increasing distribution from innovation. We have innovated across formats and flavors to deliver on consumer desires, including the successful launch of our Pickle Ketchup, which has been 50% incremental to the flavor ketchup category, and we are now expanding it to four continents. On Ore-Ida, we have been able to meet the strong consumer demand for our products, which in turn enabled us to increase investments in marketing and promotions. This contributed to dollar sale growth of 8% in 2024.\nLastly, Taco Bell had a great year, growing 24% versus 2023. This was driven by expanded distribution and share gains on both existing products and innovation, as we doubled down on the fast-growing Mexican cuisine category, growing at a pace of 4.5%. Turning to our next strategic pillar, global away from home. Despite the decline in our top-line growth, we are seeing wins across each key area of our strategy, growing in higher margin channels, increasing penetration beyond ketchup, and go-to-market excellence. In the US, we gained 70 basis points of share and grew sales mid-single digits for the full year across higher margin, non-commercial channels. This includes wins in entertainment and travel. Earlier this year, we announced a new multi-year partnership with the Chicago Cubs, where Heinz has been named the official condiment of Wrigley Field. This included incremental distribution on Heinz Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, and more.\nI am also excited to share that we have signed a new contract with Hilton Hotels, making Kraft Heinz the preferred vendor for sauces and condiments globally. This presents a large opportunity for us, and we are excited for the doors it unlocks, partnering with Hilton to leverage their worldwide presence in over 130 countries to drive growth. We also continue to expand beyond ketchup. I just mentioned our partnership with the Chicago Cubs. This is one example where fans can also enjoy Kraft Mac and Cheese, Philadelphia, and Primal Kitchen throughout the ballpark. And more recently, we further increased our penetration of Philadelphia cream cheese in away from home with Dunkin'. In US away from home, we grew Philadelphia cream cheese high single digits in 2024.\nWe are focused on go-to-market excellence, leveraging our proven model to not only gain distribution in retail within emerging markets, where we have solid coverage, but also expanding the model into away from home channel. In 2024, we grew total distribution points in emerging markets away from home by 21%. As you can see, our away from home team has been busy this year, and I'm happy to report that for 2025, we have already locked in 75% of the expected sales from new clients wins. Looking at emerging markets, we grew Organic Net Sales both in Q4 and the full year. While this growth was lower than we originally anticipated due to pressures in Brazil, and China, the rest of emerging markets grew double digits, a testament that our strategy is working.\nOur growth drivers in emerging markets are two fold: leveraging the strong brand equity of our Heinz brand and expanding distribution through our go-to-market model. We grew Heinz Organic Net Sales in emerging markets approximately 8% in 2024. Heinz is our largest brand globally, and it represents over $1 billion in sales in emerging markets, accounting for roughly 40% of total sales in the zone. We also continue to expand distribution through our go-to-market model. We increased total distribution points by 17% in 2024 and plan to further increase by an additional 40,000 points of distribution in 2025. This sets us up well for accelerated growth. As we look to 2025, marketing and innovation will be key enablers of our growth. Let's dive into both.\nFirst, on the marketing front, we continue to make meaningful advancements in talent, tools, and capabilities by building an ecosystem that fuels brand relevance and creative excellence. A key driver of this success is our in-house agency, The Kitchen, which we launched four years ago to unlock creativity and deliver breakthrough ideas at the speed of culture. Since its launch, The Kitchen has garnered external recognition, earning numerous awards for the in-house agency of the year. I am thrilled to share that our marketing team has been pushing the boundaries of innovation and creativity in the partnership space. We're not just talking about any partnership. We are talking about game-changing, culture-shifting collaborations that are redefining the marketing landscape. For example, we finally got Mustard on the Beat with our electric flying collaboration with the award-winning producer Mustard, which dropped during the biggest night in music, the Grammys.\nAnd if that wasn't enough, we also brought our beloved brands to life in Instacart's first-ever Super Bowl campaign, featuring the iconic Heinz Wiener Dogs, the Kool-Aid Man, and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. It was a moment that will go down in marketing history. These partnerships aren't just about generating buzz. They're about creating unforgettable experiences that leave a lasting impact on our consumers. And I couldn't be prouder of our team for their dedication to truly creating marketing that excites. Our Brand Growth System is another critical component of our creative ecosystem, providing a systematic and repeatable framework that complements our disruptive marketing and innovation efforts to drive brand superiority. You have heard that about the early success we've had with Heinz Ketchup in the UK and Philadelphia Cream Cheese in the US. Now, with this pilot complete, we are ready to scale.\nMore on that as we get into Candy next week. Turning to innovation, our strategy is working. We have significantly increased innovation as a percentage of our Organic Net Sales from 1.6% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2024. We are focused on creating and providing consumers with products that are worth paying for, whether that be through our cuisine and flavor exploration, high-quality convenience solutions, or expanding options and functionality through unique benefits. As part of our Mexican food strategy, we have expanded our Taco Bell partnership, providing our consumers with restaurant-quality experiences at home. In 2024, this led to dollar sales growth of 24%, and we increased market share by nearly a point. As consumers are looking for bolder, more exciting flavors, we are leveraging a flavor-focused expansion strategy in mac and cheese.\nBased on market and social media trends, we are creating buzzworthy moments by launching limited-time offerings to drive excitement and deliver unexpected new flavors to market in record time. This includes our most recent everything bagel Kraft Mac & Cheese launch, which sold out in just one day online at our one of our largest retailers. After 150 years, leveraging our extensive agricultural heritage and tomato expertise, we launched the first Heinz Pasta Sauce in the UK a couple of years ago. Now, we continue to introduce new recipes, disrupting and driving excitement in the pasta sauce category, making superior quality ingredients and delayed food trends accessible to all pasta lovers. It's working with dollar sales growth of 45% in 2024.\nBy leveraging a global Heinz team that was established last year, we are quickly scaling what works, expanding Heinz pasta sauce into other countries, including Brazil, Chile, and across Europe. And we are delivering deliciousness and convenience through a 360CRISP platform, pushing the boundaries of what frozen food can deliver. This patent technology provides convenience and quality, creating crispy products like those on the stove in a matter of minutes in the microwave. Delimex Quesadillas marked our first launch on the brand in over five years, and they are now available in over 20,000 stores as we continue to expand distribution. We entered 2025 with strong momentum on the innovation front, and we will continue to double down on innovation that worked well in 2024. In fact, over 75% of innovation sales in 2025 are expected to come from proven innovation already launched.\nPlus, we have an exciting array of launches ready for 2025, focused on our core brand. With that, let me hand it over to Andre to provide more details on our Q4 financial results and to discuss our 2025 outlook.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nGlobal CFO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Carlos. In the Q4, Organic Net Sales declined 3.1% for total Kraft Heinz, with price up 1 percentage point and volume mix down 4.1 percentage points. In North America, Organic Net Sales declined 3.6%, with growth in our Canada business offset by lower sales in both US retail and away from home. In our international developed markets, Organic Net Sales declined 4%. This was driven by volume pressures due to customer negotiations in Europe and declines in non-core categories. In emerging markets, Organic Net Sales was up 2.2%.\nResults were impacted by Brazil, driven primarily by volume elasticity linked to price taking in commodity categories, and China, where we continue to experience industry softness. The rest of emerging markets grew the top line double digits in the Q4, with particularly strong growth in the Middle East and Turkey. Turning to the next slide, total Kraft Heinz Adjusted Operating Income declined 0.3%, driven by declines in each of our zones, primarily due to lower sales. Our Adjusted Operating Income margin increased 80 basis points, a result of lower variable compensation and unlocked efficiencies. Lower variable compensation was a benefit to Adjusted Operating Income across each of our zones. In North America, Adjusted Operating Income declined 2.3% versus the prior year, with declining sales more than offsetting productivity gains.\nIn international developed markets, Adjusted Operating Income decreased 3.8%, primarily driven by the declining sales and incremental inflation, partially offset by operational efficiencies. In emerging markets, while Adjusted Operating Income declined 0.8% on a constant currency basis, we grew 3.5%, and Adjusted Operating Income margin expanded by 70 basis points. This growth and margin expansion was driven by lapping elevated investments in go-to-market, primarily in Latin. As we think about improving overall competitiveness in the market, we are leveraging a combination of strategies. We are focused on growing our base volumes in a sustainable way. This includes through consumer-driven innovation, portfolio renovation, marketing that matters, as well as selectively investing in price. In the Q4, our percent of volume sold on promotion was down 2% versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by lapping dynamics.\nIn Q4 2023, we were investing more in promotions on Ore-Ida as we were coming back from service issues, and in Philadelphia, we are lapping private label out of stocks. As we continue to balance long-term profitability, our volume sold on promotion was 5% below levels that of 2019. Looking to 2025, we are planning an increased level of investment in price. Remaining mindful of the consumer situation, we plan to make investments to adjust price gaps in selected categories, primarily across the four key brands Carlos discussed, and in our US away-from-home. While we'll be investing more, we are also taking actions to ensure we generate positive returns. We have additional opportunities identified for 2025 to remove non-effective events that were not driving top or bottom line in 2024.\nAs we know that promotions without product improvement and marketing will not get us to where we need to be. Moving down the P&L, we continue to generate margin expansion through end-to-end efficiencies. This helps us to not only offset inflation, but it also enables us to invest in the business to support long-term growth. In 2024, we generated nearly 4.5% of gross efficiencies as a percentage of cost of goods sold. This exceeds the target we had for the year, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $2.5 billion in efficiencies by 2027. With $1.3 billion unlocked to date, we have significant runway ahead to capture at least $1.2 billion more.\nThrough Agile at Scale, we have plans for further advancements, including but not limited to automation and network optimization in our supply chain, sourcing excellence within procurement, and maintaining a disciplined execution and continuous improvement mindset. These efficiencies helped generate 100 basis points of Adjusted Gross Profit Margin expansion in 2024 and provided us with the flexibility to increase investments. We exited 2024 with marketing as a percent of net sales at 4.5% and R&D as a percent of net sales at 0.6%. On the marketing front, we are approaching optimal levels and are shifting more focus in 2025 on unlocking additional value from our marketing spend through data-driven improvements to ROIs. We have plans in place that will optimize marketing mix across brands and media types to ensure our dollars are working hard for our brands.\nOn R&D, we expect to further increase our investments to support future innovation and are targeting levels closer to 1% of net sales. Turning to cash flow, we generated full-year Free Cash Flow conversion of 85%, a 4% point increase versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by the conversion of certain surplus plan assets related to the US post-retirement medical plan to cash, as well as improved working capital. At the same time, we continue to increase investments for growth, with full-year CapEx increasing to 4% of net sales, up 100 basis points from the prior year. In terms of Adjusted EPS, we grew 7.7%, or $0.06, versus the Q4 of 2023. This was driven by positive impacts from our lower effective tax rate and share repurchases.\nKeep in mind, our Adjusted EPS does exclude an impairment charge of $1.4 billion that was recognized in the quarter, which was more than offset by a $2.4 billion tax benefit. This tax benefit is related to the transfer of certain business operations that was completed in Q4 2024. The transfer was part of our planning for the changes in the international tax environment and also allowed us to achieve greater operational synergies. In accordance with GAAP, the P&L benefit from the transfer of certain business operations had to be recorded in Q4 2024 when the transfer was completed. On a cash tax basis, however, the benefit is recognized annually starting 2025 and going forward for the next 20 years. As a result, we expect a 500 basis points step-up in our P&L tax rate starting 2025.\nHowever, we only expect a 200 to 300 basis points step-up in our cash tax rate. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while returning capital to stockholders. In 2024, we maintain our net leverage target of three times, ending the year at 2.9 times. We believe this is a good level that provides us with optionality. We also return approximately $2.7 billion to stockholders, $1.9 billion to our competitive dividend with a yield that exceeds 5%, and $800 million through our share repurchase program. This leaves about $1.9 billion remaining against our $3 billion authorization. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is non-programmatic, a function of excess cash, and takes into consideration the macroeconomic environment. Now, turning to our Full-Year 2025 outlook, we are expecting Organic Net Sales in the range of down 2.5% to flat.\nThis includes full-year growth in our emerging markets and global away from home pillars, with an elongated recovery expected in US retail challenged categories. We expect Organic Net Sales in Q1 to come in lower relative to Q4 2024. This is driven primarily by an approximate 100 basis point headwind for total Kraft Heinz due to an Easter shift. As a result, we expect to see lighter sales in Q1, with an offset in Q2. The Q2 should also benefit from lapping pressures on Lunchables performance, and the temporary plant closure in Q2 2024, as well as increased investments in price and product. We then expect second half to gradually improve from Q2. Constant currency adjusted operating income is expected to be down 4% to down 1%.\nThis includes the impact of lapping lower variable compensation in 2024, which is an approximate 210 basis points headwind at the midpoint of our guidance. This also contemplates an Adjusted Gross Profit Margin that is flat to slightly positive year over year, driven by our gross efficiencies that are mostly offset by incremental investments in price and product. We expect Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.74. This reflects a $0.07 headwind versus the prior year from lower variable incentive compensation in 2024. Our Adjusted EPS expectation also contemplates an effective tax rate of approximately 26%, which is a $0.23 headwind on Adjusted EPS year over year. The step-up in our effective P&L tax rate is primarily related to the dynamics I noted earlier. As a reminder, this outlook does not reflect any impact from future potential share repurchases.\nFrom a Free Cash Flow perspective, we expect 2025 to be flat versus prior year, with Free Cash Flow conversion of approximately 95%. This is driven by working capital efficiencies and lower cash outflows for variable compensation, partially offset by the net cash impact of a higher tax rate. We also want to acknowledge that the macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain, particularly as it relates to potential tariffs, food regulations, changes to SNAP, and foreign exchange headwinds. Our current outlook does not contemplate significant worsening of these macroeconomic pressures. With that, I will pass it back to Carlos for some closing comments.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Andre. At Kraft Heinz, we're acting with urgency, building upon our proven ability to unlock efficiencies, benefiting from 2024 foundational accomplishments in our strategic pillars, and investing for the now and the near to support the next. We have established our ability to be an efficient operator.\nThrough the capabilities we have developed, due in large part to our agile ways of working, we are generating best-in-class efficiencies, with $1.3 billion captured to date, with line of sight to an additional $1.2 billion. These efficiencies, along with working capital improvements, have led to an increase in free cash flow conversion from 81% in 2023 to 85% in 2024, with expectations to increase to approximately 95% in 2025. Last year, our teams were busy laying a solid foundation for 2025. Our top-line improvements in the year will be driven by building upon the momentum of strategic growth drivers, leveraging initiatives already set in motion. Earlier, I talked about a couple of our successful innovation launches across Heinz, Mac & Cheese, and our Mexican strategy. As we think about 2025, over 75% of the forecasted sales from innovation will come from launches already proved out.\nIn away from home, I am excited to enter the year with 75% of expected sales from new customers' wins already locked in, and a strong line of sight to additional customer wins as we progress throughout the year. In emerging markets, we will continue to execute against our go-to-market model in both retail and away from home, building upon continued distribution gains. With significant white space and a proven plan in emerging markets, we have meaningful opportunities to continue to grow. And what really excites me is we completed two successful pilots of our Brand Growth System, although it's still early, we are seeing promising initial results across Philadelphia and Heinz in the UK. And in 2025, we will be investing for the now and near to support the next.\nWe are scaling our Brand Growth System, utilizing agile at scale ways to work and to grow our core must-win brands. This deep forensic-like assessment of our brands uncovers meaningful opportunities to invest in the product, ensuring that we are driving superiority on all fronts, delivering on consumer desires, and creating marketing that resonates with consumers. And importantly, we are dedicated to making these investments while protecting profits. We're also honing in on our sales capabilities, ensuring our products are available and visible wherever, whenever, and however a consumer wants. This includes strengthening our capabilities across our go-to-market model and joint business planning to drive further distribution and reach. All of this combined, along with our highest employee engagement yet, being named a great place to work in 22 countries, including in the US for the first time, gives me excitement headed into 2025.\nI know we got some work ahead of us to really drive growth. But I got to tell you, I am feeling pretty optimistic about the momentum we have built. We're making strides, and that's something to be excited about. As we look to the year ahead, I'm confident that we got the right strategy in place. We'll keep innovating, we'll stay focused, and we'll keep driving towards our goals. Together, I'm excited to see what we can achieve. Thank you for your time and interest in Kraft Heinz.",

Welcome to The Kraft Heinz Company Second Quarter Results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you and hello everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, head of global investor relations at The Kraft Heinz Company. Welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2024 business update. During today's call we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy efforts and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.\nAdditionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. I will now hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer Carlos Abrams-Rivera for opening comments. Carlos, over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Recognizing that it remains a difficult consumer environment, I am proud that we at Kraft Heinz are providing high quality, convenient solutions that are of great value, brand worth paying for, and we will continue to stay focused on renovating and innovating with new benefits, functionality, and accessibility. At the same time, our teams have been relentless in unlocking efficiencies with a mindset of continuous improvements, and as a result of greater productivity and efficiencies, we have been able to hold prices below inflation this year while continuing to invest in innovation, marketing, and R&D, and for our stockholders. Through our dividend and share repurchases, we have returned over $1.5 billion in capital so far this year. I am very encouraged on how our focus on improving working capital is paying off.\nWe increased free cash flow nearly $100 million, or approximately 9%, compared to last year and maintain our targeted leverage ratio. Finally, it is hard to believe that it has only been four months since my leadership team came together. We're on this journey together, all committed to driving improvements and achieving our company dream. I see the ownership and grit with my direct reports and across the organization. We're all embracing this new operating model and ways of working, and we are only getting stronger and stronger. With that, I have Andre joining me. So let's open the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. One moment for questions.\nOur first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGreat.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for the question. Good morning everybody.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nCarlos, you mentioned the need for selective promotion and trade spend activity in the second half just to drive better volume results for, you know, a more value seeking consumer. I'm curious if there's a way to dimensionalize the portion or the percentage of sales that are sort of in need of some adjustments and if there are any particular hotspots that require maybe more aggressive pricing actions or sort of a reset of sorts. Basically I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad the price point issue really is across the portfolio with the understanding that as you've talked about, promotional right now are still below those you saw in 2019.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndrew, why don't you start an hour complimentary.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAgain Andrew, thanks for the question.\nLook, we, as we said in our.\nGuidance, we're contemplating a step up in trade investment level. You saw that in Q2. We already had a little more trade than what we had in the last year, though we're still well below 2019 levels. We believe that, looking forward, we are more focused on those price gaps versus branded competitors and in places where it makes sense for the long term.\nWe have been saying all along, and we continue to stick to this, that we believe that's the way they want to grow their business is not through over-relying on promotions and rather continue to invest behind our innovation, our renovation, and our market investments. And that's what we have been doing and we're sticking to that. We are confident about that into the future. But in the short term we are seeing selected spots where it does make sense to add promotions to close those gaps. I'm not going to give you like overly precise number to your question, but I estimate in the 30% to 40% of the portfolio where those price gaps require some incremental level of investment in the US.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nReally, really helpful.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYep.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThen just a really quick one. Do you anticipate volume inflecting to positive in the back half? Because I think by our math it's still implied that that's the case even by the new guidance range. I guess how do you see volume progress playing out specifically in North America in the second half?\nThanks again.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWe do expect revenue and volume to gradually improve throughout the quarters. In our midpoint of the new guidance, we don't have, we don't need volume to grow for us to achieve our guidance. So our price expected to be in the around 1% territory for the total portfolio. So if you think about the second half, what's implied in the guidance is sales declining 0.5%. And so there you can see. Now the good thing is volumes in emerging markets, despite some headwinds in Brazil and China, continue to be positive. They were positive to the second quarter. They continue to be so year-to-date. And in the US we're going to be expected to have volume continue to improve. But again in our midpoint, we don't need the volumes to turn to positive for us to achieve it.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWhat I would say to add is also giving me confidence. We think about that trajectory improving in the second half is that we are very much focused on driving that value and very much in a sustainable way. So it cannot just be value for the sake of value, but delivering value in a sustainable way through innovation, renovation, and marketing for, frankly, families that we know are spending more time cooking at home. So when you see some of our innovation around things like Mac and cheese, where we're bringing new shapes, new flavors, and new pack size to consumers at different price points. When you see us bringing new Mexican solutions with Taco Bell and Delimex, that allows us to again bring families solutions for their home when they're spending more time together.\nThat is part of us kind of bringing new ideas and ways in which we can bring value to families at this particular time. We're seeing that also away from home business where we continue to see the improvements on the momentum of the business. We are seeing the improvements that we are now servicing better going into Q3. We are also getting new customers in away from home business that again help us make sure that we're building on the success we've had in the past. As Andre said, we are being selective in our investments in trade, but we're also committed to a disciplined approach to the RGM tools that we have used in the past and we know that help us make sure that we continue to make a balance on the profitability of how we spend in a smart way.\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nJust a final comment is I think our updated guidance also reflects this philosophy and this approach because you see we have adjusted our net sales guidance down, but we largely kept our EBIT growth, and we kept fully capped our EPS growth. So that's what we are sticking for. We have been very disciplined in being very thoughtful about the type of investments we make and what are the long-term implications of that, and we're going to continue to do so.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Just sticking on the subject of the back half, you provided a number of reasons for optimism. I think you've cited more innovation, renovation, and marketing. You've talked about expanded distribution in certain parts of the business, and then, of course, those targeted promotions. Just as we think about these drivers plus the absence of the plant maintenance headwind, which are you counting on as being the most important and meaningful to hitting your updated outlook. Do the promos have to work? Is it really about innovation? Striking a note with consumer, I just want to get a better idea of kind of your visibility and reliance on the factors you're talking about. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you for your question, Ken. You know, I think frankly it depends a little bit on the region of the world. I think if you think about our emerging markets, as Andre pointed out we have been growing volume. We continue to see improvements as we go into the second half of the year, and already we exited June in a much better way than we had for the whole quarter. So we are seeing that in that case distribution gains that we have invested in our go to market strategy. Emerging markets is working, and we continue to build those success we've had in the past in an away from home business.\nIt really is us continue to drive the improvements on our service given our planned closure that we had in Q2, and also continue to start winning and winning some customers that we in fact already have qualified for us in the second half of the year, and that is both globally in the US and outside the US. So we are not expecting a big improvement in the overall situation in away from home in the US, but what we do expect is that we are in fact continue to see the progress and our distribution gains as we go forward and in the US. And North America for all is really driven by this balance between us driving this innovation renovation of our brands.\nTruly being more thoughtful about the value that we're creating with consumers in terms of the better products, the better ideas that we bring into market, as well as being thoughtful on how we are going to spend on our revenue management tools, spread our revenue management tools in order for us to make sure that we are having the right price gaps in the intended fashion against the branded competitors. So that would give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about the overall portfolio and anything you wanted to add?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nNo, I think I covered.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thank you. Thank you.\nGood morning. You called out a couple of overseas markets, specifically the UK, China, and Brazil. Different dynamics in each of those markets. But obviously a lot of work going on as you try to correct trade gap or, sorry, price gaps in the UK and fight through consumer demand softness in China and Brazil.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI guess, could you just, you know.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nExpand on what you're seeing in those markets and.\nMaybe a bit more color on what your expectations are for the back half in terms of any kinds of sequential improvement?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure.\nI think maybe starting with the.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nUK.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAs we said last year in earnings, is a place that suffer a significant amount of inflation, probably even less, even more than other developed markets, and private label in that particular market start to get a lot of traction. We decided in Q3 last year to start to step up investments to protect the volume. We do have some factories in the UK that's also need to be mindful about the utilization of those factories and protect the volume for some of the strong brands we have over there. We have put that in place since now almost a year ago, and we have seen the returns happening on the volume share side. So I think we're moving the right direction, and we are able to mostly protect even gross margin because of the amount of efficiency that we have generated there.\nSo, UK, I think, is moving in the right direction when it comes to China. Similar to what you have heard from others, the industry continues to be soft. I mean, that's the expectations that we do have about a country like China. So we continue to gain market share in modern trade. So that's a good thing. But the industry is just not working. And I think we actually reset our expectation moving forward, at least for the short term, about China. Industry growth in Brazil.\nThe good thing is you continue to gain market share. So that's being very consistent, and we feel good about that. Consumer has been demonstrating, similar to other parts of the world, fatigue and has been showing also vulnerability. So we saw some price gaps to branded players for private label that is negligible also coming down.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo we had to invest.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nBut we face a situation where the customers adjusted their inventory down. You have to understand that in emerging markets, retailers tend to carry more inventory than in developed markets. So in a country like Brazil, you see inventory is at the 45, 50 days level compared to the US where you see 20 days, 25 days. So it's very different. And what we have seen, a situation like we are right now, high interest rates, consumer tightness, is retailers to adjust their inventories down. Honestly, we are not expecting that. That created.\nA challenge for us in Brazil in the first half of the year. We believe that inventories, we believe right now that they should be at the appropriate level, which should allow us to improve the situation. But that's a little bit of a snapshot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question.\nCarlos. I wanted to come back to North America.\nYour portfolio in a lot of your categories, you're not the highest priced product, and you'd think there should be some benefit from trade down into your brands.\nBut with the focus on managing price.\nGaps to other brands. It also seems like the equation is still very much price based.\nSo at this point, how do you?\nfeel about the ability to redefine your portfolio through innovation, marketing, where you can better compete on non-price factors?\nBecause it feels like there's already been.\nA lot of work done with ingredient reformulations and so on. How do you think about the non-price competition?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah, well, first of all, thank you for the question. And as you pointed out, we have a series of iconic brands across our portfolio in North America that we feel great about. And you've seen that already. I mean, you've seen brands from Philadelphia to Ore-Ida where you are seeing the growth as we have continued to renovate those businesses, as well as the success that we've had in a brand like Jell-O where we have continued to renovate. So we have a playbook on how we continue to renovate our business, our brands to make sure they in fact continue to be resonating with consumers today and for the future.\nI think in places where we are seeing that consumers are making choices as they are trying to manage the cash flow of the family, we also have to be aware that we have to provide consumers options at different price points so they can be part of the overall basket size of the cash flow that they have available to them. That's why in a business like Mac and Cheese, well, it's certainly something that can fit the entire, can feed the entire family. We want to make sure we have different price points in which we can come in to consumers and allow them to make sure they continue to enjoy our products. It's also about us being able to be accessible in new places.\nOne of the things we find right now is that consumers are actually increasing the number of trips and locations in which they shop. So for us it's important that we continue to expand where consumers are going to find our brands and why we have been so much focused on driving our improvements in terms of distribution in the dollar channel. Whether that is with our Oscar Mayer businesses and making sure that we have the product they're looking for at that particular venue. But it's also us expanding our distribution in places like Club where we know consumers are also looking for different ways in which we can find value for their family. So for us it's applying the playbook that we have from renovating and innovating and at the same time making sure we have providing the access to families as they're shopping in new spaces.\nWhether they're going from a dollar store to grocery to club and our brands.\nContinue to be there.\nThose are all things that you'll see us continue to add as we go forward into the second half of the year.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nThank you, Carlos.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\nGood morning.\nJust was wondering in away-from-home, maybe two things. You called out that it had the 2.1% decline globally. Obviously you had the plant closure and some discontinuations. Can you unpack maybe the components there and give a sense of how much the slower foot traffic was a headwind?\nOr you know.\nWhat's the growth rate?\nWas excluding those kind of one-time.\nThings, and you know, maybe how much.\nWas from slower foot traffic.\nAnd then also, you've given an update.\nIn the past, on the HEINZ REMIX launch in BurgerFi, the test, and just curious how that's progressing there.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndrew, you want to start?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure.\nSo our global away from home business.\nDeclined 2.1% in the quarter, and the impact from the plant closure is about 200 basis points. Meaning that we will be flat without that effect. That will put us in a situation of similar performance to Q1 if you remove the plant closure effect. The planned exits that we had at the end of last year, they had an impact in the quarter of roughly 150 basis points.\nSo we'll be then growing 1.5. So we're still gapped versus a long term algo. We have been gaining, sustaining share again if you remove the effect from the plant closure. What we saw in Q2 in the industry within the categories that we play in is that industry was worse in Q2 than in Q1, which I think we were not really expecting that. So in the US about 100 basis points softer in Q2 versus Q1. So I think that the performance on our side helped to offset part of that headwind that happened in Q2.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. And then to your question about, you know, our equipment strategy is pretty comprehensive in terms of how we think about bringing innovation but also solving pain points for the operators in away-from-home. So the Heinz Remix today we have that already in market, and the way I think about it is it is really a moment for us to do the trial, making sure we get the learning from that so that we can scale that in a meaningful way in 2025. And so far we're hearing great feedback from operators, we're collecting a number of data from consumers, and we're seeing how that actually allows us to even improve as we think about how we are going to deploy this further in 2025.\nThe interesting thing too is that, you know, initially we thought this would be something that people would be using mostly in their burgers. We actually are seeing them using other foods as well when they see that in their, in their different QSRs. Now beyond the Heinz Remix, we also have been focusing on bringing new dispensers, taps, and vending into the pipeline. And again it's part of us thinking about, more comprehensive about how do we solve those pain points for operators. So our dispensers for example, that are much easier for operators to clean and it allows us to actually make sure that they reduce the amount of labor involved in the collecting and changing of the dispensers they began shipping to customers now in Q2.\nWe believe that actually it's going to continue to improve distribution as we go into the second half of the year, and already beginning to get much more distribution than we had originally expected. You'll see you continue to now drive some of the learning that we began in the US globally as well as we continue to then bring more of those tabs and vending ideas into the marketplace.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for the question. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore. You may proceed.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\nJust looking ahead. Good morning. Looking ahead in US Retail and you're looking to stabilize things there. Thanks for the commentary earlier on volume and pricing. How are you thinking about improvement across the portfolio and what we're going to be seeing in the scanner data? You've called out Capri Sun and Lunchables as two areas that might improve, that are turnaround situations. Those are down, certainly, the most, but that doesn't necessarily mean those are the biggest areas of improvement that you're anticipating. How are you thinking about which brands and which categories will improve the most in the second half?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me start, and then what I will say is we called those out because they were, you know, a meaningful headwind for us and in our Q2. I think it's something that the teams have done an amazing job of making sure that we have the right plans as we go forward. I mean, it was meaningful to the point that in the case of Lunchables we saw from a low point of, I would say, down 17%, the worst week in the Q2 where we have actually seen a steady recovery since that particular point. We're building that improvement, and the teams are getting ready both in terms of renovating, innovating, doubling the marketing spend, improving the media mix, improving the targeting strategies, and increasing the value equation for the consumers as we go forward. That includes innovation.\nSome of it we included already in some of the slides that you saw. But also we have other innovations that for competitive reasons we're not including yet. But they will be coming in the second half of the year as well. Plus we continue to expand in the Lunchables with fruit partnership with Del Monte in the second half of the year. So there is a meaningful amount of program that is supporting our Lunchables. And you see that, and you begin to see that really coming to fruition in our back-to-school program when we're teaming up with the Transformers movie as something that frankly we have been successful in the past of doing movie tie-ins as we have done with the Heinz brand.\nWe did point out as well Capri Sun because again, it was a minimal headwind for us in the second quarter that again the teams have been very much focused on driving a change on trajectory as we go to the second half of the year. They have renovated the original Capri Sun to better align with the consumer taste preference, invested twice the marketing as we go into 2023 versus 2023. We have secured strong Back-to-School displays with customers, we have invested in the right promotional events, and we have expanded into new channels with Club. So again, it are both places where we have seen some meaningful headwind in the Q2 that we now have also just a meaningful reaction in terms of improving that trajectory as we go forward. And that will continue with the other things that are working for us.\nWe do have some positive momentum in parts of our accelerated platform. I mentioned Ore-Ida, which is gaining almost a share point. Our Mexican business also gaining 80 basis points. Cream cheese business has sustained growth through the entire first half of the year. So those are businesses that we'll continue to see gain momentum as we go into the second half of the year.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for that. I think we should expect Mac and Cheese as well. I think there is a lot going on in the Mac and Cheese in the second half. Might be worse.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. You know, I think that if I think about how do I round up the items in our accelerated platforms, you know, there's probably two areas in which we feel like, you know, we also have to be focused on and we are. One is our spoonable business in which we are in fact making sure that we are having the right brand price gaps against our branded competitors. So we are investing in new flavors and making sure we are renovating the package design on a spoonable business. And in Mac and cheese, as you saw from our slides, you saw us making sure that we bring in again new innovation, new shapes, new flavors, and tie in now with Super Mario Bros.\nSo that idea of us being able to bring innovation and excitement into the Mac and cheese business is part of us continue to see us improving the momentum of that business. We go into the second half of the year, which we know is a product that families really care about in moments in which they're looking for value to feed their entire family.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat. I was going to follow up and ask you about condiments and sauces and in particular the spoonables area like you discussed. But you covered it. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator. We have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks for the question, Andre and Carlos. I think one of the concerns on Kraft Heinz stock is that all this great progress you've made on gross margin recovery might come under pressure over the next 12 months because you have to make some of these price investments and because volume has been weak. So maybe to address those, can you talk to what would gross margin have been in Q2 excluding some of these one-time issues like the plant closure and the.\nThe other elements that maybe are more transitory. Could this have been an even higher number and would that kind of give us confidence therefore that you know, there's more room for gross margin expansion into 2025?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nHi Rob, thanks for the question.\nLook, in both Q1 and Q2, we did have a few situations that negatively impacted gross margin, like very one-time in nature. I'll be reluctant to give you a precise percentage point, but we did have quite a few substantial events in Q2, and despite that, we were able to expand the way that we did as you head into the second half. Last year we had a big step up in gross margin in the second half. So you're going to see a more muted year-over-year impact from gross margin.\nBut that's part of the plan since the beginning. So we're not really worried about that as we head in 2025. I'm not going to give guidance obviously, but if you remember our long term algorithm, we do contemplate continuous gross margin extension, not in the level that we are seeing right now, but in the 25 to 75 basis points ish. But as a consequence of the very strong efficiency that they have, I think we were able to fix the supply chain now a few years ago, and we have now for four consecutive years in very strong delivery. Coming from the team, we feel very good about the pipeline that we have.\nWe have been able this year to not only remember we had a 3% inflation this year. We only pricing 1% and we were able to offset that with efficiencies and still expand gross margin to invest in the business. So we do expect that this equation might continue to work into the future. So we should expect a more gradual but continuous gross margin expansion.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe only thing I would build, Rob, is this idea of us really changing the rewiring of the company where we are all focused on driving efficiency because it's the fuel for us to drive profitable growth, has now been embedded across the company. You see that with procurement, you see in operation, but you also see in marketing, on us being able to have more efficiencies of how we go to market, improving the return on investment. You see that in trade, on how we apply AI to have better tools, on how we actually have better investments and profitable ways in which we can embed our trade as we go into the marketplace. So it is not a one-and-done. It is something that we believe can be a sustainable strength for us as a company.\nPersonally, I believe that having healthy gross margin is truly the key component of having a virtuous cycle of growth, and that is a big part of why we are so strong believers on a long-term algorithm for the company.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe changes in operating model that you have done a couple of years ago to really reintegrate commercial and supply chain, I think, are really paying off big time. The incentive alignment that you have done, we mentioned it before, like everyone in the company has two KPIs in common with market share and gross margin because we want people to grow profitably. So I think that also contributes to that.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOkay, thank you everyone. Thank you for your interest in Kraft Heinz.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you and hello everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at Kraft Heinz. Welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2024 business update. During today's call we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy efforts and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.\nAdditionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures which excludes certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events. For a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures, I will now hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, for opening comments. Carlos, over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Recognizing that it remains a difficult consumer environment, I am proud that we at Kraft Heinz are providing high quality, convenient solutions that are great value brand worth paying for. We will continue to stay focused on renovating and innovating with new benefits, functionality, and accessibility. At the same time, our teams have been relentless in unlocking efficiencies with a mindset of continuous improvements. As a result of greater productivity and efficiencies, we have been able to hold prices below inflation this year while continuing to invest in innovation, marketing, and R&D. For our stockholders through our dividend and share repurchases we have returned over $1.5 billion in capital so far this year. I am very encouraged on how our focus on improving working capital is paying off.\nWe increased free cash flow nearly $100 million or approximately 9% compared to last year and maintain our targeted leverage ratio. Finally, it is hard to believe that it has only been four months since my leadership team came together. We're on this journey together, all committed to driving improvements and achieving our company dream. I see the ownership and grit with my direct reports and across the organization. We're all embracing this new operating model and ways of working, and we are only getting stronger and stronger. With that, I have Andre joining me. So let's open the call for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. One moment for questions.\nOur first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. He may proceed.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks for the question. Good morning everybody.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nCarlos, you mentioned the need for selective promotion and trade spend activity in the second half just to drive better volume results for a more value seeking consumer. I'm curious if there's a way to dimensionalize the portion or the percentage of sales that are sort of in need some adjustments, and if there are any particular hotspots that require maybe more aggressive pricing actions or sort of a reset of sorts. Basically, I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad the price point issue really is across the portfolio with the understanding that, as you've talked about, promotional right now are still below those you saw in 2019.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndre, why don't you start.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAnd to comment again, Andrew, thanks for the question.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLook, as we said in our.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGuidance, we're contemplating a step up in trade investment level. You saw that in Q2. We already had a little more trade than what we had in the last year, though we're still well below 2019 levels. We believe that looking forward, we are more focused on those price gaps versus branded competitors, and in places where it makes sense for the long term.\nWe have been saying all along, and we continue to stick to this, that we believe that the way they want to grow the business is not through over relying on promotions and rather continue to invest behind our innovation, our renovation, and our market investments. And that's what we have been doing and we're sticking to that. We are confident about that into the future. But in the short term we are seeing selected spots where it does make sense to add promotions to close those gaps. I'm not going to give you like overly precise number to your question, but I estimate in the 30% to 40% of the portfolio where those price gaps require some incremental level of investment.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nIn the US.\nIn the US you probably really, really helpful.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYep.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThen just a really quick one. Do you anticipate volume inflecting to positive in the back half? Because I think by our math it's still implied that that's the case even by the new guidance range. I guess how do you see volume progress playing out specifically in North America in the second half?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks again.\nWe do expect revenue and volume to gradually improve throughout the quarters in our midpoint of the new guidance. We don't need volume to grow for us to achieve our guidance. So our pricing expected to be in around 1% territory for the total portfolio. So if you think about the second half, what's part of the guidance is sales declining 0.5%.\nSo, there you can see, now the good thing is volumes in emerging markets, despite some headwinds in Brazil and China, continue to be positive. They were positive in Q2. They continue to be so year to date. And in the US, we're going to be expected to have volume continue to improve. But again, in our midpoint, we don't need the volumes to turn to positive for us to achieve it.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWhat I would say to add is also gives me confidence [as] we think about that trajectory improving in the second half is that, you know, we are very much focused on driving that value [and] very much in a sustainable way. So it cannot just be value for the sake of value, but delivering value in this sustainable way through innovation, renovation, and marketing for frankly families that we know are spending more time cooking at home. So when you see some of our innovation around things like Mac and cheese, where we're bringing new shapes, new flavors, new pack size to consumers at different price points, when you see us bringing new Mexican solutions with Taco Bell and Delimex, that allows us to again bring families solutions for their home when they're spending more time together.\nThat is part of us kind of bringing new ideas and ways in which we can bring value to families at this particular time. And we're seeing that also in away from home business, where we continue to see the improvements on the momentum of the business. We are seeing the improvements that we are now servicing better going into Q3. We are also getting new customers in away from home business that again help us make sure that we're building on the success we've had in the past. And as Andre said, we are being selective in our investments in trade, but we're also committed to a disciplined approach to the RGM tools that we have used in the past. And we know that help us make sure that we continue to make a balance on the profitability on how we spend in a smart way.\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nJust a final comment is, I think our data guidance also reflects this philosophy and this approach because, you see, we have adjusted our net sales guidance down, but we largely kept our EBIT growth, and we kept fully capture EPS growth. So that's what we are sticking for. We have been very disciplined in being very thoughtful about the type of investments we make and what are the long-term implications of that, and we're going to continue to do so.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Just sticking on the subject of the back half, you provided a number of reasons for optimism. I think you've cited more innovation, renovation, and marketing. You've talked about expanded distribution in certain parts of the business and then of course those targeted promotions. Just as we think about these drivers, plus the absence of the plant maintenance headwind, which are you counting on as being the most important and meaningful to hitting your updated outlook. Do the promos have to work? Is it really about innovation? Striking a note with consumer, I just want to get a better idea of kind of your visibility and reliance on the factors you're talking about. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you for your question, Ken. You know, I think frankly it depends a little bit on the region of the world. I think if you think about our emerging markets, as Andre pointed out, we have been growing volume. We continue to see improvements as we go into the second half of the year, and already we exited June in a much better way than we had for the whole quarter. So we are seeing that, in that case, distribution gains that we have invested in our go-to-market strategy, emerging markets is working, and we continue to build those successes we've had in the past in an away-from-home business.\nIt really is us continue to drive the improvements on our service given our planned closure that we had in Q2 and also continue to start winning and winning some customers that we in fact already have qualified for us in the second half of the year. That is both globally, in the US and outside the US. We are not expecting a big improvement in the overall situation in away-from-home in the US, but what we do expect is that we are in fact continue to see the progress in our distribution gains as we go forward in the US and North America.\nFor all, it's really driven by this balance between us driving this innovation renovation of our brands, truly being more thoughtful about the value that we're creating with consumers in terms of the better products, the better ideas that we're bringing to market, as well as being thoughtful on how we are going to spend on our revenue management tools, spread our tools in order for us to make sure that we are having the right price gaps in the intended fashion against the branded competitors. So that should give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about the overall portfolio and anything you wanted to add?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nNo, I think we.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning.\nYou called out a couple of overseas.\nMarkets, specifically the UK, China, and Brazil. Different dynamics in each of those markets. But obviously a lot of work going on as you try to correct trade gaps or sorry, price gaps in the UK and fight through consumer demand softness in China and Brazil. I guess could you just expand on what you're seeing in those markets and?\nMaybe a bit more color on what your expectations are for the back half in terms of any kinds of sequential improvement?\n\nOperator\n\nSure.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo, I think maybe starting with the.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nUK.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAs we said last year in earnings is a place that suffered a significant amount of inflation, probably even more than other developed markets, and private label in that particular market start to get a lot of traction, and we decided in Q3 last year to start to step up investments to protect the volume. We do have some factories in the UK that also need to be mindful about the utilization of those factories and protect volume for some of the strong brands we have over there. We have put that in place since now almost a year ago, and we have seen the returns happening on the volume share side. So I think we're moving the right direction, and we are able to mostly protect even gross margin because of the amount of efficiency that we have generated there.\nSo, UK, I think, is moving in the right direction when it comes to China. Similar to what you have heard from others, the industry continues to be soft, I mean, versus the expectations that we do have about a country like China. So we continue to gain market share in modern trade. So that's a good thing. But the industry is just not working. And I think we actually set our expectation moving forward, at least for the short term. About China. Industry growth in Brazil.\nThe good thing is you continue to gain market share. So that's being very consistent, and we feel good about that. Consumer has been demonstrating, similar to other parts of the world, fatigue and has been showing also vulnerability. So we saw some price gaps to branded players for Private Label that is negligible also coming down. So we had to invest. But we face a situation where the customers adjusted their inventory down. You have to understand that in emerging markets, retailers tend to carry more inventory than in developed markets. So in a country like Brazil, you see inventories at the 45- to 50-days level compared to the US where you see 20 days, 25 days. So it's very different. And what we have seen in a situation like we are right now, high interest rates, consumer tightness, is retailers to adjust their inventories down.\nHonestly we are not expecting that. And that created.\nA challenge for us in Brazil in the first half of the year. We believe that inventories, we believe right now that they should be at the appropriate level which should allow us to improve the situation. But yeah, that's a little bit of snapshot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for the question.\nCarlos, I wanted to come back to North America. Your portfolio, in a lot of your categories, you're not the highest priced product. You'd think there should be some benefit from trade down into your brands.\nBut with the focus on managing price.\nGaps to other brands. It also seems like the equation is still very much price based.\nSo, at this point, how do you?\nFeel about the ability to redefine your portfolio through innovation marketing where you can better compete on non-price factors?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nBecause it feels like there's already been.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nA lot of work done with ingredient reformulations and so on. How do you think about the non-price competition?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz",
    "content2": "Yeah, well, first of all, thank you for the question. And as you pointed out, we have a series of iconic brands across our portfolio in North America that we feel great about. And you've seen that already. I mean, you've seen brands from Philadelphia to Ore-Ida, where you are seeing the growth as we have continued to renovate those businesses, and the success that we've had in a brand like Jell-O, where we have continued to renovate. So we have a playbook on how we continue to renovate our business, our brands, to make sure they in fact continue to be resonating with consumers today and for the future.\nI think in places where we are seeing that consumers are making choices as they are trying to manage the cash flow of the family, we also have to be aware that we have to provide consumers options at different price points so they can be part of their own basket size of the cash flow that they have available to them. That's why in a business like Mac and cheese, well, it's certainly something that can feed the entire family. We want to make sure we have different price points in which we can come in to consumers and allow them to make sure they continue to enjoy our products. It's also about us being able to be accessible in new places.\nOne of the things we find right now is that consumers are actually increasing the number of trips and locations in which they shop. So for us, it's important that we continue to expand where consumers are going to find our brands and why we have been so much focused on driving our improvements in terms of distribution in the Dollar Channel, whether that is with our Oscar Mayer businesses and making sure that we have the products they're looking for at that particular venue. But it's also us expanding our distribution in places like Club, where we know consumers are also looking for different ways in which we can find value for their family.\nSo for us, it's applying the playbook that we have from renovating and innovating, and at the same time making sure we're providing the access to families as they're shopping in new spaces, whether they're going from a dollar store to grocery to club, and our brands continue to be there. Those are all things that you'll see us continue to add as we go forward into the second half of the year.\nThank you, Carlos, thank you for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning.\nJust was wondering in away-from-home, maybe two things. You called out that it had the 2.1% decline globally. Obviously you had the plant closure and some discontinuations. Can you unpack maybe the components there and give a sense of how much the slower foot traffic was a headwind or you know.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWhat the growth rate was excluding those kind of one-time things and, you know, maybe how much.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nWas from slower foot traffic.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAnd then also you've given an update.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nIn the past on the Remix launch.\n\nOperator\n\nIn BurgerFi, the test, and just curious.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHow that's progressing there?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndrew, you want to start?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. So our global away from home business declined 2.1% in the quarter, and the impact from the plant closure is about 200 basis points. So meaning that we will be flat without that effect. That will put us in a situation of similar performance to Q1 if you remove the plant closure effect.\nThe planned exits that we had at the end of last year, they had an impact in the quarter of roughly 150 basis points.\nSo we'll be then growing 1.5. So we're still gapped versus a long-term goal. We have been gaining, sustaining share. Again, if you remove the effect from the plant closure. What we saw in Q2 in the industry is, in the categories that where we play, is that industry was worse in Q2 than in Q1, which I think we were not really expecting that. So in the US, about 100 basis points softer in Q2 versus Q1. So I think that the performance on our side helped to offset part of that headwind that happened in Q2.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. Then to your question about, you know, our equipment strategy is pretty comprehensive in terms of how we think about bringing innovation but also solving pain points for the operators in away from home. So the Heinz Remix today we have that already in market, and the way I think about it is it is really a moment for us to do the trial making sure we get the learning from that so that we can scale that in a meaningful way in 2025. And so far we're hearing great feedback from operators, we're collecting a number of data from consumers, and we're seeing how that actually allows us to even improve as we think about how we are going to deploy this further in 2025. The interesting thing too is that initially we thought this would be something that people would be using mostly in their burgers.\nWe actually are seeing them using other foods as well when they see that in their different QSRs. Now, beyond the Heinz Remix, we also have been focusing on bringing new dispensers, taps, and blending into the pipeline. Again, it's part of us thinking about more comprehensive about how do we solve those pain points for operators. So, our dispensers, for example, that are much easier for operators to clean, and it allows us to actually make sure that they reduce the amount of labor involved in the collecting and changing of the dispensers. They began shipping to customers now in Q2. We believe that actually it's going to continue to improve distribution as we go into the second half of the year, and already beginning to get much more distribution than we had originally expected.\nSo you'll see we continue to now drive some of the learning that we began in the US globally, as well as we continue to then bring more of those taps and vending ideas into the marketplace. Thanks for the question.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore. You may proceed.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThanks.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nJust looking ahead. Good morning. Looking ahead in US Retail, and you're looking to stabilize things there. Thanks for the commentary earlier on volume and pricing. But how are you thinking about improvement across the portfolio, and what we're going to be seeing in the scanner data? You've called out Capri Sun and Lunchables as two areas that might improve, that are turnaround situations. Those are down certainly the most, but that doesn't necessarily mean those are the biggest areas of improvement. How are you thinking about which brands and which categories will improve the most in the second half?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me start. Then what I will say is we called those out because they were a meaningful headwind for us in Q2. I think it's something that the teams have done an amazing job of making sure that we have the right plans as we go forward. I mean, it was meaningful to the point that in the case of Lunchables, we saw from a low point of, I would say, down 17%, the worst week in Q2 where we have actually seen a steady recovery since that particular point. We're building that improvement and the teams are getting ready both in terms of renovating, innovating, doubling the marketing spend, improving the media mix, improving the targeting strategies, and increasing the value equation for the consumers as we go forward. That includes, you know, innovation.\nSome of it we included already in some of the slides that you saw. But also we have other innovations that for competitive reasons we're not including yet. But they will be coming in the second half of the year as well. Plus we continue to expand the Lunchables with fruit in partnership with Del Monte in the second half of the year. So there is a meaningful amount of program there supporting our Lunchables. And you see that, and you begin to see that really coming to fruition in our back-to-school program. When we're teaming up with the Transformers movie as something that frankly we have been successful in the past doing movie tie-ins as we have done with the Heinz brand.\nAnd we did point out as well Capri Sun because again it was a meaningful headwind for us in the second quarter that again the teams have been very much focused on driving a change on trajectory as we go to the second half of the year. They have renovated the original Capri Sun to better align with the consumer taste preference, invested twice the marketing as we go into 2023 versus 2023. We have secured strong Back-to-School displays with customers, we have invested in the right promotional events, and we have expanded into new channels with Club. So again it are both places where we have seen some meaningful headway in the Q2 that we now have also just a meaningful reaction in terms of improving our trajectory as we go forward, and that will continue with the other things that are working for us.\nWe do have some positive momentum in parts of our accelerated platform. I mentioned Ore-Ida, which is gaining almost a share point. Our Mexican business also gaining 80 basis points. Philadelphia business has sustained growth through the entire first half of the year. So those are business that we'll continue to see gain the momentum as we go into the second half of the year.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI think we should expect Mac and cheese as well. I think there is a lot going on in the Mac and cheese in the second half. It might be worth.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah, I think that if I think about how I round up the items in our accelerated platforms. There are probably two areas in which we feel like we also have to be focused on, and we are. One is on a spoonable business in which we are in fact making sure that we are having the right brand price gaps against our branded competitors. So we are investing in new flavors and making sure we have renovated the package design on a spoonable business and in Mac and cheese, as you saw from our slides. You saw us making sure that we bring in again new.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nInnovation, new shapes, new flavors, tie in.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nNow with Super Mario Bros. So that idea of us being able to bring innovation and excitement into the Mac and cheese business is part of us continue to see us improving the momentum of that business. We go into the second half of the year, which we know is a product that families really care about in moments in which they're looking for value to feed their entire family.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGreat.\nI was going to follow up and ask you about condiments and sauces, and in particular the spoonables area like you discussed, but you covered it. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thanks for the question, Andre and Carlos. I think one of the concerns on Kraft Heinz stock is that all this great progress you've made on gross margin recovery might come under pressure over the next 12 months because you have to make some of these price investments and because volume has been weak. So maybe to address those, can you talk to what would gross margin have been in Q2 excluding some of these one-time issues like you know, the plant closure and the.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOther elements that maybe are more transitory, could this have been an even higher number and would that kind of give us confidence therefore that, you know, there's more room for gross margin expansion into 2025?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nHi Rob, thanks for the question.\nLook, in both Q1 and Q2 we did have a few situations that negatively impacted gross margin, like very one-time in nature. I'll be reluctant to give you a precise percentage point, but we did have quite a few substantial events in Q1 and Q2, and despite that we were able to expand the way that we did. As you head into the second half, last year we had a big step up in gross margin in the second half. So you're going to see a more muted year-over-year impact from gross margin.\nBut that's part of the plan since the beginning. So we're not really worried about that as we head into 2025. Not going to give guidance obviously, but if you remember our long term algorithm, we do contemplate continuous gross margin expansion not to the level that we are seeing right now, but the 25 to 75 basis points-ish. But as a consequence of the very strong efficiency that they have, I think we were able to fix the supply chain now a few years ago, and we have now for four consecutive years in very strong delivery coming from the team. We feel very good about the pipeline that we have.\nWe have been able this year to not only remember, we had 3% inflation this year, we only pricing 1%, and we were able to offset that with efficiencies and still expand gross margin to invest in the business. So we do expect that this equation might continue to work into the future. So we should expect a more gradual but continuous gross margin expansion.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe only thing I would build on, Rob, is this idea of us really changing the rewiring of the company where we are all focused on driving efficiency because it's the fuel for us to drive profitable growth has now been embedded across the company. You see that with procurement, you see it in operations, but you also see it in marketing and us being able to have more efficiencies of how we go to market, improving the return on investment. You see that in trade, on how we apply AI to have better tools, on how we actually have more profitable, better investments, and profitable ways in which we can embed our trade as we go into the marketplace. So it is not a one and done. It is something that we believe can be a sustainable strength for us as a company.\nPersonally, I believe that having healthy gross margin is truly the key component of having a virtuous cycle of growth. And that is a big part of why we are so strong believers in a long-term outlook for the company.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe changes in operating model that you have done a couple of years ago to really reintegrate commercial and supply chain, I think, is really paying off big time. The incentive alignment that you have done, we mentioned it before, like everyone in the company has two KPIs in common with market share and gross margin. Because we want people to grow profitably. So I think that also contributes to that.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOkay, thank you everyone. Thank you for your interest in Kraft Heinz.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q1 2024 Kraft Heinz Co Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2024 Kraft Heinz Co Earnings Call\n\nKHCNASDAQMAY 1, 9:00 AM\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nEquity Analyst, Barclays\n\nRecently. But in the Accelerate platform specifically, your remarks call out holding or gaining share in about 55% of this platform. I guess, would you expect this percentage to be higher given the disproportionate, you know, allocation of resources to this platform? I guess a little more detail on share trends within Accelerate would be helpful. And then, you know, you mentioned US restaurants softening a bit. Are you starting to see any of that, you know, on the flip side, benefit at-home eating for your business? And if not, why would that be? Thanks so much.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So thank you, Andre, for the question. Before I get into the Accelerate, let me just at least give you a view of how I'm seeing so far the business performance. You know, if you look at the last five weeks, just to remove the noise of Easter, we actually have continued to see volume share improvement versus year to date, and we're holding dollar share at the same pace in the US. So that's at the macro level in the US for our company. Now, if you look at the Accelerate platforms, we actually continue to outperform the other platforms. So far, we are seeing flat in dollar share and growing volume share by 0.2 points. And now let me just break the other two, and then I'll go back to Accelerate.\nWe are losing share in Protect platforms, but we continue to see the impact of the decline in SNAP benefits. At the same time, I'm actually pretty excited about the renovations we are seeing in these brands because we are going to be continuing to bring more consumer preference options as we go into the rest of the year. In our Balance part of our portfolio, we are losing share but improving versus year-ago versus year-to-date, primarily driven by coffee. Now, to your question about Accelerate platforms, there's a couple of big brands that are in there that I would like to unpack a little more. If you think about our mac and cheese business, which is within the Accelerate platform, what you're going to be continuing to see is, one, we are going to start ramping a lot of the headwinds from SNAP.\nMac and Cheese was probably one of the more categories that were more actually impacted by SNAP. As we go into Q2, beginning now in May, you'll see a plethora of new innovations from gluten-free to new options on flavors on our Mac and Cheese business, as well as some new exciting things for the category with some new SKUs that we're bringing in the second half of the year. If you look at the other parts of our Accelerate platform, that includes our condiments. In the condiment side, what I would say is our category actually is expanding. We are growing, and we're actually growing volume share. For us, it's how do we continue to drive this growth within the category that has the right tailwinds behind it?\nAnd you'll see us continue to expand on the number of offers and innovations if we go into year 2.0. The one note that may be also helpful to understand in our Accelerate platform is also we also got out of some non-strategic business, in particular our Heinz Bulk Vinegar, which was a business that for us, in terms of the economics, didn't make much more sense. So we also exited that in Q1. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about Accelerate within the context of our company. I think the second part of your question is on an away-from-home business.\nI think, you know, let me just say that right now, as I mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant traffic in the US, which, you know, in some of it, is impacting our business, but also some of the impact that we saw in Q1 was due to us exiting some low-margin businesses, you know, as we think about making the right choice for the overall P&L. The actual exit of the business was about $50 million in Q1, and that's going to be similar throughout the rest of the year. Now, for us, as we believe, as we go forward, we actually believe that it's about us continuing to drive the importance of away from home in new channels.\nI mentioned in the opening remarks that we're also seeing great opportunities in terms of travel and leisure. That's an area where our teams are both focused because of the only growth, but also because it allows us to expand margins into those areas. We also are seeing improvement in terms of distribution of our core businesses as we go into Q3. So again, I feel very good about away from home. I think that the trends will continue to improve. At the same time, for us at Kraft Heinz, we have the scale to make sure that no matter where our consumers are shopping at hotels, whether they're going into restaurants or at home, that we have the distribution opportunity for us to kind of make sure that we are there to service anywhere they are.\nThanks for your question, Andre.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nEquity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. You mentioned inflation in your comments in a few areas. I guess two questions here. First, I don't think you updated us. Forgive me if I missed it, but I think last time you were talking about maybe 3% cost inflation for the year. I'm just curious if that's still a reasonable number. And then, you know, I guess second, more broadly, you know, there's been a lot of attention paid to cocoa, obviously, but coffee inflation has been fairly notable as well. And I'm just curious, right, even though historically coffee is somewhat of a pass-through category, do you think that if you and your competitors need, you'll be able and even willing to raise prices to customers as much as you typically might hear, or do you maybe expect a little more, I guess, pushback than usual?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Ken, for that question. Let me just start, and then I'll ask Andre to continue, to build on it. You know, for us, we are certainly committed to continue to provide families with affordable options. And that means something that we take very seriously. And if you think about 2023, we did end the year with 3% inflation, but we only passed about 1% price into consumers. So we do that very, very intentionally in a way for us to make sure we are all doing everything we can to offset things so that consumers don't see it. Now, Andre, if you want to comment a little more in terms of what you see in terms of cost inflation today and the coffee category.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. Good morning, Ken. So yeah, we still expect inflation to be in the low single-digit territory, like we said before. So nothing has changed in that regard. We have inflation a bit more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than in the shoulder quarters, and that's primarily because of what you call the big three commodities, cheese, meat, coffee, which we are seeing particularly in meat and cheese, higher level of inflation happening Q2, Q3 as you're lapping very favorable comps from last year. So yeah, we don't see any other meaningful change here. And the price that we've been taking is very surgical around those categories that have been suffering the largest impact. As I say, cocoa luckily is not a relevant part of our portfolio at all.\nI mean, a little bit in Netherlands, but beyond that, there's nothing of worth mentioning. And we don't see any reason to believe at this point that we will not be able to continue to pass through the prices in those commodity categories like it has always been the case, so.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Thank you. And if I could ask a quick follow-up, just the increase in gross margin guidance coupled with no other changes, you know, implies a bit higher SG&A than you previously expected. So just assuming that's accurate, are there any key areas in operating expenses we should think about that are maybe a little bit higher than planned? Obviously, not a huge amount. Or maybe the plant shutdowns, the primary, I guess, culprit here, so to speak, just trying to get a little color there if we could.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo as a CFO, we are starting to deploy our Brand Growth System, which is the method that allows us to continue to improve in our marketing and continue to strengthen our brands. One of the components of the Brand Growth System is to ensure that you have the sufficient level of marketing across the portfolio. We're starting to see a few selected areas where we need to step up market investment, thinking on the long term, and we have been gradually approving incremental investments on top of what initially planned on the marketing side in particular, which I think is a great thing for us. That's all.\nThank you, Ken.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nOne moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I just had two questions. One, just, I guess, a detail. Can you share with us, I think in the past, you've shared with us how much the SNAP, you know, issue has impacted organic sales? So do you have that for Q1?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLook, it's never 100% precise. We're talking about a macroeconomic model. But we estimate on the US retail business, like, in the range of 200 basis points in negative impact.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then I have a question on the away from home in the US and the deceleration. And again, you've quantified the impact of the plant closure. But just can you give us a sense of how much the impact of exiting the customer? But can you give us a sense of just how much of the decline is also related to, like, traffic at restaurants? You know, just trying to get a sense of the weighting of what's actually driving this slowdown. And then also, as you look into the second half, right, where you're expecting there's an expectation that there's going to be some recovery, just what underpins that?\nI say that in the context of, you know, as we're kind of going through earnings season, a lot of the restaurants have, you know, incrementally gotten worse or slower. So, you know, just, is there maybe too much optimism baked into the back half, expectation for recovery when it looks like a lot of these restaurant companies are going down?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me start on the end if you want to kind of build on that. Thanks for the question, Bryan. You know, first of all, I, you know, I continue to feel very good about our overall strategy globally about away from home. Again, it's a business that we are seeing continue to improve outside the US and even as we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant business here in the US. As I think about the second half, there are a few things that I think will feel better as we go into this rest of the year, even in the US here.\nYou know, first of all, then we mentioned about this factory impact that we had to close down one plant for maintenance, and that's going to affect us in Q2, and that will be behind us as we go into the second half of the year. The second part is that we are also going to be expanding the number of clients into which we're going to fit our portfolio. So there's a number of things that, you know, I cannot speak to today, but that we'll see as we go into Q3, in which we actually expand the distribution of our products. And then the third part is that we are going to continue to drive the focus on us going into attractive higher margin channels.\nSo again, beyond the restaurants in places like leisure, hospitality, and travel, where we are actually seeing better performance because of the higher-income consumer and us getting into those channels in particular. I think within that channel, we are seeing very successful programs around our Heinz Selection program and hospitality experiences that allow us to bring differentiated type of programs in an industry that until now, we really haven't played as strongly. Then lastly, what I would say is this is an area where we're going to continue to drive innovation in away-from-home.\nI mean, already, you are seeing how we are taking our Heinz Remix machine, and we are actually using that and planning it to work in the partnership that we have with BurgerFi, which is now our first restaurant to debut our Heinz Remix, and that we're going to see that expanding as we go into 2024. So the idea is it's not only the fact that we're going to be present, but we're also going to continue to be innovative in both the channel and the type of products we're going to bring into those channels. And Andre, anything else you would talk about?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI don't think so. Thanks for the question, Bryan.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Mizuho Securities\n\nCarlos, you highlighted consumer stress as a theme. And I wanted to ask, in North America, where the volume declines are still more pronounced, things like, you know, mac and cheese, which you just detailed for Andre, but also ketchup and juices, these are categories where private labels have underpenetrated historically, and now you're seeing volumes growing a bit. Are you seeing anything different, whether it's new merchandising by retailers or new price sensitivity among consumers, that's changing the dynamic in these categories at all? So I'm curious for your take on the pockets of private label share growth. And then maybe a follow-up, are there any specific categories in US retail where you're expecting material benefits from joint business plans or a reinvestment for the duration of this year?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI mean, thank you for the question. First on the private label, you know, first of all, you know, we are fortunate that we have such an iconic and beloved brand in our portfolio. I think what you're seeing is that really we haven't seen much of a change in terms of our overall gaps versus private label. I think for us, the benefit that we have had is that over the last two years, we have spent a significant amount of energy in continuing to renovate our portfolio. Today, we certainly have in the US renovated almost 100% of our portfolio to make sure that it continues to be relevant for today and tomorrow. I think that along with the fact that we are also very much focused on delivering great value to consumers.\nYou know, we have to make sure that as we think about value, that it's not just about the price point. It's also about it's worth paying for. So that's why our focus on driving quality products in a way that is affordable and giving more consumer choices, that is also driving the overall value equation for consumers. So what you're seeing in the data is, you know, private label have been gaining share, but really they have stabilized, and they're taking more share from other branded players.\nIn terms of our JVP, that continues to be a strength of ours that, frankly, you know, it comes out with the fact that we have been building this trust and partnership with our key retailers that allows us to truly leverage the scale of our total portfolio in a way that helps us to both drive our distribution of innovation as well as improve our overall performance and execution in store. Because of this partnership, we can do things in store that probably other peers cannot do. You know, whether that's you think about the holiday season coming up now in the summer, we have the range of our portfolio that allows us to create truly differentiating and unique value promotions that other people cannot do.\nSo it's something that we continue to elevate, and we continue to build on as we have strengthened our portfolio and the partnership we have with the key retailers. Thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. Hey, Carlos, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the unplanned maintenance that you had to take on one of your away-from-home plants. It seems that you've resolved that issue, and you expect the impacts to be isolated to Q2. But maybe just a little bit more details on sort of what transpired there, you know, any kind of root cause diagnostic. And then, you know, just do you expect that to be a pretty quick bounce back and recovery in Q3, or is the recovery going to be more spread across the back half? Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question, Steve. Yeah. Listen, you know, it's not. I wouldn't not give you that much more information that I already shared. It was a temporary shutdown in our plant for that unplanned maintenance. Now, that particular factory was very much focused on our away-from-home business. And so those condiments are places that we cannot source from other places as much within our network of factories. So that's why, in particular, it created a little bit of a dissonance in the Q2 only. And Andre, if you want to give a little more details on the impact in our what we see in the range of the portfolio for Q2.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So as we said in prepared remarks, production has resumed and is gradually going back towards the prior level. Not there yet, but production has resumed. And that's why I expect the impact to be. We do expect production to be fully back on track within the quarter. And then the impact on pipeline, as we said, will be in the range of 50 to 100 basis points to the total company growth, which is a function of how fast we can really bring the production fully up to speed.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for the question, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nTwo questions. Thanks. First, to follow up on food service, what is your general food service assumption going forward that underlies your mid-single-digit organic growth that you have planned for the year? Is that you basically expect that current trends industry-wide and globally will remain a similar level that you saw in the Q1 or improving from there? And then secondly, just Oscar Mayer, the beverage business, both were declining maybe mid-single digits or so in measured channels in the Q1. Could you maybe talk about the challenges and general plans and prospects for improvement for each of those? Thanks very much.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you. Maybe, Andre, if you can comment on away from home and maybe I can build on the Oscar Mayer and beverage business.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So first, if you think about our second half, as you said, we expect to be on algo throughout the entire second half. And if you think about our three pillars of growth, first, on emerging markets, as you said, Q1 came in line with what we said will happen, mid-single digit, primarily because of the shipment phase in Brazil. So as we head into Q2, we do expect emerging markets to be now very close or at our long-term algo, and in the second half fully on the long-term algo. So that's a point comes from that, roughly, maybe a little more. On the US retail business, as a function of industry improving gradually, volume continues to improve, all the innovation renovation. Carlos mentioned a few examples. We do expect to be, if not on algo, at least approaching algo.\nSo that will be a big contributor for the improvement as we head into the second half. And then finally, on away from home, like, we don't need to be fully on algo to deliver our numbers in the second half, and that's not what we're contemplating. So we don't expect away from home to be fully back on algo, even though on the international side, we should be back there. In the US, where we think the dynamics of the industry is what gives us a pause, we do expect improvement and a gradual improvement on industry plus the business wings. But I mean, I think we're still a bit on a pause to see how much of the industry will recover. But again, we don't need to be fully on algo in the US away from home to deliver our guidance for the second half.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYes. And then, you know, just going to dig deeper on the Oscar Mayer and beverage questions, David, I would say if you go back to our kind of your presentation, those are businesses that are in two different portfolio roles within our company. So our beverage business is within our Protect business, in which we actually are allocating resources in order to protect the profitability through the renovation across those brands to drive the growth. So if you think about some of our key brands there, you see that our MiO, in which we actually just renovated our entire kind of design or product. We have a new campaign, a marketing campaign focused on the wellness the brand can offer.\nIf you think about Crystal Light, we just debuted our first major innovation in 10 years, and we're launching a number of new and exciting functional benefits. If you think, and then for us, it's how do we continue to drive that sense of focus on renovating on those particular products because we know they are differentiated, and we think they are well-positioned for the long term. In the Oscar Mayer, it's part of our balanced business, which, again, we are making sure we're making the right investments in order to protect our distribution. And at the same time, we also are being thoughtful about how we are going to manage, you know, businesses that are very exposed to the commodity side of things.\nSo we are also being thoughtful of making sure we are protecting the top line, while at the same time making sure we have the right gross margins management in order for us to make it work within the entire Kraft Heinz portfolio.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. The only thing I'll add on the balanced portfolio as a whole, you saw in prepared remarks, that the overall, the balance declined 4% in the quarter. But the gross profit dollars grew 5%. So as you have said before, we continue to—it's a balancing act, and we continue to make sure that we don't starve those brands of the core investments to sustain their business. But we should not expect any average growth coming from there.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator? Yes. Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. André, I think you might have already answered this, but mathematically, I think the guidance now for food service implies a 50 basis points reduction to the overall company compared to, I think, the high single-digit guidance you had last quarter. So does the rest of the portfolio need to offset that? Are you expecting anything to be a little better than you expected, or is it just kind of absorbed? And then secondly, I think the slide said that you're, you know, you're seeing improvement in retail trends in US retail. Maybe that's just versus a year ago.\nBut can I assume that, you know, despite the market shares being, you know, down versus a year ago, that do you need to make any big adjustments to your marketing plan for 2024? Is there any increased price investment or advertising investment that needs to be made, that's different from what you expected? Thanks.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndre, you want to start with away from home, and I can comment on the retail trends?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So good morning, Rob. First, as you said, the 50 basis points that we mentioned in prepared remarks, just to be clear, is linked to the 50 to 100 basis points linked to the plant shutdown and is focused on the Q2. So we do not expect impact from that as we go into the second half. So as we've headed into the second half, as I said before, we do expect emerging markets to be fully back on algo. We do expect the US retail, North America retail to continue to improve, like improving Q1. We expect to improve more in Q2 and then more in the second half, like as a function, again, of lapping the SNAP and a lot of contribution from innovation and renovation.\nOn the away from home, we do expect the rest of the world to gradually improve and get close, if not at Algo. Then the US becomes the question where we don't need to be at mid-single digit in the second half for us to achieve our our guidance. But we do expect a gradual improvement in industry. And I think we have we have seen that from different sources as well. I think that there is a general expectation of that, together with all the business wins that we have done. And I think then we're we're we're going to be past the situation with the plant as we had in the second half.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, André. On the retail trends, you know, I guess I'll go back to the point in the beginning, which is we are seeing volume share improvements versus in the last five weeks with the year to date. So we are seeing that the momentum is happening already. For us, you know, what we are going to be doing is focus on those things we can control, which is as you go into the year to go, you'll see us continue to drive the renovation of our brands. Like I mentioned, whether it's in our Protect platforms and Accelerate, whether it's driving more innovation, as you'll see now, again, now in Q2, as we continue to step up through the rest of the year, and then be smart in our marketing investments.\nAndre mentioned earlier that part of the reason we're taking some of those gross margin dollars and investing back in the business is because now we are deploying a Brand Growth System that allows us to think about how do we make sure we've been smart about where to spend and places that maybe we haven't been spending at sufficient levels. So you are, in fact, going to see that continued focus on us driving the right dollars against the right priorities for us to drive the retail growth. And thank you for the question, Rob. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us. This concludes our earnings call for the Q1, 2024. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Carlos, over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nWell, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. You know, before opening the call for questions, I just would like to say thank you to all my colleagues here at Kraft Heinz for delivering another solid 2023 results and, at the same time, making the strategic investment for the future. Frankly, all that while navigating some persistent industry pressures. I am very enthusiastic for our next chapter here at Kraft Heinz, and in 2024, we expect to drive top-line growth, return to positive volumes, expand gross margins and operating margins, and continue to reinvest in the business and our iconic brands. With that, I have Andre joining me today. Let's open the call for the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. He may proceed.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nMorning.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nCarlos, I was hoping to start out. Maybe organic sales in the Q4 were impacted, as you talked about, by trade timing and a retail inventory deload. You're suggesting that you expect the Q1 organic sales to be similar to Q4, which implies that underlying sales maybe could be a bit worse than Q4, as I don't think you expect the retailer deload to continue. So if I have that right, I guess what would cause the sequential slowdown in organic sales in Q1, and how do you see that playing out moving forward?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYeah. Good question, Andrew. Thank you for that. You know, the math on Q4 to Q1 may be similar, but the factors driving it are very, very different. I think maybe, Andre, if you could give a little more color as to the effects of both the North America business versus the emerging market business and how that's shaping kind of the math behind the numbers.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. Good morning again, Andrew. So as Carlos said, we do expect similar numbers on Q4, but coming from different drivers. So on North America, we do expect better performance because we should not repeat both the trade timing and the inventory deload. We think we're going to be at a healthy level at this point. And sell out, if anything, maybe will be in line with slightly better heading to Q1. Now, when you talk about emerging markets, we do expect a shipment phasing that will affect Q1. So we do expect, instead of growing double digits like we have been doing consistently, emerging markets should be growing the mid-single-digit territory. You might remember that last year we had a very strong performance in Latin America. Brazil grew 40% in Q1.\nSo we're going to lap that, but nothing wrong with the underlying sell-out trends, both in North America and in emerging markets.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Really helpful. And then, Carlos, it seems like, if I have this right, most of the pressure in the GROW Platform in Q4 was in easy meals. If I have that right, can you talk a bit about what caused that and maybe how this plays out as you move into Q1? Because it sounds like you do expect North America to get better.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYeah. And frankly, Andrew, if I think about Q4, let me start with some of the positive, which is, you know, we also saw the return to growth of our IDA business driving both growth and share performance as we continue to leverage kind of the new partnership we have with our Simplot and really being able to serve the business to its full potential. Now, on the kind of headwind side, I think we saw some challenges in our mac and cheese business. Frankly, it's a business that is driven disproportionately by our SNAP exposure. So that affected some of the business in Q4. However, as I think about going forward, there are three key things we're doing to make sure we improve the trajectory.\nOne, we are also making sure we are investing further in our new campaign behind mac and cheese and driving new innovation behind it as well. So you'll see from us additional areas around bringing new SKU flavors. We're bringing variety packs, and we're bringing, you may have seen, a new plant-based option with mac and cheese in a partnership with NotCo. We're also making sure we continue to drive even better value with mac and cheese by leveraging the fact that we have in our portfolio partnerships that we can do with brands like Oscar Mayer to offer truly a complete meal solution for consumers, plus offering multi-packs around 12 packs and four packs in different formats to different types of consumers who are looking for value.\nAnd then finally, we're also making sure we're partnering with retailers, and we're actually improving the overall assortment to optimize the traffic down the aisle. So I feel very good about the fact that the team has been able to acknowledge what happened and taking up creating a new plan for us into 2024 to improve the performance of easy meals.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, and see you all next week.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nTake care. See you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI just had a question. I have a question about food service, and maybe if you can just drill in a little bit. In North America, it decelerated relative to the previous quarters, and I think even in your slide, you've got underperformed relative to the industry. And so I guess a couple of questions there. One is just, you know, was there a trade or an inventory deload happening in food service? Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the respective channels within food service, you know, what got better and maybe what got worse. And then, you know, sort of your expectations both for North America and global on food service, you know, do you expect it to be kind of in line with your algorithm for food service this year or maybe even a touch better?\nJust want to unpack that food service a little bit more, please.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGlad to. Let me start by clarifying something you said in your question. You know, in our food service business, we are growing both ahead of the industry in North America and internationally. So I think that we actually feel very good about our performance on food service, and we see that as we go forward into 2024. So, you know, we see food service growing up, growing in 2024, you know, appropriately with a long-term guidance, so high single digits. So we think actually it's going to be a continued driver of our performance as we go into 2024.\nFrankly, we see that us having even more confidence as we go forward because we are not only performing well where we are, but we also are improving by getting into new higher margin channels, like independent and non-commercial channels, plus driving big innovation, leveraging our technology, leveraging the iconic brands that we have. Until now, we have seen the beginning of the potential of food service, and that is actually driving faster growth than we have seen in the industry. We actually believe that between the innovation that we have, between us going into new channels that are higher margin and more attractive, we can actually make that even a faster growing part of our portfolio as we go forward.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI guess if I'm looking at slide nine correctly, I think you've got the industry growing faster than your North America business in Q4. So again, it just seems like I don't know if there's a disconnect between what you shipped versus what consumption was, but again, unless I'm looking at this slide incorrectly, it actually looks like you underperformed the industry.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nLet me just say, I think you are looking at this slide incorrectly. I'm happy to follow up with you specifically.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Steven Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nSteven Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Carlos, I guess stepping back, I'd just like a little bit more detail on your conviction surrounding improved total portfolio volume trends and presumably volume share trends and a return to growth as you progress through 2024. Because on the one hand, I understand drivers that you talk about in your prepared remarks. On the other hand, we're coming off a quarter that saw you tweak organic growth expectations lower coming into the quarter and then effectively undershoot those expectations, you know, when the dust settled. So I guess, again, what gives you the confidence that we're not only leveling off, but we're approaching a level where we can return to growth, you know, without, I guess, incremental investment in promotions and price? Because it doesn't seem like that's part of the outlook.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nRight. Let me just unpack that a little bit. You know, first, as Andre mentioned earlier, there are some factors specifically affecting our Q4 performance in terms of trade as well as inventory that we're not going to repeat as we go forward. As we go into 2024, if I think about first the top line, you know, we are going to continue the progression of emerging market and food service. And then, you know, emerging markets are already growing volume. We are seeing the progress of our food service business growing faster than industry. And in North America, on the top line, we actually expect to recover share as we are now making all the payoff of the innovation investments we have made. We'll start seeing that coming throughout the year.\nSo I think that idea of us continuing to invest in the right things behind our insights in North America is paying off with innovation. And then it allows us to have the right business plans with our retailers. Those factors actually are going to help us drive the top line with confidence. If I think about kind of the pieces of specifically you talked about volume, you know, one of the things that we are looking at is we are anticipating a return to the historical activity levels. And in fact, we are seeing that already. So we are expecting volumes to turn positive in the second half of the year because, as I mentioned, the idea of us continuing to invest in innovation, that actually will give us the right tailwinds as we go into the year.\nPlus, we no longer will have some headwinds associated with both pricing that we took in Q1 of last year as well as the SNAP benefits cycling, that as we go into the second half of the year. So that also, you know, that all together gives me the confidence that we can see that us coming together with a better performance as we go into 2024 in a way that actually allows us to exit the year in an algo for us as a company.\n\nSteven Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Okay. Very good. Very good. Thank you. And then, Andre, if I could, you know, there was, you know, the Free Cash Flow conversion this year improved as it was expected to. So that's a positive, I guess. Just as we look into 2024, how are you thinking about Free Cash Flow conversion in the new year? Can we expect further improvements? And if not, you know, either way, I guess, what are the drivers of Free Cash Flow progress as we go forward? Thanks.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. Good morning. So yeah, as you pointed out, we were able to deliver a very solid cash flow conversion in 2023, above 80%. We do expect a small progression also as we head into 2024. We're still going to be in the 80s territory because we do expect another year of solid CapEx investment like we have been doing in the last two years. There's a lot of good investment opportunities for us in the organic business. Yeah. We have some tax step-up that we also mentioned that's affecting earnings as well. So those two factors go against that. But on the other hand, working capital should expect to continue to improve as a consequence of the investments we have been making.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYou know, the one thing I would add too is, as we go into those of you joining us in CAGNY, you know, we'll be able to unpack too a little more of our investments we're making. I mentioned quite a bit about innovation, about how we are going to continue to invest in our brands, making sure there's a peer to our competition. So I think you'll see a lot of more details from myself and the team when we're together in Florida.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Very good. We'll see you there. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Just curious, you know, there's some early indications that maybe as an industry, you know, quick service restaurants seeing some fraying at the edges in terms of consumer demand, mainly under the weight of, you know, higher prices. I'm just curious if this is something you're seeing as well, and to what extent, if at all, does your outlook, you know, maybe potentially factor some kind of slowdown there?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYeah. In our business, frankly, a lot of our business is really focused on front of the house. We are actually seeing solid performance for our away-from-home business, both in the US and as well as outside the US. If you think about the fact that outside the US, we use that channel very much as a way for us to drive awareness and build our brands, that continues to drive positive growth for us. In the US as well, we see that, you know, even within the context of QSR, we continue to see progress and improvements. But at the same time, we're also expanding into new channels that allow us to continue to drive the growth, whether that is from, you know, our vending opportunities into new hospitality areas.\nSo, we also are having a little bit of a broader view of how we define our away-from-home business to go into new spaces that we know are margin accretive, and not be dependent on just one channel in order for us to drive the growth.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thank you for that. And then the gross margin increase you're expecting this year, despite a little bit of lingering inflation, can you just remind us what some of the key drivers will be of that? Is it simply a continuation of what helped 2023 in terms of COGS efficiencies and some revenue growth management assistance?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. So we expect gross margin to expand again, and it's part of our long-term algorithm. We feel proud of what we have done so far. Reminding that we always have been pricing to offset inflation dollar for dollar, and that's what we have done in the last two years. However, in 2024, we are expecting to price approximately at 1% level, which is below the inflation that we expected at 3%. But so the main driver is really coming from the gross efficiencies. We have been delivering ahead of what we outlined to you a couple of years back. So 2023 is a very solid year, almost 4% of gross efficiency as a percentage of COGS. And in 2024, I do expect another solid year.\nSo these gross efficiencies are helping us not only to offset a component of the inflation, but also it's helping us to expand gross margins and investing a little more in the business on the SG&A side. And that's something that we should expect to see from us.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Analyst, Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning, Pamela.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Analyst, Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nI was hoping that you could double-click a bit into the drivers behind your Q4 results in North America and how you're thinking about those factors going forward. You pointed to weaker consumer demand, but also discrete headwinds like the inventory deload and lapping the trade accrual. So how are you thinking about North America consumer demand in 2024? And can you explain what drove the one-time dynamics? Was it a specific retailer or specific categories where you saw a deload? And maybe you can explain the effect of the trade accrual. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nLet me start, I guess, give you a sense for how we see the consumer today. Then maybe, Andrew, you can go deeper into the specifics about the Q4 and how we see that playing as we go forward. But, you know, I guess the place I would start would be that what we're seeing in the data is that regardless of the income levels, that consumer is looking for value, and they continue to be under pressure. What we see is low-income consumers are actually shopping more at places like dollar stores, higher-income consumers more at club stores. But mostly, you know, we are seeing them looking for overall smaller trips to stretch their dollar further.\nSo for us, it continues to be about how do we continue to deliver value in different ways to that consumer who are very much focused on value through essentially investing in our brands, making sure we have longer value offerings, and increasing the distribution in different channels beyond what we have done in the past. Let me just be specific before Andrew gives you the details on the Q4. You know, and if I think about club channels, you know, we have introduced a number of brands into club from Capri Sun to Lunchables to Classico Pasta Sauce. In fact, we also tested new innovation in our club channels. And in 2024, we'll have a 20% higher number of offerings in club than we did in 2023.\nNow, if I think about the entry points in the category and the SKU that we can have in kind of areas around dollar stores, we're actually making sure that we're driving things like improving our assortment of barbecue and mustard, or mayo and salad dressing, as well as new items around Taco Bell partnership that we have in order for us to drive expanded use of our Mexican initiatives. So if I think about dollar store, we actually have today over 300 SKUs. And year-over-year, we're going to be increasing about another 10% versus what we had in the past.\nSo we are making sure that we are in the right channels with the right assortment and continue to invest in our innovation in order to make sure that we are capturing consumers looking for value independent of where they're looking for different locations, different formats, different shopping behaviors. And now, Andre, if you want to give a little more context on the Q4.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. So North America, and that's still declined 3%. And approximately 140 bps is linked to the trade accrual release from last year from 2022 and from inventory de-load year-over-year. But in fact, it's not that we saw a de-load happening in 2023. It's that in Q4 2022, as we started to recover services, start to ship ahead of consumption. So we are lapping that effect. So there's nothing really on that regard affecting 2023. It's just a lapping effect.\nNow, the sellout: what's negative. It was hotter than what we anticipated. We underestimated the impact of SNAP in Q4. It turned out to be more than 150 basis points stronger than we thought. If you remember, there was a concentration of emergency allotments at the end of 2022. So on a year-over-year basis, the SNAP benefits declined close to 40%, which is substantial. That's what affected a lot of sellout. We should continue to see some of that in Q1. So on a year-over-year basis, Q1 2024 is still about 20% less in SNAP than last year. We're still going to suffer a portion of this effect. But on the other hand, our market share has improved in Q4 as we anticipated, which is a very good sign. We're exiting the year with the best share performance of 2023.\nSo that gives us a lot of good momentum heading into this year. Hope that helps.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Analyst, Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes. Thanks. Just a quick clarification. So are you saying that SNAP was a greater headwind in the Q4 than the prior two quarters? And why do you think that is?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYes, absolutely. Yes, because there is a concentration of Emergency Allotments considered in Q4 of 2022. So the SNAP benefits in Q4 2022 were actually higher than Q2 and Q3 2022.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Analyst, Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThis in itself is not a surprise. I mean, we just underestimated the elasticity of that.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Analyst, Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nFood, Beverage, Household Products and Personal Care Equities Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks. A couple of questions. Those of us analyzing your commodity exposure see a lot of deflation running through on the ingredient side, maybe even the packaging side. And your guidance is for inflation to be positive. Can you walk through some of the components that we can't see? Maybe it's conversion costs or things like that that make this continue to be an inflationary year. And then my second question was, you know, you have a $25 million write-down for, I think, systems related to your modernization efforts. Can you go into a little more detail as to what caused that write-down? Thanks.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. Good morning, Rob. Good to hear from you. So on the inflation side, as we said in primary markets, we do expect inflation again into 2024, low single digits, 3% territory. Even though ingredients as a whole, we see quite a few commodities that are deflationary, we still have the impact of maybe tomatoes and sugar affecting us negatively. So there is a little net increase in terms of commodity inflation. And then, but the biggest bulk of the inflation is really coming from labor. We continue to see relatively higher than pre-pandemic levels on wage increases, as well as transportation. In 2023, the transportation costs were quite low, and we are seeing some signs of rebound on the transportation cost side. So this is where inflation is mostly coming from.\nOn the second part of the question about the $25 million, so not 100% of that is the system write-off, even though it's the majority of it. This has to do with us deciding not to maintain investment in a certain technology that we think will not be relevant for the future. We decided to stop that investment and redirect the issue so that we think would be more relevant to us for future agenda. As you know, technology is front and center of our strategy. We have continued to make decisions to make sure that we can turn this into a competitive advantage to us.\nSo, if this might require us to make decisions in between a quarter that we not initially anticipated, because we saw that's the right thing for the business for the long term, we're not going to hesitate to do that.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nFood, Beverage, Household Products and Personal Care Equities Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you, Andre.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our last question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nMorning.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho Securities\n\nFirst off, morning. Wondering if you could provide an update on the outlook for efficiencies. Just given the overdelivery in 2023, what's included in the guide for 2024? And as you think out to this next round of improvements, specifically the new overhead savings from automation, fixed assets, how are you thinking about the timing for when those benefits begin to accrue?\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nOkay. So thanks for the question. As we said, 2023 was a very solid year with delivering close to 4% of efficiencies as percentage of COGS. We do expect 2024 to be another year where we will be delivering ahead of the 3% COGS that we have outlined. I want to make sure that you understand that not only this is a consequence of the complete ways of working change that we have done in supply chain, more focus on variable costs, and continuous improvements, but also we still have some efficiency opportunities that are coming through as a consequence of the pandemic and all the inefficiency generated by that. That helped in 2023, and that is still going to help a little bit in 2024. But beyond that, there are a lot of things happening on the supply chain space.\nDifficult to name only one because of the sheer size of our COGS. But we do have initiatives coming from network optimization in the US. We have a very complex distribution center network, more than 80 distribution centers overall. We do have initiatives in automation. In fact, we have a very strong partnership with Microsoft trying to do some technology to allow us to make faster decisions and with that improve labor usage, and reduce yield losses. We have a lot of opportunities on value engineering to continue to make sure that you offer the right type of attributes to consumers. So there is a lot of different levers. We're going to touch on a few of them next week in CAGNY. But I think we are very pleased with the quality of the pipeline we have in supply chain now.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nAnd I think you will see is that how the investments we have been making in technology, the partnership we have been making in digital, are basically fueling a lot of that efficiency in a way that actually creates some benefits for us for now and to the future as well. And again, we'll unpack that even further when we are together in Florida.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho Securities\n\nThanks for that. And then just quickly on international, the emerging markets volumes was pretty solid in Q4. But I'm wondering if you can speak to the volumes in the developed markets, what you're seeing in Europe from category performance, private label competition, and the consumer dynamics there, you know, sort of giving you confidence in the international guidance for 2024. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nHappy to. You know, I think if we think about what we have mentioned in terms of value and how consumers are looking for value in the US is similar as well too in terms of consumers in Europe. I mean, they are looking for that value as well. And we are continuing to make sure that we're bringing that value through the critical brands that we have, like, you know, our Heinz business in the UK, for example. And how do we continue to bring, you know, the products to the market that bring a number of improvements on our quality of our products, as well as focusing on the benefits that we bring.\nSo for example, a product like, you know, Heinz Beanz and the fact that it brings kind of such a benefit around protein, that's something that is kind of now shifting in terms of how we think about that product. The fact that we're also bringing within certain part of our categories new entries by leverage to our brands. So in baked beans, we'll have not only the Heinz Beanz, but we'll also have HP Baked Beans. And that allows us to actually play in a couple of different areas with consumers, both at the more mainstream as well as the more value.\nIn places like Germany, we're also introducing new benefits to consumers as they are looking also again for value, whether that is Heinz Mayonnaise in new channels in the discount spaces, but also making sure that we continue to bring the innovation consumers are looking for from us, like our Heinz Tomato Ketchup with zero sugar. We are approaching it with the same sense as we do in the US, which is let's make sure we're in the right channels with the right assortment. And at the same time, let's focus on bringing focus on the benefits that we bring with our products.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho Securities\n\nThanks, Carlos. Thanks, Andrew.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Anne-Marie Megela for any closing remarks.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you. Thank you, everyone, for your interest. We look forward to seeing you next week.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day, and thank you for standing by.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, and hello everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to a Q&A session for our Q4 2023 Business Update. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts, and investments, and related timing and expected impacts.

Carlos, over to you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nWell, thank you, Anne Marie, and thank you everyone for joining us today. You know, before opening the call for questions, I just would like to say thank you to all my colleagues here at Kraft Heinz for delivering another solid 2023 results and, at the same time, making the strategic investment for the future. And frankly, all that while navigating some persistent industry pressures. I am very enthusiastic for our next chapter here at Kraft Heinz, and in 2024, we expect to drive top-line growth, return to positive volumes, expand gross margins and operating margins, and continue to reinvest in the business and our iconic brands.\nWith that, I have Andre joining me today. Let's open the call for the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. He may proceed.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGood morning.\nCarlos, I was hoping to start out maybe organic sales in the Q4 were impacted, as you talked about, by trade timing and a retail inventory deload. You're suggesting that you expect the Q1 organic sales to be similar to Q4, which implies that underlying sales maybe could be a bit worse than Q4. I don't think you expect the retailer deload to continue. So if I have that right, I guess what would cause the sequential slowdown in organic sales in Q1, and how do you see that playing out moving forward?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYeah, good question, Andrew. Thank you for that. You know, the math on Q4 to Q1 may be similar, but the factors driving it are very, very different. I think maybe, Andre, if you could give a little more color as to the effects of both in North America business versus the emerging market business and how that's shaping kind of the math behind the numbers.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. Good morning again, Andrew. So as Carlos said, we do expect similar numbers on Q4, but coming from different drivers. So on North America, we do expect better performance because we should not repeat both the trade timing and the inventory deload.\nWe think we're going to be at a healthy level at this point. Sell-out, if anything, maybe will be in line with slightly better going into Q1. Now, when you talk about emerging markets, we do expect a shipment phasing that will affect Q1. We do expect, instead of growing double digits like we have been doing consistently, emerging markets should be growing the mid-single-digit territory. You might remember that last year we had a very strong performance in Latin America. Brazil grew 40% in Q1. We're going to lap that, but nothing wrong with the underlying sell-out trends, both in North America and in emerging markets.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Really helpful. Then, Carlos, it seems like, if I have this right, most of the pressure in the GROW Platform in the Q4 was in easy meals. If I have that right, can you talk a bit about what caused that and maybe how this plays out as you move into the Q1? Because it sounds like you do expect North America to get better.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nYeah. And frankly, Andrew, if I think about Q4, let me start with some of the positive, which is, you know, we also saw the return to growth of our Ore-Ida business driving both growth and share performance as we continue to leverage kind of the new partnership we have with our Simplot and really being able to serve the business to its full potential. Now, on the kind of headwind side, I think we saw some challenges in our mac and cheese business. Frankly, it's a business that is driven disproportionately by our SNAP exposure. So that affected some of the business in Q4.\nHowever, as I think about going forward, there are three key things we're doing to make sure we improve the trajectory. One, we also are investing further in our new campaign behind mac and cheese and driving new innovation behind it as well. So you'll see from us additional areas around bringing new SKU flavors. We're bringing variety packs, and we're bringing, you may have seen, a new plant-based option with mac and cheese in a partnership with NotCo. We're also making sure we continue to drive even better value with mac and cheese by leveraging the fact that we have in our portfolio partnerships that we can do with brands like Oscar Mayer to offer truly a complete meal solution for consumers, plus offering multi-packs around 12 packs and four packs in different formats to different types of consumers who are looking for value.\nAnd then finally, we're also making sure we're partnering with retailers and we're actually improving the overall assortment to optimize the traffic down the aisle. So I feel very good about the fact that the team has been able to acknowledge what happened and taking up creating a new plan for us into Q2 to improve the performance of easy meals.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, and see you all next week.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nTake care. See you again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI just had a question. I have a question about food service, and maybe if you can just drill in a little bit.\nIn North America, it decelerated relative to the previous quarters, and I think even in your slide, you've got underperformed relative to the industry. So I guess a couple of questions there. One is just, was there a trade or an inventory deload happening in food service? Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the respective channels within food service, what got better, and maybe what got worse. Then sort of your expectations, both for North America and global on food service. Do you expect it to be kind of in line with your algorithm for food service this year or maybe even a touch better? Just want to unpack that food service a little bit more, please.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nGlad to. Let me start by clarifying something you said in your question. In our food service business, we are growing both ahead of the industry in North America and internationally. So I think that we actually feel very good about our performance on food service, and we see that as we go forward into 2024. So we see food service growing up, growing in 2024, in line with a long-term guidance, so high single digits. So we think actually it's going to be a continued driver of our performance as we go into 2024. And frankly, we see us having even more confidence as we go forward because we are not only performing well where we are, but we also are improving by getting into new higher-margin channels, like independent and non-commercial channels, plus driving big innovation, leveraging our technology, leveraging the iconic brands that we have.\nSo until now, we have seen the beginning of the potential of food service, and that is actually driving faster growth than we have seen in the industry. And we actually believe that between the innovation that we have, between us going into new channels that are higher margin and more attractive, we can actually make that even a faster growing part of our portfolio as we go forward.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI guess if I'm looking at slide nine correctly, I think you've got the industry growing faster than your North America business in the Q4. So again, it just seems like I don't know if there's a disconnect between what you shipped versus what consumption was, but again, unless I'm looking at this slide incorrectly, it actually looks like you underperformed the industry.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nLet me just say, I think you are looking at this slide incorrectly, and happy to follow up with you specifically.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Steven Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nSteven Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Carlos, I guess stepping back, I just like a little bit more detail on your conviction surrounding improved total portfolio volume trends and presumably volume share trends, and a return to growth as you progress through Q4. Because on the one hand, I understand drivers that you talk about in your prepared remarks. On the other hand, we're coming off a quarter that saw you tweak organic growth expectations lower coming into the quarter and then effectively undershoot those expectations when the dust settled.\nSo I guess, again, what gives you the confidence that we're not only leveling off, but we're approaching a level where we can return to growth without, I guess, incremental investment in promotions and price? Because it doesn't seem like that's part of the outlook.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nRight. Let me unpack that a little bit. First, as Andre mentioned earlier, there are some factors specifically affecting our Q4 performance in terms of trade as well as inventory that we're not going to repeat as we go forward. As we go into 2024, if I think about first the top line, we are going to continue the progression of emerging market and food service. And then emerging markets are already growing volume. We are seeing the progress of our food service business growing faster in the industry.\nIn North America, on the top line, we actually expect to recover share as we are now making all the payoff of the innovation investment we have made. We'll start seeing that coming throughout the year. So I think that idea of us continuing to invest in the right things behind our insights in North America is paying off with innovation. And then it allows us too to have the right business plans with our retailers. Those factors actually are going to help us drive the top line with confidence. If I think about kind of the pieces of the specifically you talked about volume, one of the things that we are looking at is we are anticipating a return to the historical activity levels. And in fact, we are seeing that already.\nSo we are expecting volumes to turn positive in the second half of the year because, as I mentioned, the idea of us continuing to invest in innovation, that actually will give us the right tailwinds as we go into the year. Plus, we no longer will have some headwinds associated with both pricing that we took in Q1 of last year as well as the SNAP benefits cycling, that as we go into the second half of the year. So that all together gives me the confidence that we can see that us coming together with a better performance as we go into Q2 in a way that actually allows us to exit the year in an Algo for us as a company.\n\nSteven Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Okay. Very good. Very good. Thank you. And then, Andre, if I could, there was the free cash flow conversion this year improved as it was expected to. So that's a positive, I guess. Just as we look into Q2, how are you thinking about free cash flow conversion in the new year? Can we expect further improvements? And if not, either way, I guess, what are the drivers of free cash flow progress as we go forward? Thanks.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nSure. Good morning. So yeah, as you pointed out, we were able to deliver a very solid cash flow conversion in 2023, above 80%. And we do expect a small progression also as we head into 2024. We're still going to be in the 80s territory because we do expect another year of solid CapEx investment like we have been doing in the last two years.\nThere's a lot of good investment opportunities for us in the organic business. Yeah. And we have some tax step-up that we also mentioned that's affecting earnings as well. So those two factors go against that. But on the other hand, working capital should expect to continue to improve as a consequence of the investments we have been making.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThe one thing I would add too is, as we go into CAGNY, those of you joining us in CAGNY, and we'll be able to unpack too a little more of our investments we're making. I mentioned quite a bit about innovation, about how we are going to continue to invest in our brands, making sure they're superior to our competition. So I think you'll see a lot more details from myself and the team when we're together in Florida.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nAmericas Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Very good. We'll see you there. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Just curious, there's some early indications that maybe as an industry, quick service restaurants are seeing some fraying at the edges in terms of consumer.",

I'd like to welcome you to our Third Quarter 2023 Business Update. During the following remarks, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy efforts and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release which accompanies these remarks, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we will refer to Non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release, and the Non-GAAP information available on our website @ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our Non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nToday, our Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair Miguel Patricio and President of Kraft Heinz, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, will provide an update on our overall business performance, and Andre Maciel, our Global Chief Financial Officer, will provide a financial review of the third quarter and will discuss our 2023 outlook. We have also scheduled a separate live question and answer session with analysts. You can access our earnings release, supplemental materials, and audio of our question and answer session @ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. A replay of the question and answer session will be available following the event through the same website. With that, I will turn it over to Miguel.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO and Board Chair, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie, and thanks you all. For joining us today. I'm so proud of what the team have accomplished in the third quarter, we again generated accelerated profitable growth. All three of our growth pillars, Foodservice, Emerging Markets, and our US Retail growth platforms contributed to the top line growth. At the same time, we improved our productivity across our value chain. Our share and volume trends continue to improve versus the second quarter of 2023 as we execute our action plans and reinvest and lock the efficiencies back into the business across marketing, R&D, and technology.\nImportantly, our Taste Elevation and Easy Meals platforms in the US are not just seeing an improvement in market share, we are now taking share, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, hitting our target net leverage of approximately three times, while at the same time increasing investments to support the long-term growth of the business. Of course we still have much to do and some headwinds to face, but our strategy is working. Our balance sheet is solid and we believe we are positioned to return more value to our stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Carlos, our newly appointed President of Kraft Heinz, to run through our quarterly results in more detail.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nPresident, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Miguel, in the third quarter. We grew top line and improved profitability. Organic net sales increased 1.7% with constant currency, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growing at a much faster pace, 12.9% and 14.3%, respectively. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by gross profit margin expansion, which was a result of unlocking efficiencies across our value chain and pricing to inflation. In line with our strategy, we're reinvesting unlocked efficiencies back into the business to grow organically. We are increasing year to date investments in SG&A across marketing, R&D, and technology, and CapEx by approximately $385 million versus last year.\nAs Miguel mentioned, we are continuing to fuel organic net sales through growth across all three pillars. In the third quarter, Foodservice sales grew approximately 9%. Emerging Markets organic net sales grew 10% and our growth platforms in the US Retail organic net sales grew 3%. Our Foodservice business gained market share as our consolidated 9% sales growth outpaced the industry both in North America and International.\nFor the full year, we expect Foodservice to grow low to mid double digits versus the prior year. As you may recall, our Foodservice growth strategy consists of three levers. First, we drive sales through our Chef-Led Model, leveraging our dedicated chef network. To create tailored menu solutions for our customers. Second, we are prioritizing higher-margin spaces by expanding across attractive channels like non-commercial with higher growth and higher margin. Lastly, using Foodservice as a flywheel. For innovation allows us to better customize solutions for our customers and launch insight-driven innovation.\nNow let's turn to Emerging Markets. We continue to deliver double digit organic net sales growth in Emerging Markets. In third quarter, organic net sales grew 10% outpacing our international. We generated high double-digit organic net sales growth in two out of three of our business units, LATAM and East. However, we experienced temporary softness in Asia. We expect to return to normal level of growth in Asia in fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to deliver double-digit growth in Emerging Markets. We plan to continue to drive growth in Emerging Markets through our differentiated strategy consisting of three levers.\nFirst is data-driven repeatable go-to market model to drive distribution, designed to capture opportunities with the right products in the right market. By the end of 2023 we expect to have approximately 90% of our Emerging Markets go to market model design and ready for implementation. Second, it's through the power of our Heinz brand which extends well beyond ketchup. Local jewels complement Heinz across several of our international market, and third, our Foodservice business, which we are underpenetrated with less than 5% share in global market of approximately $1.4 billion.\nFinally, let's look at the US Retail growth platforms in our North America zone. In the third quarter, our North America organic net sales declined 0.1% versus prior year while our growth platforms in the US grew 3.3%. Total North America results were primarily impacted by declining volumes in our meat business. As a reminder, the meat category is a part of our Energize platform and we are focused on rebuilding profitability, acting rationally, and protecting our adjusted EBITDA dollars. This approach continues to work as we generated higher adjusted EBITDA on lower guiding net sales in meat in the third quarter.\nIn the third quarter the meat category. Had a -1.2 percentage point impact on total North America organic net sales growth. Within US Retail growth platforms, Taste Elevation organic net sales grew an impressive 7%, and Easy Meals organic net sales grew 5% in Q3. Ketchup, mayonnaise, and Mexican sauces in Taste Elevation and frozen potatoes in Easy Meals led the year-over-year growth. Now turning to market share as Miguel had previously mentioned, our action plans are working. They are driving sequential improvement in both share and volume trends. As a reminder, these plans consist of executing joint business plans with key customers to drive shelf space and quality merchandising, with a 1.5 percentage point year to date improvement in US share shelf index.\nVersus prior year, increasing marketing investment 25% versus prior year, with a focus on growth platforms, ramping up innovation throughout the year supported by an increase of 8% versus prior year in R&D spend and solving remaining isolated supply constraints. This is behind us in most categories with a case fill rate in the high 90s at the end of Q3. As you can see, these investments are paying off looking at our US dollar share, we have recovered from the low levels experienced earlier this year.\nAs you recall, we face expected headwinds after pricing 75% of our portfolio and the reduction of SNAP benefits earlier this year. We have planned for electricity to return to more normal levels, and that's what we have seen. In July at a point when volume losses in cold cuts were at the highest, we hit the lowest share levels of the year. Since then we have improved volume as year-over-year price gaps have narrowed in Taste Elevation and Easy Meals, which are represented by the light blue line. We have steadily improved and are now gaining market share from branded players.\nIf you recall from last quarter, our share loss was concentrated in three cream cheese, cold cuts, and kids' single-serve beverage. Across cream cheese and cold cuts, we have seen recovery in share, particularly in the month of September. In cream cheese upstream packaging constraints in the first half of last year impacted our ability to promote in key windows, and as a result we lost display and considerable share to private label. We started recovering share in July as we work with key retailers to rebuild display. Now, October month-to-date, we are growing approximately 50 basis points of share versus prior year in cream cheese.\nIn cold cuts, we are investing to hit the right price points, which is helping to drive an improvement in our share performance. Additionally, we plan to continue to focus on improving service in our value portfolio, where case fill rates are still in the low 80s. We are expecting improvement by the end of the year. In kids single-serve beverage, our share continues to be pressured, primarily driven by the reduction in the SNAP benefits as well as lapping competitive out of stock in the prior year. We have improvement plans in place which include increasing advertising support as well as new consumer promotions and displays activations.\nAs previously mentioned, to support our action plans and to continue building for the future, we are investing in SG&A across marketing, R&D, and technology. In the third quarter, we increased our spending marketing by 25%, R&D by 8%, and technology by approximately 24% versus the third quarter in 2022. In the third quarter, we increased marketing spend by 25% year-over-year, by leveraging the power of iconic brands like Heinz, we continue to generate best in class marketing activations. We are embracing a holistic and sustainable approach to marketing, inserting ourselves into culture. For example, our global Heinz creative approach is multidimensional. It's currently live in more than 16 countries including the UK, Egypt, and China, with a multi-category approach across more than just ketchup and also in categories such as beans, soups, and mayonnaise.\nIt's working. At the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Heinz was the most awarded food brand and the fourth most awarded brand overall. At the same time, we are moving. At the speed of culture. After the Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch sauce combination went viral, in under 24 hours, our teams jumped on that trend. Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch became an overnight sensation sweeping the news online, even spreading international. With consumers clamoring to get their hands on the product. We were even able to get from idea to shelf as a limited release with a national customer in less than three weeks.\nThis launch demonstrates our powerful agility and how our teams are using Agile@Scale to move at the speed of culture. Turning to R&D, we continue to build our innovation pipeline enabled by our Agile Innovation Engine. First, we are utilizing intellectual patent protected technology to create disruptive platforms with our new grilled cheeses, the first product of many expected to come out of our exclusive 360CRISP platform. Second, we are expanding into new aisles across multiple locations and host foods, through innovation launches such as Frozen Kraft Mac and Cheese and our Heinz Culinary Tomatoes line in the UK.\nThird, we are leveraging our iconic brands. To meet evolving consumer trends such as wellness, snacking, and plant-based to compete in priority growth spaces. Lastly, we are adapting to local taste and creating unique flavor combinations across the world, particularly international where our goal is to become the number one in Taste Elevation. In fact, this year we are honored to announce that both Heinz Remix and 360CRISP were named to TIME's Best Inventions of 2023 list. For over two decades, TIME has developed an annual list dedicated to the year's top inventions which are evaluated based on criteria including originality, ambition, and impact.\nKraft Heinz is the only large food company to make the 2023 list, and we are the only company to have more than one invention feature in the food and drink category. Finally, through Agile@Scale and strategic partnerships, we are delivering solutions across our value chain to accelerate growth and help drive efficiencies. As part of Agile@Scale, our teams are building digital-first solutions to power Kraft Heinz to get to better insights faster. These digital solutions are helping to contribute to our annual growth efficiency target, which has accelerated to $500 million for 2023.\nOur investments in capabilities and technology are helping us drive transformation across several areas of the business. Importantly, we're not the only ones benefiting from these improvements our customers and suppliers are as well. Our US Kantar scores are improving each year and we have been recognized with our first-ever World Procurement Award for Supplier Collaboration and Innovation. Not only are we stepping up our investments in 2023 to unlock new growth and efficiency opportunities throughout our business, but we are also investing for the future, through our ESG goals, and our responsibility to consumers, our employees, and the planet.\nWe released our 2023 ESG report together at the Table on 16 October. It reflects key progress across each of our three ESG pillars: healthy living and community support, environmental stewardship, and responsible sourcing. Now I would like to give credit to our employees as they are the key to our success. I'm incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment to making Kraft Heinz a place, we all want to be and a place others want to join. Each year we are being certified as a Great Place to Work in more and more countries, including being named as one of the 100 most loved workplaces in America in 2023 by Newsweek.\nThese are a testament to how far we have become a benchmark for all who dare to do better. Before I hand it off to Andre, I would like to start by saying that I'm so proud of what we have been able to achieve across the business and as we have executed our strategy, delivering results in 2023 and building momentum for 2024. I also would like to highlight that this morning we announced three changes to our leadership and organizational structure to best support accelerated profitable growth and to lead the future of food.\nFirst, we name our new EVP and President of North America, Pedro Navio. Pedro is a consumer goods veteran and currently, our President of Taste Meals and Away From Home for the North America Zone. Second, we have elevated our growth and omnichannel functions to a global level, providing the structure and support to leverage centralized expertise and resources. The goal of this structure and these investments is to drive growth and disruptive innovation across the business where we provide optimal service to our customers and put our consumers first. Third, we have divided our international zone into three zones.\nThey are Europe and Pacific Developed Markets, which include Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea, West and East Emerging Markets, which include Latin, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, and Asian Emerging Markets. which include the rest of our Asian business outside of Japan and South Korea. We recognize these markets require different sets of strategies and skills and this new structure provides the necessary focus and resources. To optimize our growth potential. I am proud to say that every single one of these leadership appointments supporting these changes have been sourced internally.\nThis speaks to the exceptional quality of the talent at Kraft Heinz and the focus and value we place on people development and growth. Let me now hand it over to Andre to provide more details on our third quarter financial results and to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nGlobal CFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Carlos, for total Kraft Heinz, organic net sales grew 1.7% in the quarter, fueled by our three pillars of growth. Price grew 7.1 percentage points over the same period, partially offset by a 5.4. Percentage point decline in volume mix. Our volume trends have improved on a sequential basis as the impact of pricing, wins and our action plans have started to take shape. We expect volume trends to continue to improve.\nIn North America, organic net sales declined 0.1%. This was driven primarily by our meats business, which had a -1.2% percentage point impact on total North America organic net sales growth. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, total Kraft Heinz grew 11.9% versus prior year and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 2.3 percentage points, driven by adjusted gross profit margin expansion and partially offset by increased investments in SG&A. Adjusted gross profit margin increased approximately 400 basis points versus the third quarter 2022.\nThis expansion was driven by pricing previously executed to offset inflation, strong gross supply chain efficiencies, and positive mix in North America as growth platforms outpaced our lower margin meats business. When comparing to the third quarter of last year, it is important to note, that adjusted gross profit margin was the lowest quarterly margin of the year as we experienced peak dilutive impact of pricing to offset inflation compared to pre-pandemic levels, In third quarter 2019, our third quarter adjusted gross profit margin increased approximately 160 basis points.\nThis increase was primarily driven by the divestiture of our lower margin nuts and cheese businesses as well as improved productivity. In terms of adjusted EPS, we grew 14.3% or $0.09 versus the third quarter 2022, primarily driven by strong adjusted EBITDA performance partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. We have continued our disciplined approach to promotions, maintaining structurally lower levels relative to 2019. In the third quarter we reduced our volume sold on promotion in the US by seven percentage points versus 2019 compared to a four percentage point reduction by branded competition and now returns on investment. Have improved 15 percentage points over the same period.\nThis demonstrates that investments in our revenue management team and technology are paying off. In the fourth quarter, we're expecting a higher level of promotions. Which is consistent with our strategy to promote around key occasions and is contemplated in our guidance. We continue to generate higher gross efficiencies as we drive continuous improvement throughout our supply chain and we remain on track for our gross efficiency target of $2.5 billion by 2027. We closed the third quarter pacing well ahead of our $500 million annual target. Surpassing our 4% of COGS benchmark.\nMaterial improvement from approximately 3% of COGS in 2022. Turning to inflation, we see moderation but are still experiencing pockets of persistent inflation, including in labor, tomatoes, and sugar. We are now expecting mid single digit inflation for the full year. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, generating year-to-date free cash flow conversion of 68% while at the same. Time increasing investment in CapEx by approximately, $150 million over the same period versus 2022, supporting long-term growth of the business.\nThe majority of the improvement in free cash flow conversion versus the prior year is related to the lapping of the $620 million tax payment on divestiture proceeds in 2022. We also reduced net leverage to 2.9x, reaching our long-term target of approximately 3x. Turning to our outlook for the year, we now expect organic net sales for the fiscal year 2023 to be at the low end of our 4% to 6 range. At approximately 4% versus 2022, we are raising our constant currency adjusted EBITDA guidance to 5% to 7 growth versus 2022 from the prior range of 4% to 6 growth.\nOur constant currency adjusted EBITDA outlook includes a negative two percentage point impact from lapping the 53rd week in 2022. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect a one percentage point adjusted EBITDA headwind from currency on the full year. For adjusted gross profit margin we are increasing our expected year-over-year expansion to a range of 200 to 250 basis points from a prior range of 150 to 200 basis points. Current adjusted EPS, we are raising our guidance to a range of $2.91 to 2.99 reflecting 5% to 8 growth versus 2022 from our previous range of $2.83 to 2.91.\nOur adjusted EPS outlook includes negative currency impact of approximately $0.04 at current exchange rates, approximately a -$0.03 impact from non-cash pension and post-retirement benefits, and a -$0.06 impact from left in the 53rd week in 2022. Our outlook also contemplates an effective tax rate on adjusted EPS of 19% to 20. With that, let me pass it to Miguel for some closing comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO and Board Chair, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Andre. I would like to reiterate that I'm so proud of what we have achieved. We are generating accelerated profitable growth fueled by our three pillars. Share and volume trends are improving as a result of the action plans we implemented, and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, hitting our target net leverage of approximately three times. On a more personal note, this is my last earnings call as CEO of Kraft Heinz. It's been an honor and a privilege to lead this great iconic company and to play a role in this chapter of our transformation story. I'm absolutely thrilled and so excited about where Carlos will take this company. I could not be prouder to continue partnering with him next year as I continue in my role as a Board Chair.\nI thank those of you in the investments community for always asking me the hard question, for challenging us, for provoking us to think even more strategically about the business that we are so fortunate to lead. But most of all, I want to say thank you to our people, the 37,000 employees of Kraft Heinz who get up day in and day out, working so hard to bring our company purpose, let's make life delicious, to life. I can honestly say that each one of you has made my life more delicious. And I cannot wait to see how you and this company will further succeed under Carlos's dynamic leadership. Thank you for your time and interest in Kraft Heinz.",

Welcome to the Kraft Heinz Company Q2 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you and hello everyone. Welcome to our Q and A session for our Q2 2023 business update. During today's call, we may make forward looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans, expectations, strategy efforts, and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based upon how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.\nAdditionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO Miguel Patricio for some brief opening comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before opening the call for questions, I would like to thank the entire Kraft Heinz team. We have proven again that our strategy works, generating top line growth fueled by the three pillars while reinvesting margin gains into the business. While we did lose share in the quarter as price gaps have stayed wider for longer than we would have liked, we are managing the business for the long term and still generated mid single digit top line growth within the range of what we expected. As you may remember on the last earnings call, we introduced four action plans to drive share. We have seen those plans take hold, and they have led to improving results each month within the quarter, building momentum into the half of the year.\nThe continued execution of these action plans and the lapping of the past year's pricing are expected to drive improving volume trends in the half of 2023 and into 2024. Our results give me continued confidence in our strategy and in our business. I'm pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. With that, I have Andrea and Carlos joining me. Rafa is on a well-deserved vacation with his family. So let's open the call for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for your first question. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nI was hoping to dig into the promotional environment a little bit and some of the comments from your prepared remarks about branded competitors promoting at a higher level than Kraft Heinz. In your view, are branded competitors either over promoting or promoting in what you see as sort of an irrational way? Or is it more that KHC has not been able to ramp up its own merchandising activity yet to the extent needed, given some of the supply constraints and leading of the pricing actions? I guess, in other words, would you still expect the industry promotional levels to settle in below 19 levels or is there some concern building internally that competitive behavior could return to previous levels or beyond and that pricing could actually go negative at some point? Just trying to put some context around all of this. Thanks so much.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning Andrew. Thanks for the question. I will ask Carlos to answer since I believe it's related to the US retail.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning, Andrew. The way you kind of look at it is that if you look at the industry as a whole today, promotional levels are, as you said, still below 2019. What we are seeing is that our branded competitors are actually closer to those levels. And what we are working on is how do we continue to make sure that we act with a thought of protecting our margins and building the virtual cycle as we continue to improve on our marketing, continue to improve our services, our innovation, and importantly that we stay focused on driving the revenue management needed in order for us to be rational in terms of the effectiveness of our promotions. So if you look at our promotions this year, we actually have been very effective and efficient. We actually are generating attractive ROIs and investments.\nI think the numbers right now are up 15 points versus 2019. That's true because you know, the focus that we have on those agile AI driven revenue management tools that we are applying to making sure that every promotional does have that kind of true ROI return. Now on top of that, we're also making sure that we are working to maximize the opportunity on those promotions. So the quality of our merchandising, especially when you look at displays, continue to improve, and in fact our share of displays continue to see increasingly improvements over the first quarter. So I think altogether what I would say is our focus continues to be being very much leveraging our revenue management tool. Continue to focus on driving the investments in terms of marketing innovation, which you will know. We'll make sure that improve our view as we go into the second half of the year and on to 2024.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. You may proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks. You mentioned that the second half's sales growth rate will be more in line with the long term algorithm. Not to put too fine a point on it, just so we can model more accurately. I was just curious, does this mean you expect it to be within that 2% to 3% range that's your long term algo or just getting somewhat closer to it?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you. Ken [audio distortion], please.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning. As we have said in prepared remarks, we expect to gradually grow, go towards the long term model. It might happen that we're going to reach there between Q3 and Q4, but you should expect revenue to be gravitating towards that. Yeah.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, I'll follow up on that. And then I wanted to ask a follow up about capital allocation priorities, paying down debts. I think number three on that list, ahead of portfolio management. You highlighted that leverage is, I guess, more or less at your target. Does debt pay down thus move down a notch in importance? And I guess what I'm getting at, is there a scenario in which you might maybe start to buy back some stock again?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nWe are not changing our capital allocation policy now. So as we said, our priority has been to fund the business organically. People have been doing that very consistently. For us to maintain the dividends that we have, which provide a very attractive yield, is critical. And I think we feel good about our rating. The double-A rating we had in the past 15 months, M&A, as we said before, continues to be something that we actively look at. Like Miguel mentioned that multiple times, we have been very disciplined how we're doing that. But there is no change at this point. I mean, we're always taking into consideration market dynamics and our capital structure. But we don't have anything new to say at this point.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to stick with North America and the comments on promotions, but more so on delivery. Is there... Carlos, you highlighted the ROIs you're seeing, and you touched on the quality promos a bit. But to dig into that a bit more deeply versus history, how are you seeing the lift sort of changing from quality promo programs, the feature, the display relative to the pre-inflation era? Are you seeing a greater role for price reductions going forward? Does quality program still have the same degree of lift in terms of the influence of those drivers? Just trying to get a sense for as you lean into promo more in the back half of the programming, does pricing need to be a larger driver at the margin than you would have thought relative to feature and display a couple of quarters ago?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nJohn, thanks for the question. I will say I think some of the parts were a little hard to understand, but I think I got the gist of your question, you know, related to the second half that we think about promotional level. And we have said this in prior calls, and it is within our guidance. There is a step up that we'll do in promotional levels as we go into the second half of the year in selected categories, but always with a disciplined approach about the returns. But I would add too is that one of the things that we are able to do with our promotional investment to improve the effectiveness of those things of that investment is to make sure we leverage entire portfolio, and that we are thinking through how do we make sure we have the right product selection to the right audiences.\nSo for us, when you look at our whether it's barbecue season and we combine the different kind of categories that we can bring together as we think about back to school, in which we can bring in Lunchables and our Capri Sun business together. That idea of us being able to kind of go into the retail environment and actually leverage the entire scale of our business allows us to be more effective in terms of the returns of those promotions. So it's both looking at the true ROI through the AI management tools that we have, as well as maximizing our presence in store, leveraging our scale. The last thing I would say is as we think about going into the second half of the year, we're also seeing consumers behaving in a way in two different kind of camps.\nThey are the consumers who are going to be looking for those more, I would say, larger packs in which they're going to look for the value by looking at the total size of the products that they're going to get, and why we are introducing more products in the club type of packages, whether that is in our Mac and cheese, in our Lunchables. And you see that that is focused on driving that particular type of behavior with consumer effectiveness. There's also going to be a number of programs specifically to making sure that we are keeping consumers who are also focused on the cash flow within our categories, which is why we also have been introducing more of the smaller package, more of the dollar type of products that allows us to maintain our consumers within the category for longer. So we're approaching that in two prongs at the same time. Always looking at making sure we have the right ROI in every investments that we make.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nI apologize for my connection there. But just to clarify, if we think about price promotions versus sort of non price, the quality, the feature, the display, have you seen any sort of changes in terms of how deep you may have to go on price reductions going forward? Or do you think that kind of quality promo you'll still see attractive lifts? You don't really have to get deeper on pricing.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nBut what we have so far and here, what we have seen throughout this past three years is that we can have very attractive lifts without having to go as deep. And I think that when you look across, at least based on data from IRI and Circana, that's what we have been observing for ourselves. And I think that still remains true moving forward. The other thing that, as Carlos mentioned, that I think moving forward we're going to start to see more and more. Increasing importance of mix. [audio distortion] only doing more promotions or playing with these prices. So I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about MIC-related actions.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nOkay, thanks for your time.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks Jeff. [cross talk]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brian Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nGood morning. Hi. So I had, I guess I had just two questions. First one, just a clarification. I think we talked about margins. In the prepared remarks, that Q4 margins will be higher than the Q3. And just want to clarify, was that a comment on gross margin or EBITDA margin?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nIt ends up being both, but it's. Driven by the gross margin, [cross talk] and it's a seasonal factor because in Q4 we typically sell products. We overinvest in products with higher margins. If you look just at seasonality, aside from many other noise, Q2 is higher than Q3 because we ship a lot of barbecue season which has higher margin. We ship for summer, and then in Q4 we have items like cream cheese gravy and other items like that; they have very high margins. Desserts. So that's like just mix related.\n\nBrian Spillane\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, and then second question. I guess maybe this is related to what John Baumgartner was just asking, but maybe just more simplistically. You know, I think coming out of the first quarter you talked and this we're talking about North American retail, that one of the issues or one of the drivers of share losses was just price gaps. Right. That competitors, whether it's private label or branded in certain categories, hadn't followed your pricing. I guess I have two questions. One is, have price gaps narrowed or are your share gains that you've seen sequentially over the last couple of months happen without the price gaps closing? And then, when we think about the comments about expectations for volume growth in 2024, is that dependent also on normalized price gaps? So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, like, can you drive volume without those price gaps closing because you. Really can't control what your competitors do.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI think there's a couple of things. If we look versus the bottle in. The last two, three months, we have. seen the price gaps narrowing, moving favorably to us, so getting closer. So there is a certain contribution coming from that. And also all the other actions that we outlined, and very much right. So we had still some pockets of challenges in service that is now getting behind us. The only big remaining item is cold cuts that, as we said, are going to be recovered by the end of Q3 and Q4. We have innovation starting to ramp up. I think Kyle can give more color on that.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nYes, Brian, what I would add is that first of all, on the comment on private label, private label shares trends actually have been flat since you look at it. In fact, since H2 2022, even with increasing price gaps that we had after our pricing back in February. So we have taken that pricing to protect our margins, and some branded competitors have not followed. But at the same time, we continue to stay diligent on the way we think about the business. Now, in the points that Andrew just mentioned in terms of how we think about going forward, why is it that we see the moderation of our improvement? I'll give you three reasons.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe way kind of I look at it as we go into the second half of the year, into 2024 in the US retail, you know, number one, we're investing more in marketing, we're launching more innovation, and we are lapping the pricing actions as we go into second half of the year. Just to unpack at one more level, if you think about the innovation that we are seeing right now, we are actually building momentum as we go into the year as we are following this kind of two-pronged strategy innovation. First, you're going to see us continue to launch more disruptive innovation platforms. That includes things like our NotCo line of plant-based offerings, the new Crisp in the microwave which delivers great taste, and all the convenience, and the restaurant to retail platform.\nYou see that already with things like the IHOP coffee line. The second part of the innovation is also how do we take our existing brands into new spaces. Already we introduced the new frozen mac and cheese; we are expanding our Delimex and Taco Bell into more spaces within Mexican meals. And as we speak we're also launching new Oscar Mayer Scramblers as we continue to expand on the breakfast platform. So you see it's comprehensive in terms of how we are approaching innovation in order to continue to shape the categories as we increase shelf space and quality displays as we go forward. And that's already paying off.\nIn fact, just to give you a factoid, if you look at our Lunchables, we are creating a new golden wall in Lunchables as we go into a second half, and we are seeing that in some of our top customers that increases about 40% our space within the shelf. So again, it's not only thinking through the kind of promotion but also what we're doing in terms of our driving, volume, driving activities that are important as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nMorning.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nMorning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nIn North America, you pointed to your organic sales growth below consumption in certain parts of the portfolio like the grill platform, taste elevation, easy meals. What's driving that gap? And are you seeing a change in how retailers are managing inventory levels or shelf space for your brands?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThanks for the question. Let me start with the second part of that, which, you know, what we've seen right now is, if you look at Q2 and what we know today, we believe retail inventory is actually in pretty good shape.\nIn fact, on average, retail inventory for us were flat across the North America business. And where it did happen, it was in truly isolated pockets and earlier in the quarter. So that we actually saw that through the quarter to continue to improve. And so there's no. I don't see that as an ongoing situation as we go forward and that has been proven as we go through. The quarter. So I'm sorry, the first part of your question then was what?\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWhy were your sales below consumption across some of your platforms?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYes, no, thank you. I think if you look at our growth platforms which continue to drive our priority and our strategy, those actually in consumption remain very strong. Think about taste elevation growing 8% for the quarter, easy meals growing 6% in the quarter. In those cases, you know, the difference between organic and our consumption, where specifically in Easy Meals. Well, there was an inventory deload at the beginning part of the quarter that as I said earlier, you continue to improve as we go into as we go forward. I think for us is, you know, that remains our strategy remains, you know, the fact that the consumption continued to improve as we go through the quarter and the performance we saw in those, I think supports our continued focus on that strategy as we go into the second half of the year.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you.\nJust a follow-up question on your outlook for volumes improving in the back half. You pointed to moderating pricing growth as one of the drivers. But in the second quarter, pricing already moved past its peak, although volumes still softened. So why do you think that volumes will get better from here considering the competitive environment and some of the macro headwinds you highlighted, like the student loan repayments resuming? And I guess just related to that, how much of a driver do you think that the innovation that you talked about can be for volumes? Thanks.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYes. Our price in Q2, as you saw, was close to 11%. The reason why we saw higher elasticity and higher volume decline, as I said before, is because they expand the price gaps. Now moving forward, these price gaps are not getting worse. If anything, they are slightly getting better. So as you head into the second half, as we continue to lap price, we still have relevant price that happened last year. So that you're going to be lapping. We started now in Q3 and we had another round that implemented Q4 last year. So we have two rounds of price Q2 left in the United States alone. So beyond the pricing side, there are other things linked to our action plans that will help us to step up the share level that we are today. I think Carlos can speak about that.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe one thing I guess I would add to that too is that if you think about innovation, it's not just kind of the launching innovation, but what the innovation allows you to actually perform in market. So when I mentioned things like us being able to improve our presence and expanding our shelving on things like Lunchables because of the innovation and in Lunchables, for example, we are going to new locations. So we're doing, already announced yesterday, we have, we're doing pilots and taking Lunchables into the pro section. We're launching innovation in schools. We're expanding our presence in vending all that actually helps us strengthen our overall kind of performance in stores. We also are doing that in Philadelphia Cream Cheese. If you think about.\nA year ago, this is actually going to be the first holiday season in which we're going to go into the holidays with full service on Philadelphia Cream Cheese. And that's true for the last several years. So now we have an opportunity to actually truly kind of leverage our power of our brand, make sure we build a kind of our share of display as we go into this one of the most important seasons for Philadelphia business. We also see, too, in coffee. I mentioned earlier the fact that we had a new line with IHOP in terms of bringing coffee and new IHOP coffee into the stores. That actually allows us to also expand the coffee category into the stores and actually win additional spaces as we go into the second half of the year. So the innovation plays a couple of roles. It both attracts consumers and shapes our category to grow. But it also helped us expand our presence in order to increase the volume as well.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo, volume expected to improve as a function of lapping prices from last year. We still have two rounds to lap, innovation ramp beyond shelf resets, in the flow that I think would be favorable to us. That's an expectation, and service level recovery, particularly in focus.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cody Ross with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHi. Thank you for taking our questions. Just want to focus on gross margin and specifically your inflation outlook. What's driving you to move your inflation outlook lower this year?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nSo commodities in general continue to come down, and as hedges roll off and our contracts get adjusted, some of them are based on indexes. We have seen costs continue to move favorably, which has been allowing us to expand the gross margin and by consequence have been allowing us to accelerate the investment behind the business, particularly marketing, R&D, and technology.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAny particular commodities?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nThat are declining?\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nYes. That you would call out, that's driving that?\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nI don't think there is a particular one. I mean, your portfolio is so, so large, so many commodities back to business that there is a general movement of commodities coming down the. Tomato, potato that had bad crops and sweetness. Other than that, we are seeing generally commodities moving favorably.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nUnderstood. And then, in light of the declining commodities or your outlook for inflation, do you think you took too much price, given you said you took price ahead of competitors and they have not followed? And then I'll pass it on.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nNo, I would say, let me answer that one. I would do everything again. I mean. We had very high inflation, and we are leaders in the vast majority of categories where we play, and it's our role as leader to try to compensate these price increases with. Disinflation with price increases. So I would do everything again. I mean, we can always go back on price if we think we have to or when we have to, but we had to lead price increases. So yeah, that would be my answer to you.\n\n[Company Representative] (Kraft Heinz)\n\nCompany Representative, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe only thing I would say is, remember that we have been very. Systematic in terms of pricing to offset the inflation, and that's what we have done. We have priced ahead of inflation. If you look at our gross margin Q2, it's still slightly below 2020, 2021 levels. And the other thing that is worth mentioning, the gross margin, we show that in prepared remarks. Our efficiency plan is trending very well, and we are ahead of; we are pacing ahead of the $500 million that we have said we'll deliver by year. It's another good news.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me build on that point from Andrea. I think that the only sustainable way to keep increasing our investments behind the brand and to grow our volumes and shares for the future is by improving gross margins and investing back in marketing, R and D, and technology, which is exactly what we are doing because we had very high, very good gross margin this quarter. We could increase marketing this quarter by 23%. We could increase R and D by 10%. We could increase our investments in technology. And as Andrea said, that was possible because on one side, yes, we had price increases, but on the other side, because we are every month delivering more and more efficiencies in supply, we are excited with that part as well. And you know.\nI expect that. People noted the difference, as well, in how they're operating because we have been intentionally opting to use those resources to put back in the long term behind marketing the technology. We could have opted to be adding more promotions, but that would not make sense because we are getting promotions to low return. We are thinking about the long term here. I hope people notice the difference of how it might be. The game happy plays very different.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nThat will wrap it up for today's Q and A session. Thank you all for your questions. I will turn it over to Miguel who will just kind of wrap up the call for us.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nI just want to thank you all for the time, for the attention, and the patience with us. So thank you so much, and hope to talk to you and to see you very soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Kraft Heinz Company Q1 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a Q&A session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will hear a message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw the question, simply press star one one again, and be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations. The floor is yours.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nThank you, and hello everyone, and welcome to our Q&A session for our Q1 2023 Business Update. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts, and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risk and uncertainties.\nPlease see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for some brief opening comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nWell, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone joining us today. We are proud, proud, and confident. We are so confident that we are raising our guidance on EBITDA and earnings. We are so confident that we are increasing our investments in marketing and in R&D by $100 to 150 million versus budget, which represents a solid double-digit growth versus previous year. These results are not a coincidence. They are because of our confidence. We have been consistently saying that we'll grow through Emerging Markets, and we grew 23% this quarter. We'll grow through Foodservice globally, and we grew about 29% this quarter.\nWe'll grow through our priority growth platforms in the US, Easy Meals, and Taste Elevation, where we had double-digit growth. The rest of the portfolio has to free up resources to invest in our strategy. These results are possible not only because of our strategy, but because of everything that is behind our strategy. Let me start with people. Today, we have a great team and a very engaged team. Speed, well, agility is a big word for us, and the Pods that we have in place are transforming the company in innovation, in supply, in manufacturing, procurement, in sales, in logistics.\nTwo good examples of that is innovation, where we have now a much stronger pipeline for the future, and we reduced the time of innovating from two years to a couple of months. Or in supply, that, through the Pods plus the partnership with Microsoft and the usage of artificial intelligence, we are improving our planning, our service levels, reducing waste, reducing fines. We are in a very different place today. Finally, efficiencies.\nWhen we announced three years ago a $2 billion in five years of gross savings, there were a lot of people that were skeptical. That represented $400 million per year. We not only delivered this number in three years in a row, but we are now increasing this bar to $500 million a year. With that, I have here with me today André, our CFO, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, our Zone President for North America, and Rafael, our Zone President for International, that are joining me. Please, we are ready for the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, that is star one one if you have a question. One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Operator. Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask, I guess, two questions related to the US. One is, I think, as we kind of strip out the Foodservice piece and look at what's underneath, it looks like there's a bit of a mismatch, I should say, between kind of what we were seeing in the Nielsen data and what would have been reported underlying. So just trying to understand if there was anything there relative to timing of shipments or promotions that might have affected the cadence.\nAnd then second, if you can just talk a little bit about, in the US specifically, kind of how you're seeing the promotional activity or the promotional environment as we kind of head into some of the big summer holidays. You know, is it intensified? Is it kind of in line with your expectations?Just kind of how you're seeing those summer holidays set up, please?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndré, please.\n\nAndré Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nOkay. Good morning, Bryan. Good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. Look, when I look at the US performance, I don't think there is nothing abnormal happening this quarter. The inventory load was immaterial, given we already landed at the end of Q4, as you said before. So it's really a function of the sellout and the Foodservice, which performed very well in the quarter in the US zone. So maybe people underappreciate a little bit the impact of that. I believe it has something to do also with the fact that last year with Omicron and things, everything was shut down.\nSo that impacted the sellout in retail across the industry at the beginning of the quarter, but also helped a lot Foodservice to have a very strong performance. When it comes to promotions, as we have said all along, we expect an increase in promotions year to go. That's what has been in the guidelines from the beginning, so nothing changing there in that regard. Always in a prudent way and always emphasizing that well before 2019 levels. You saw in Q2 how well we are doing in terms of continuing to improve our alignment with the tools that we have in place. So not yet done. I'll give some color. It depends on which colors to give some color on the promotional environment.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nZone President for North America, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe one thing I guess I would add, Bryan, to what André just said is, as you've mentioned, the ROI has continued to improve, and let me give you a little more color as to what's behind that. You know, we have spoken about the Agile@Scale and how that has re-engineered kind of Kraft Heinz, and part of that is us creating ownable agile revenue management tools that actually allows us to improve the returns of our promotions. So, like for example, we have a trade management system that we created in-house, and it gives us real-time access to essentially over 10,000 promotional events.\nAnd then what we do is we actually create digital tools that leverage that large amount of data to provide insights and recommendations in a very simple way. Now, those solutions then help us to make sure that allows us to figure out, what is the right depth of discount, what is the right time of the year, and what are the right promotional tactics we have seen? So, if you look at our Q1 numbers, we saw about a 10-point improvement in ROI in this particular quarter versus what we saw a year ago. And it's about 15 points if you compare that to 2019 of Q1. So again, our ownable tools continue to help us make sure that we are driving that investment.\nSo, as we go forward, our continued focus is to make sure that we invest in the business, that we are focused on the innovation of our business and marketing, driving that stronger quality with those event-based activities that really have the high ROI. Rafael, I don't know if anything you wanted to comment on what you're seeing in international promotions.\n\nRafael Oliveira\n\nZone President for International, Kraft Heinz\n\nIt's not very different than what you described, Carlos. I think, and what André mentioned, we might see a bit of an increase. We'll see a bit of an increase in some markets and promotional activity the year to go, but nothing significant that is not included in our guidance. Thanks, Bryan.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for the question. One moment for our next. It comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Food Producers, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. I think you outperformed expectations, obviously, in the Q1 on organic sales growth and maintained the fuller outlook, I guess, potentially implying slower go-forward trends maybe than originally planned for. Is there something you're seeing in the market that necessitates this adjustment, or is this more a function of sort of conservatism? And I appreciate the fuller outlook is already above your sort of long-term algorithm.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nHi, Andrew. André, maybe you want to answer that question.\n\nAndré Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nSure. Good morning, Andrew. Good to hear from you, too, and thanks for the question. So there is nothing that changed expectations. We are holding the guidance in top line. If I look at versus what I believe the market was expecting, we overdeliver quite a lot in the International Zone, which I think people still, I think, don't fully appreciate the impact of the Emerging Markets growth in our portfolio and the Foodservice portion of the international market in our portfolio as well. They've been performing extremely well, as Miguel indicated, and they continue to do so.\nMomentum is very solid. When it comes to the US, nothing changed in our internal expectations. We just think that at this moment it's good to be prudent given macroeconomic uncertainties about interest rates and how consumers might respond on that, but nothing special.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Food Producers, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question, please. It comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nKen Goldman\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Food Producers and Retailers, JPMorgan\n\nHi. There's been some anecdotal evidence that consumers are beginning to trade down in terms of where they're doing their grocery shopping, either going from premium channel to more mainstream or mainstream to discount. I'm curious if this is something you're starting to see as well, even if it's just on the margin. And if so, is it in any way, I guess, informing your decisions about product mix, new products, you know, things like that?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nMaybe André and Carlos can comment.\n\nAndré Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nGood morning. Look, as you have seen since last year, the channel migration has started. So we don't see like an abnormal accelerated trend toward that. We have seen consistently now for several months the Dollar channel and the Mass Merchandising gaining ground consistently. And this is not a new phenomenon. We have been prepared for that for a while. So I'll pass to Carlos if he should talk about the type of activities we are doing in those channels, but we don't see anything abnormal happening, and it's expected.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nZone President for North America, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. What I would add in terms of color, I guess, first in retail, I mean, there have been some channel shifts in which we expected. And for the lower-income consumers, this means kind of moving to more value-focused retailers or into Dollar channel, and as André said, we anticipated this. Now, for higher-income consumers, that also means thinking about what are the places that they can go in instead of maybe the specialty retailers to more traditional grocery and club. And for us, what we're looking to do is actually making sure that we have the right solutions for those that are specific channels.\nSo, whether that is more club-sized packagings and brands like Mac & Cheese, and JELL-O and adding more dollar SKUs so that consumers who are stretched are actually able to stay within the category. And then, as we talked earlier, being savvy about how we go about our promotional activities in certain categories so that we can, in fact, be there with consumers with the right overall kind of meal solution. So if you think about what a grilled cheese sandwich can do with Kraft Singles, what a Kraft Mac & Cheese can do in terms of families, what Oscar Mayer hotdogs can do, us being able to be there for those kind of meal solutions is part of our answer as well.\nThe one other thing I will say is if you look at that same channel shift within Foodservice, we're also making sure that we are adjusting to for that. We are seeing how our business continues to grow in QSR, and for us, it's continued to grow that business, and we are doing that, and we're growing share of that business as well. It's making sure that consumers are shifting from certain restaurants to QSR. We are making sure we are there for them too, to continue to drive our products and continue to drive our growth, which is the way resulted in Q1. Thank you for the question, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for spotting me in. Two quick questions. First, the gross margin outlook for the year. Great to see it moving up. It implies that your gross margin for the year is going to look a lot like your first quarter, which would, of course, mark an end to what has been like a sequential build with every quarter moving higher. I guess my question is, why would that be the case, especially given that cost inflation appears to be moderating?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nToday. Sorry, Jason. Could you repeat the question? You're talking about the trajectory of the gross margin throughout the year?\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, yeah. Gross margin's been building sequentially, right? You even have a chart in one of your slides showing it every quarter moving higher. Your full-year guidance implies that it kind of goes sideways, that you're going to finish the year at a margin rate very comparable to the Q1. So my question is, why shouldn't we expect it to continue to grind a little higher as cost inflation moderates?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So, the gross margin we will increase a little bit throughout the next quarter, so we should see Q4 will be the highest one. Q2 goes a little bit sideways. There is a component of mix in our portfolio as well, given the type of products that sell more during Q1 and Q4 in comparison to last sales in December. But beyond that, no, because the costs are continue to ease. The price, we put a lot of price in the middle of the quarter, so we have full reflection of that now in Q2. But remember as well, and then we're going to start to lift something from last year, right? But no, the gross margin will gradually increase throughout the year.\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. That's helpful.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nThe expectation that you did is because of product mix, which mostly is on net.\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then free cash flow, can you tell us what your outlook is for the full year in terms of conversion or level, however you want to communicate that? And I know you talked about working inventory down. It built a lot last year, and obviously, there's still a heavy usage of cash again in Q1. How much of that do you think we could get back out over the course of this year, or do we have to kind of bleed into next year before we can normalize those levels?\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. So free cash flow, as we said last quarter, we expect this year to close in the 75% to 80% range, which is in line with our plan. We even talk about that in CAGNY, and then we expect by 2025 to go up to 100%. This has to do maybe with the CapEx ramp-up that we have done this year and next year, which is close to 4%, and then expect to wind down. Working capital, yes. It was a drag last year, and in Q1 was also a negative hit. We prioritize service level recovery because, I mean, the payback is obviously there. What I can tell you is we have a very robust plan, very robust plan to bring the inventory down to the level before. We have been working with buffers.\nI mean, everybody in the industry does give a lot of uncertainties about supply chain volatility and resilience, but we have a very clear line of drive path to bring it down throughout the year. So the expectation for inventory is to land the year at similar levels to where we were at the pre-pandemic level as a percentage of COGS.\n\nJason English\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nSenior Analyst US Consumer of Food and Healthy Lifestyle, Mizuho Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to promotion in the US, Carlos. There were a few categories that drove the bulk of US share loss in Q1, but I think those are also categories where your promotion levels really seem below branded competitors. So is it fair to isolate the share losses to reduce promo and lingering supply chain issues, or are there other factors in play outside of promo and supply chain?\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nZone President for North America, Kraft Heinz\n\nNo, listen, John, I think that's a fair assessment, but I guess let me start with the fact that as we think about growing the business, you know, we have a very disciplined approach of how we're going to do that. So we are, as Miguel mentioned, we're going to focus on our growth platforms and the growth they have in our portfolio. We want to make sure we're building innovation that's disruptive and that we continue to adapt the core to the consumer trends. And we're going to manage the margin with efficiency to reinvest in the business with, you know, whether double-digit investments in marketing, technology, and R&D. And as you said, there are a few kind of categories where we saw a slowdown.\nAnd let me remind you too that we took pricing in the middle of the quarter as we were catching up to margins. So, if you think about a couple of those categories, let me highlight a couple of them. One, cream cheese, for example. We did see some supply chain challenges that we had in the quarter. Those are things that prevented us from really taking advantage of the Easter time period and will be, and in fact, we are now in a position that we'll be better off as we go into the year to go. Another one I'll tell you is cold cuts, in which we began the year with a low inventory situation in our business.\nAgain, as we think about cold cuts by the end of the summer, we should be in a much better place in terms of completely supplying the overall business. So that is a sense of the short-term supply constraint. It's a well assessment of how we see the quarter as well. The one thing I would add, too, is that there are places where, in categories, we're simply not going to be chasing volume down. So if you think about bacon, it's a category that, you know, we are, that probably was about a point of headwinds, you know, when you look at the data and consumer data, but we're simply not going to be chasing volume that is not profitable.\nSo that gives you a sense about how kind of we're looking at business and what drove that Q1.\n\nJohn Baumgartner\n\nSenior Analyst US Consumer of Food and Healthy Lifestyle, Mizuho Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks, Carlos. On the international side, your categories, I guess, historically, your categories have been pretty defensive in terms of demands or economic weakness. I'm curious, you're doing a lot of good things, ramping distribution, launching new products. But as you transform the business with growth in Foodservice, the new sauces, the beef partnership with ABI, how do you think about the marginal structure?\nAre these new outlets and products introducing greater volatility into the business, or do they benefit you in that they reduce some of the impact of private label and price sensitivities in places like the UK and Europe? How do you think about the net resilience you're building outside the US? Thank you.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nRafael, do you want to answer that one?\n\nRafael Oliveira\n\nZone President for International, Kraft Heinz\n\nYeah. No, happy to. I think we need to differentiate a bit how we're growing in Emerging Markets and the Developed Markets across International. I mean, what you described probably applies a lot to the Developed Markets because, as you know, as we've been talking about, across Emerging Markets, we are growing significantly, and the go-to-market and the opportunity we have in execution of this go-to-market has been significant and continues to be. On the Developed Market, I mean, it's a mix.\nI mean, we've been renovating our portfolio significantly in all the places, especially you mentioned Europe, and then launching products that have been incremental, not only sauces on the Easy Meals category. Those are the two platforms that we've been growing, especially the sauces of Taste Elevation. So this has been the focus.I mean, right now is delivering the results that we expect and, again, providing the gains that we need and the resources we need from the core and the innovation growth that's coming from those introductions.\n\nAndré Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nJust to add to that, just to add to that, if you remember, again, International Zone, you have the Developed Market with the Emerging Markets, right? Emerging Markets is 10% of our business. We expect to grow double digits like we have been doing. And the recent game plan about expanding distribution, but it has to be done in a profitable way. And you might have noticed in the prepared remarks that since we start to require from our Emerging Markets a certain level of minimum ROIC or EVA, I think we're seeing a very healthy balance between top and bottom line. And we saw very significant gross margin expansion in Emerging Markets across the board in the quarter.\nAnd I think with expectation for that to continue to improve. So we feel very good that part of the investments that Miguel has said about $100 to 150 million, which is going across marketing, R&D, technology, and in some cases, sales headcount. But in the case of Emerging Markets, we are accelerating the go-to-market expansion. Again, we always keep our stability top of mind here. We don't want to grow without delivering returns.\nAnd on the Developed Markets, not only in the US, but also in selected countries being developed, we are using part of this incremental investments to reset the marketing levels and accelerate in some cases renovation agendas. So we feel very good because that allow us to build the, continue to build the future growth of the company.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nLet me mention one thing that you said, that you mentioned that entering new categories with innovation. You're right.I mean, we launched in UK, the Heinz Pasta Sauce, and in a couple of months, we achieved 7% share, and we continue growing. We just launched a Vodka Pasta Sauce with Absolut that is being extremely successful in the market. But it's not only in Europe. I mean, if you look at the profile of innovation that we are having right now in the US, it's very different from the past. In the past, we had a lot of innovation, but really not incremental. It was very cannibalistic. Just think about what we've been launching, like NotCo, that we are going to.\nIt's going to be national during the summertime. It's basically 80% incremental to the category. Or Just Spices that we just launched in the US through direct-to-consumer, which is spices, which is a huge market where we don't play today. Or Tingly Ted's that we are launching globally throughout the year, that is in hot sauces, that is a pretty growing category that we were not playing. Or even Kraft Mac & Cheese Frozen that we are launching, that we are leader in Kraft Mac & Cheese, with Kraft Mac & Cheese.\nWe have a very strong portfolio of frozen, but we didn't have an option of Kraft Mac & Cheese Frozen. And I can continue this list and tell you about HOMEBAKE and CRISP for microwave, really, really incremental innovation that will start to change the profile of innovation in our company.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment, please. A question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Powers\n\nResearch Analyst of US Consumer Staples, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the supply topic. It sounds like you've made good headway and have good visibility to improvements going forward, but I guess just framing that, is there a way to think about what the supply challenges in Q1 cost you? And then as you move forward with those supply bottlenecks resolved, do you kind of resume a more normal growth trajectory in those categories with those issues behind you? Do you sort of accelerate a catch-up over the next couple of quarters as you dig out of the hole? Or is it more prudent for us to think about, you know, a more gradual ramp of recovery, again, as those issues abate? Thank you.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAndré, maybe Carlos, then.\n\nAndré Maciel\n\nCFO, Kraft Heinz\n\nOkay. Good morning, Stephen. Thanks for your question. Look, we obviously expect, as some of the solutions get sold, as Carlos indicated, we expect over time to reduce inventory that we built, and that should come together with some improvement in the top-line performance. But again, it's all contemplated in our guidance here. Remember that our priority in the US is to grow in the growth platforms. The priority growth platform has performed very well in Q1, particularly Taste Elevation and Easy Meals.\nBut we expect categories like, cream cheese to improve their performance throughout the year as those problems get behind us. In other categories, like in meats, as Carlos also said, not necessarily we're going to see a strong acceleration in growth because we're also trying to be prudent about having the profitability there. So it's about having the right balance. But yes.\n\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera\n\nZone President for North America, Kraft Heinz\n\nI mean, not much to add. What I would say is we continue to see the improvements in service levels. So just to give you a, you know, kind of a framework, last year, I think at this time of the year, we were kind of in the mid-80s. We are now in the mid-90s, actually closer to the high levels of 90s as we exit Q1. So I feel like we do have a couple of categories that I mentioned earlier where we have some isolated challenges, but overall, the business, we are still in the right trajectory to continue to service the business the right way as we go forward.\n\nStephen Powers\n\nResearch Analyst of US Consumer Staples, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAnne-Marie Megela\n\nHead of Global Investor Relations, Kraft Heinz\n\nOperator, that'll be it for the Q&A session. I'd like to turn it over to Miguel for some closing comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO, Kraft Heinz\n\nAll right. I just want to thank you for the time you spent with us, and looking forward to sharing more information and more results with you. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And with that, we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And the fourth quarter was no exception.\nYou can see the momentum building across our business, service levels, and market share trends are improving, base volumes are positive. We are outpacing the competition in Foodservice and Emerging Markets and by a lot. And importantly, we continue to invest for growth. Once again, we have unlocked efficiencies over $400 million this year, and this allow us to invest in new tools and capabilities for our teams and new product innovation for our consumers.\nFrom a pricing perspective, 99% of all needed pricing has already been announced for 2023. As we look to the rest of the year, we have no current plan to announce new pricing in North America, Europe, Latin America and most of Asia. I am very optimistic and very excited about how we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. With that, I've had Andre, Carlos and Rafa to join me. So let's open the call for the Q&A.",

This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2022 business update.\nDuring the following remarks, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.

We've also scheduled a separate live question-and-answer session with analysts. You can access our earnings release, supplemental materials and audio of our question-and-answer session at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. A replay of the question-and-answer session will be available following the event through the same website. With that, I will turn it over to Miguel.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nChair & CEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie, and thanks to all of you joining us today. Let me start by saying that our intense focus on delivering value and convenience at a time when consumers need it most is serving us well, and we expect our investment agenda will further improve our offerings, strengthen our brands and continue to make us more competitive as we move forward.\nWe delivered yet another quarter of strong results, results we achieved while successfully navigating a dynamic environment, enabled by the continued advancement of our long-term strategy. With these proven capabilities, continued success along our transformation journey and a stronger balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth and generate attractive returns for our shareholders.\nSo let's dive into our results. Our organic net sales have been growing at a 6.4% compound annual growth rate compared to the third quarter of 2019. And versus last year, we generated 11.6% growth in the third quarter. We see solid and growing demand for our brands, powerful brands that resonate with the consumer.\nLooking to our adjusted EBITDA results, we are offsetting record level inflation through price realization and supply chain growth efficiencies. We generated $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Compared to the third quarter 2021, adjusted EBITDA was down 5.5% or a positive 0.5% on our ongoing business following the nuts and cheese divestiture in 2021. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation is strong, considering a $1 billion headwind we experienced from rebuilding our inventories as well as a tax payment paid on our natural cheese divestiture in the second quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow conversion was 37%. The inventory rebuild and tax payments negatively impacted it by 53 percentage points. For the third quarter, free cash flow conversion was 68%.\nOur organic net sales acceleration is fueled by our 3 pillars of growth: demand across our GROW platforms in North America, including Taste Elevation remains very strong; our Foodservice, both in North America and in our International zone is growing faster than the industry; and Emerging Markets accelerated the pace of organic net sales growth once again.\nLet's take a look at each one. Our organic growth strategy is working. Total North American zone organic net sales have grown 10.9% versus the third quarter of 2021, and our GROW platforms, which make up more than 60% of the North American zone business have grown approximately 12% over the same time period. And our growth strategy has been working consistently since we began our transformation with our portfolio, delivering resilient and elevated growth versus the pre-pandemic period. Total zone organic net sales have grown at a 6.3% CAGR versus the third quarter of 2019, and our GROW platforms have grown approximately 8% over the same time period.\nSo what is at the heart of this success? Well, our iconic brands, such Heinz, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Lunchables. In fact, over half of our business comes from 8 powerful brands, including the ones I just mentioned. We continue to see relatively low elasticity in our North America business. We grew organic net sales almost 11%, with pricing contributing approximately 15 percentage points and a volume/mix decline of approximately 4 percentage points in the third quarter.\nSequentially, this reflects an increase in pricing of more than 2 percentage points, while volume/mix was down only about 1 percentage point versus the second quarter. Consumption in the U.S. specifically continues to increase. It's up to 9.2% in the third quarter. We are growing and gaining share in categories where we have made investments in our brands, whether through renovation, elevated marketing or additional capacity to meet increased demand.\nTake Lunchables and Kids Single-Serve Beverages, for example, both of which were cornerstones of our recent back-to-school campaign. Lunchables grew 23% and Kids Single-Serve Beverages grew 20%, with both gaining market share.\nAnd Delimex and Kraft Mac & Cheese cups, brands in which we made CapEx investments to boost capacity, both grew 18% in the third quarter and are gaining share as well. Based on our most recent consumption data, we saw an improvement of approximately 10 basis points on our non-mix adjusted share change versus the second quarter. On a mix-adjusted basis, there was a decline of approximately 10 basis points.\nEarlier this year, Carlos shared our strategies to improve market share performance, and we continue to see progress in many of our categories, despite the supply chain challenges our industry still faces, and those challenges are not minor. We have managed through previous labor availability challenges and improved our overall equipment effectiveness. Now approximately 80% of the supply chain challenges we face today are due to the upstream supply disruptions on ingredients and packaging materials. We are working with our supplier partners to address these issues.\nOur market share performance is closely linked to our service levels and on-shelf availability. In categories that are not constrained like Condiments and Sandwich Cheese, we continue to grow and gain market share. The same applies to business where we faced supply constraints that have been solved, like Lunchables and Kids Single-Serve Beverages, where we saw significant share gains in the third quarter. However, it's not a coincidence that our 2 biggest drivers of share losses, Powdered Beverages and Frozen Snacks and Appetizers are both supply constrained. And in these 2 categories, we are seeing on-shelf availability significantly below the category average.\nThere is certainly more work to be done. As we continue to resolve our supply issues, particularly around upstream ingredients and packaging materials, we can harness the power of our brands to drive consumption and to grow market share. As we have highlighted before, our broad portfolio of iconic brands is balanced with our market share by consumer base, not over indexed to any one of the income levels. With price ladders across much of our business, we are well positioned to serve consumers across all income levels. What we are seeing is continued consumption growth across all income levels in the third quarter. As a matter of fact, year-over-year market share for every income level increased relatively to the first half of the year.\nLet's now move to our second pillar of growth, Foodservice. This is a strategically important and underpenetrated channel for us. It grew double digits in the third quarter in both our North America and International zones, and we continue to gain share. Foodservice channel growth has historically outpaced the retail industry by 1.5x, and we believe there is a lot of white space to capture.\nThe channel provides a strategic platform for us to test and learn on innovation before scaling up in retail. It's also an outstanding marketing vehicle, and it serves as a consumer trial engine for our brands, especially in geographies where we have lower retail penetration. Much of our current growth in Foodservice is coming from strong partnerships with quick service restaurants.\nIn the United States, we are only in about 25 of the top 50 QSRs, and our food service business is 1/3 smaller as a percentage of our Taste Elevation platform in the international zone than in the North American zone, even though the retail side is comparable. As you can see, there are significant opportunities for further expansion in Foodservice across markets.\nLet's turn now to our third pillar of growth, Emerging Markets. Here, we accelerated our pace of organic growth, largely to the global recognition of the Heinz brand, all while growing our distribution network. We've been expanding our presence in Emerging Markets through a sustainable and repeatable go-to-market model, which is delivering accelerated growth. As you can see, organic net sales for our International zone grew 14% in the quarter versus Q3 2021.\nWithin the zone, the Emerging Markets grew at a faster pace, 21%, a higher rate than last quarter. And for those countries where we have already activated our go-to-market model, organic net sales grew 28% over the same period. This growth was largely driven by an increase in retail distribution points.\nIn fact, the go-to-market model have allowed us to nearly double our distribution points in those markets since we launched it in 2019. With the opportunity we have in emerging markets, we are investing aggressively to expand our go-to-market strategy. Those countries where we have activated this strategy represents approximately 60% of our emerging markets organic net sales for Q3. We plan to increase this to about 75% by year-end.\nLet's now take a closer look at how we are navigating today's headwinds. We are seeing certain costs beginning to level off even though inflation remains at high levels. Service is still challenging, but our teams do continue to make progress, while at the same time, unlocking efficiencies. And in this tough environment, it's critical for us to deliver relevant solutions for consumers in partnership with our retail customers.\nOn the supply chain front, we continue to make progress, but there is more work to be done. We have increased production versus last year for the last 3 quarters, with Q3 up 6.1%. Service levels continued in the low 90s at the end of the third quarter. This is better than where we were earlier in this year, but still below where we want it to be.\nWe continue to execute on our efficiency plan, that is to free up more than $2 billion in variable costs by 2024. Our evolving supply chain allows us to anticipate, adapt and optimize despite constantly changing conditions. Let me give you some examples. Our teams look ahead to anticipate problems before they become critical issues. For example, in Europe, the entire industry remains strained with the evolving energy crisis. To maintain our energy supply, we have installed generators in our factories. This helps preserve energy continuity in order to keep serving our customers and consumers should we face a natural gas shortage.\nThe 1 constant is change, and our teams have been great at adapting to ever shifting conditions. On an almost daily basis, we are faced with a shortage of certain ingredients or packaging materials. One good example is the CO2 shortage that the industry has been experiencing. Our team responded in several ways to curb the need for CO2, including CO2 recapture and recycling, leveraging new technologies to extend our existing supply. And we are constantly looking to optimize our processes to drive efficiencies.\nI'm especially excited about the investments we are making in factory automation and vitalization. Not only will this increase overall production levels for us but should lower variable costs and give us the ability to flex our supply chain with consumer demand. We are uniquely positioned to provide solutions for today's consumer. There are some major trends that have emerged. Hybrid work environments are becoming the norm with many consumers bringing food from home to eat at their offices. As families return to daily routines, there is less time to prepare dinner. And importantly, convenient foods that are filling are more important to them than ever, particularly as they are looking to make their paychecks go further.\nWe have seen 4 priority needs emerging with consumers: on the go, easy prep, filling food and price point optionality, and Kraft Heinz is very well positioned to deliver value to our consumers with solutions as Lunchables and Kraft Mac & Cheese cups that are made specifically to be taken on the go, Blue Box Mac & Cheese and Delimex Frozen Apps that are easy to prepare, foods like Heinz Beanz and Kraft Mac & Cheese that fill you up. And an array products that provide different price points options, some in either smaller packages with lower price points like our Lunchables dollar tax or larger packs with greater per-unit value like our Capri Sun variety pack.\nAnd we had choices across the pricing ladder. For example, we recently launched HP Baked Beans in the U.K., a value alternative for beans consumers. The value we create through our brands is why we are confident that consumer demand for our products will remain strong. And in an environment where consumers are stretched and has many options, this is particularly important. And due to the strength of our brands, we are competing effectively against private label. We have lower private label exposure relatively to the industry and to our historic levels, thanks to our divestiture of nuts and natural cheese in 2021.\nOur market share is relatively flat versus the prior year, while private label continues to gain share from other branded competitors. Both Kraft Heinz and private label improved share performance in Q3 relatively to the first half of the year, while branded competition is down. So as you can see, the private label growth is not coming from us, rather, Delimex from other branded players.\nWhile we continue to navigate this difficult moment, we are not losing focus on the long term. As we think about the long term, one of the most important aspects is ESG and our responsibility to consumers, our employees and the planet. Last week, we released our 2022 ESG report. It reflects the progress we are making toward our goals from reducing waste, energy and water consumption, which reduces our impact on the environment while improving our bottom line, to our pledge of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and ensuring we have a diverse workforce.\nWhile our 2022 ESG report celebrates our progress, it's also a transparent recognition that we still have more to do to achieve the future we want to see. One of my biggest aspirations when I joined Kraft Heinz was to build a culture of creativity, and that is happening. We are elevating our marketing to strengthen the equity of our brands and drive earned media.\nWe have the necessary tools from access to proprietary first-party data to an AI-enabled insights, to Kraft-O-Matic, to our in-house creative agency, The Kitchen. By increasing the relevance and impact of our creative, we are adding more and more earned media coverage amplified by our huge consumer base. This year, we have executed 6 activations with more than 1 billion earned impression each, and we have seen an increased 60% in brand campaigns versus last year.\nLet me give you some color on this, some examples on how we are doing that. With Halloween next week, what better way to get into the spirit than with Toby the Veggie Vampire and Heinz Tomato Blood? And speaking of Halloween, we recently launched the Heinz Black Garlic Mayo in 13 different markets in Australia. It was sold out in just 1 week. On Oscar Mayer, we asked consumers if our popsicle cold dog was a genius or not. You know what? They overwhelmingly decided that yes.\nWho hasn't experienced dribble of ketchup while enjoying a delicious burger? Well, now it's fashion, with 100% of the proceeds going to the nonprofit Rise Against Hunger. We created the first ever Velveeta-based cocktail, bringing our consumers the cheesy goodness that they love and generated 2.2 billion impressions in the process. We finally launched our first ever pasta sauce in the U.K. under our Heinz brand, I know, it was 150 years late.\nSpeaking of U.K., there are a few things more iconic than Heinz Beanz brand. Through our Beanz Liberation campaign, we have freed Heinz Beanz from the can and increased distribution sevenfold on our new Heinz Beanz innovations. It's unBEANlievable. As you can see, we are inserting Kraft Heinz into the cultural commentary and increasing our reach far more than we could do through paid media alone. While the strength of our market is critical, so too is unlocking the value of our partnerships. They accelerated the speed of our transformation and capturing more white space than we could alone.\nThrough our joint venture with NotCo, I'm excited to announce that our first Kraft Heinz NotCo product, melty, delicious, plant-based American cheese slices has launched in a test market. We achieved this with record speed and using our agile ways of working, we created a superior consumer offering by combining the power of our brands and NotCo's unique artificial intelligence technology. And as we turn our focus from renovation to innovation, you'll be hearing much more from us about what we have in the pipeline.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Andre to share more detail on our third quarter financial results and to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Miguel. In the third quarter, we balanced our organic net sales growth while protecting adjusted EBITDA dollars, all while facing many of the challenges Miguel spoke about. We delivered strong results in the third quarter across both of our reporting units, North America and International.\nKraft Heinz grew organic net sales 11.6% in the third quarter with double-digit growth across both reporting segments. In Europe, we delivered double-digit growth even though the region has been more affected by higher inflation and constrained resource availability. In terms of constant currency adjusted EBITDA, our decline of 4.1% was driven by 6.1 percentage point impact of our divestitures. Our International zone grew 4.9% versus third quarter 2021, and that includes negative impact from divestures.\nOur organic net sales growth of 11.6% came from all of our growth pillars. Our GROW consumer platforms in North America retail, Foodservice across North America and in our International zone and Emerging Markets. As you can see, elasticity remains relatively low and consistent with prior periods, with volume/mix declining 3.8% on 15.4% pricing.\nWe generated approximately $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Pricing and growth efficiencies more than offset inflationary pressures in the quarter, and we continue to invest in and support the business and future growth. The impact from divestitures in the quarter was approximately $90 million. In addition, the quarter was positively impacted by onetime events worth approximately $30 million, including our payroll tax credit and insurance benefit payments. We do not expect this to repeat in the fourth quarter.\nLooking to adjusted gross profit margin. The third quarter came in at 30% compared to 32.5% in the third quarter of 2021, a 250 basis points decline. This decline is due primarily to dilutive impact of pricing to offset the dollar inflation, which was approximately 500 basis points. For every 1 percentage point of price increase, there was approximately a 33 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted gross margin. The dilutive impact of pricing on margins was greater in Q3 than in Q2. We do expect that this has peaked and margin percentages should begin to naturally recover in Q4.\nFrom a pricing perspective, 100% of the pricing contemplated in our guidance has been announced, of which 99% is on shelf. As additional pricing is needed in the future, we plan to continue to do it in a surgical way. At the same time, we are using the consumer solutions Miguel shared earlier such as smaller packages with lower price points or larger packages with greater per-unit value.\nWe have been careful to price to mitigate inflation dollars, but not in a way that has an adverse impact on the future. We also have been mindful of our pricing relative to private label, especially in categories where such gaps could have a negative effect on our business. As we have said before, our portfolio today is significantly less exposure private label share, and we manage these gaps not in total, but based on the relative sensitivities.\nIn the third quarter specifically, our price gaps remain stable or have declined in all categories except for 2. Those are Lunchables and Ketchup. And in these 2 categories, we saw share gains in the quarter. Even though we are not immune to price gap changes, the market dynamics and our competitiveness is playing out in line with our expectations. We will continue to monitor competitive dynamics and will take any actions necessary to protect our adjusted EBITDA dollars.\nAs we look at our volume performance in the third quarter, it was up slightly versus 3 years ago. Base volume or volume not sold on promotion contributed about 7%, which was offset by about 2% SKU rationalization and approximately a 4% decline in volumes sold on promotion. The growth in base volume, despite the price that has been implemented, demonstrates the equity of our brands and the results of the investments that we have been making to strengthen them.\nSKU rationalization, a successful program that we started at the end of 2019, not only helped us ease supply chain pressures as consumers demand rose, but also led to a reduction of less profitable lower velocity SKUs. When comparing promotional levels to our branded peers, we are reducing the percentage of volumes sold on promotion more, and that is coming off of a higher base in 2019. 2019 was a period where the company was running too many promotions, many of which did not generate attractive ROIs.\nWe do plan on increasing promotions in a rational and disciplined manner in pockets where it makes sense, particularly in categories where we have the supply to service our customers and where ROIs are strong. We are confident that we'll be able to maintain a lower level of promotion going forward that will benefit both us and our retail partners.\nTurning to our other key metrics. We generated $0.63 in adjusted EPS in the third quarter. These results include an approximate $0.06 negative impact versus last year from the divestiture of our nuts and natural cheese businesses in 2021, the largest driver of the $0.02 year-over-year decline. We are also seeing a $0.02 impact from the reduction of pension income driven by the higher interest rate environment, which we see as an ongoing headwind until interest rates moderate. Importantly here, our pension is overfunded and the magnitude of this over fund is being fully preserved.\nOur year-to-date free cash flow generation reflects a rebuilding of inventories that will be key as we continue to improve service levels. Free cash flow also reflects the Q2 payments of taxes in conjunction with the divestitures. These 2 items together impacted reported year-to-date free cash flow conversion by 53 percentage points. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion is more in line with historical levels at 68%.\nLooking to the rest of the year, we continue to expect organic net sales to grow high single digits. Price realizations and gross efficiencies are expected to mitigate the approximate 20% inflation we anticipate for the full year. Regarding adjusted EBITDA, we have raised the low end of the previous range. The expected range is now $5.9 billion to $6 billion from our prior expectation of $5.8 billion to $6 billion.\nThe 53rd week of the year is expected to have approximately a 1% to 1.5% impact on adjusted EBITDA, consistent with previous expectations. The impact from divestitures remain at $2 billion and $400 million on organic net sales and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. With the continuing strength of the dollar, current foreign currency headwinds are approximately 2%. This compares to previous currency headwinds of approximately 1%. Below the line, we now expect our effective tax rate for adjusted EPS to be approximately 19% to 20%. Due to uncertainty with regards to the potential impact of continued upstream supply chain challenges on service, we anticipate coming in at the lower end of this new adjusted EBITDA range.\nLooking past 2022, we believe our industry will continue to face several headwinds, including elevated input costs and ongoing supply chain challenges, currency volatility and rising interest rates that impact both below-the-line costs as well as consumer health and consumption trends. However, the strong equity of our brands, the evolution of our portfolio and the investments we have been making continue to take Kraft Heinz to a stronger position as indicated by our results.\nWe have also made significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. Having an average debt maturity of over 14 years and with ample liquidity, we have no meaningful near-term refinancing needs. This puts us in an advantageous position with the financial flexibility and remain opportunistic when it comes to debt capital management. With interest rates on our debt 100% fixed, our cost of capital is capped, and we expect to see declining total interest expenses as we continue to reduce overall debt levels.\nAnd speaking of interest rates, rising rates and equity market performance are putting pressure on noncash pension income for us and many others. But as part of our holistic liability management, our pension plans are overfunded and post-retirement benefit plans are prefunded. Such funded status is well preserved through cycles with our asset allocation methodology.\nAnd finally, with approximately 70% of our revenue generated in the United States, our exposure to a strengthening dollar is relatively smaller than many other players in this space. Despite the current environment, we are well positioned to face these challenges and continue to gradually progress towards our long-term algorithm. With that, let me hand it to Miguel for closing comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nChair & CEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Andre. We at Kraft Heinz are not alone in facing macroeconomic challenges. Our industry and the entire world are facing them as well. But our team at Kraft Heinz are responding with agility and resilience. And through it all, we are continuing to become a stronger company, one that is well positioned. I'm very proud of my team. And I know that whatever comes our way, we will meet those challenges. I'm excited about the company we are today and even more excited about where we are going.\nThank you so much for your time and interest in Kraft Heinz.",

This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at The Kraft Heinz Company. I'd like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2022 Business Update.\nDuring our review, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.\nWe will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during these remarks. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com.\nToday, our Chief Executive Officer, Miguel Patricio, will provide an update on our overall business performance; and Andre Maciel, our Global Chief Financial Officer, will provide a financial review of the second quarter and will discuss our 2022 outlook. We have also scheduled a separate live question-and-answer session with analysts. You can access our earnings release supplemental materials and audio of the question-and-answer session at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. A replay of the question-and-answer session will be available following the event through the same website.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Miguel.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nChair & CEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We delivered yet another quarter of strong results as we continue to successfully navigate a dynamic environment. It has been enabled by further advancements of our long-term strategy. We are growing and we are strengthening our competitive position in the face of these turbulent times. We are better anticipating market conditions, adapting to an environment that is constantly changing, and we have continued to demonstrate our resilience to these waves of challenges. So let's take a deeper look into our results.\nIn the second quarter, we generated double-digit organic net sales growth versus the second quarter of 2021 as a result of continued solid consumer demand for our brands. This growth was higher than expected and in the 5.2% compound annual growth rate compared to the second quarter of 2019. All 3 pillars of growth, and that is our growth platforms, Foodservice and Emerging Markets, contributed to these results. They are hitting on all cylinders.\nWe see strong consumption in North America continuing with lower elasticity and improving market share trends, and we have delivered accelerated growth in Emerging Markets and food service. In developed markets, particularly in Europe, we delivered solid top line results, even though this region has been more affected by higher inflation and constrained resource availability.\nLooking to our adjusted EBITDA results. We generated $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022, slightly above our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, the compounded annual growth rate was a positive 1.9% on our ongoing business. Importantly, we are offsetting record level inflation through price realization and supply chain gross efficiencies.\nIn the second quarter, our free cash flow reflects both the tax payments on our Natural Cheese divestiture as well as rebuild of inventory, which is critical to improving our service levels and fully capturing market share improvement. As I mentioned, our top line acceleration is fueled by our 3 pillars of growth: Demand across our GROW platforms, particularly Taste Elevation, remained very strong; our Foodservice business is growing faster than the industry; and Emerging Markets accelerated their pace of Organic Nets Sales growth.\nLet's take a look at each one. We have generated solid growth across the portfolio with exceptional growth in our growth platforms. They make up more than 60% of our North American business and have grown at about an 8% CAGR versus the second quarter of 2019. With the majority of the categories improving market share year-over-year, including our iconic brands, such as Heinz, Kraft Mac and Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Kraft Singles. As you can see, our consumer-centric strategy is working, and the pricing power of our brands are taking hold.\nTake a look, for example, at the relatively limited elasticity we are seeing in our North American business, where we grew organic net sales at 9.8%, with pricing contributing approximately 13 percentage points and a volume mix decline of approximately 3 percentage points in the second quarter. On a sequential basis, we saw roughly 4 percentage points of incremental pricing with only 1 percentage point of incremental impact to volume mix. This is encouraging by historical standards and reflective of a much stronger portfolio that we have today.\nConsumption in the U.S. specifically continues to increase, up to 6.9% in the second quarter compared to 2.9% in the first quarter. Earlier this year, Carlos shared our strategies to improve market share performance, and we continue to see consistent progress. Our year-over-year market share performance on a mix adjusted basis improved sequentially by approximately 10 basis points versus the first quarter of this year.\nOn a non-mix adjusted basis, our share rebound is even more pronounced with a 50 basis point improvement versus the first quarter, resulting in nearly a flat market share in the second quarter. For the onetime challenges that we addressed in the first quarter, we are seeing improvements, for example, in Cream Cheese, where our service levels have recovered and we have been gaining market share.\nFor constraints that we have been addressing through the first half of the year, such as in Lunchables, production levels are improving, and we expect these improvements to flow through into the third quarter. And for the longer-term solutions, we have been making progress as well. With the contract signed with Simplot, which will not only boost production capacity, but will give us additional capabilities as we strengthen our Ore-Ida business. The result of the great work supply chain team has done as well as what we are doing to more strongly connect with consumers, we expect to see market share results continue to rebound in the second half of the year.\nLet's now move to our second pillar of growth, which is Foodservice. In North America and international, Foodservice is growing at more than 20% clip and continues to gain share. Today, this channel is approximately 13% of our overall sales, and we are continuing to invest aggressively in both sales and capacity to capture further whitespace.\nAs I have said before, Foodservice is a strategic channel for us. First, it provides a platform for us to test innovation, quickly making adjustments and prepare for retail launch, as I described with Heinz Dip & Crunch last quarter. And second, it's a powerful vehicle to drive consumer trial for our brands particularly in Emerging Markets where consumers may not be as familiar with them.\nMuch of our current growth is coming from strong partnerships with QSRs, many of which have global footprints that align well with our whitespace opportunities. And during these times of inflation, we expect strong performance from QSRs with their relatively lower price points.\nWe are also leveraging our Chef program to not only expand our sales with existing customers, but also to acquire new customers. Overall, we continue to expect Foodservice to be a strong growth engine for our company.\nTurning to our third pillar of growth, Emerging Markets. We have been expanding our presence through a sustainable and repeatable go-to-market model, which is delivering accelerated growth. As you can see, organic net sales for our international zone grew 11% in the quarter. Within the international zone, Emerging Markets grew at a faster pace, 16%. And for those countries where we have already activated our go-to-market model, organic net sales grew 29% over the same period, with this growth driven by a 12% increase in retail distribution points. And compared to 2019, organic net sales grew 74%, with growth driven by a 77% increase in retail distribution points.\nWith the opportunity we have on this front, we are investing aggressively to expand our Go-To-Market strategy. Those countries in which we have activated the Go-To-Market strategy, represent about 35% of our Emerging Market business today, and we plan to increase this to about 75% by the year-end.\nLet's now take a closer look at how we are navigating today's headwinds. Without a doubt, it's a tough environment out there. Inflation is still high, but we are seeing some costs beginning to recede from peak levels, and others showing signs of leveling us. Service is still challenging, but we've made significant improvements. And while the Great Resignation persists, we have strong employee engagement.\nIn this difficult environment, we understand that operational excellence and delivering relevant solutions for consumers is critical. Our teams have demonstrated an ability to anticipate and adapt across our supply chain and to work alongside our retailers in developing impactful consumer solutions.\nOn the supply chain front, our evolving supply chain, powered by AGLIE@SCALE, allows us to adapt to constantly changing conditions and better prepare us for what is to come. We have increased production, improved service levels and are continuing to unlock gross efficiencies. We are on track to deliver on our efficiency plan as we work to free up at least $2 billion in variable costs by 2024.\nImportantly, we are doing both improving service and unlocking efficiencies. We are not neglecting one or the other, and we are accomplishing all of this while improve safety, while we reduce water consumption, energy consumption and waste.\nOn the consumer front, we are mindful of the current inflationary environment and how it affects consumers. Our portfolio is balanced with our market share by consumer base, but over indexed to any one income levels. Plus, we have lower private label exposure relative to the industry and to our historical levels.\nWe are tailoring our approach to consumers similar robust assortment and effective promotions, comprehensive omni-channel communication, optimization of channel mix and product innovation and renovation. The breadth of our portfolio provides us the ability to offer bundled affordable solutions. We also have the scale and insight to redeploy our programming resources in a strategic manner to provide solutions for both retailers and consumers.\nIn other words, we can focus on traffic-building products by shifting investment resources across our portfolio without needing to increase the overall spend. Such investments with retailers provide consumers solutions while driving the power of our brands and sustaining the consumption levels we have built.\nLet me provide you some examples where we are working with retailers to offer meal solutions. Take a look at our Art of The Burger campaign where retailers can pair their private label hamburger buns and patties with our condiments and cheese slices. Another great example is that $1 grilled cheese sandwich night, where we combine our Kraft Singles with private label bread and private label butter. These are examples of wins for our consumers with great value, wins for the retailer to drive traffic and wins for Kraft Heinz.\nAs our relationships strengthened with customers and we continue to improving inventory and service levels, we have more optionality to execute more mutually strategic programs like this with retailers. In the second half of 2022, we will increase the level of these programs, particularly around key occasions, but not to the extent seen in 2019.\nConsumers continue to shop online, and we continue to deliver solid results. We are growing this channel with e-commerce retail sales increasing 18% versus the second quarter of last year, and our messaging is resonating with consumers across our various paths of engagement.\nWe are working effectively across all channels to provide solutions that consumers need. For example, for those looking for lower absolute price points, we have developed smaller packs to fit their budget by our $1 vegetables or if they are looking for maximum value, we have multi-pack offering such as our Kraft Mac and Cheese 10-pack solution. We are anticipating and effectively navigating channel mix shifts in the comprehensive manner to make sure that the right product is at the right channel and at the right time.\nWe are also continually looking at our portfolio to optimize our offerings, removing elements that consumers don't want or don't really care about while at the same time, reducing costs where possible to mitigate passing on inflation through price. A great example of this is our Capri Sun renovation, which is launching now. We have reduced sugar by 40% and are using monk fruit concentrate to provide sweetness. This is great for consumers, especially parents who are looking to reduce sugar intake for their kids while maintaining the great taste that the kids love. And it also reduces our exposure to volatile commodity markets.\nWe view it as our responsibility to help consumers in this environment and by leveraging our agility and scale that we are doing just that. We are also keeping our eye on the long term and making strides in our transformation. Over the past 2 years, we have been building a culture of creativity with agile execution. We have built a team with top-notch talent, and we are investing in systemic solutions and key partnerships.\nToday, our teams can faster access more robust insights through our partnership with Google and with our Kraft-O-Matic insights generator. Kraft-O-Matic is our in-house proprietary software and data science model that analyzes consumer behavior across all our brands utilizing integrated point of sale panel and marketing data. While our internal agency, The Kitchen, generates individualized content at scale. This Artificial Intelligence-Powered tool enables us to create more than 500 customizations for a single marketing asset.\nTo date, we are onboarding internal media buying capabilities and are on track to be executing more than 30% of our e-commerce search and display activity through Kraft-O-Matic. With The Kitchen, we are now internally driving the social activity of 6 key brands in our portfolio, including Heinz, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer and Philadelphia, our biggest opportunities.\nOur ability to connect with consumers is critical to drive our strategy forward. And while there is more work to be done in this area, we are on the right track. Using our scale, we can accelerate our growth and capture more white spaces.\nLet me give you an example. In '19, we acquired Primal Kitchen. Since then, we have more than doubled the size of this business. We have similar opportunities through our acquisitions of Hamburg in Brazil and Assan Foods in Turkey. Hemmer has a very strong footprint in the south of Brazil, while Kraft Heinz has a broader network with strong distribution in other areas of the country.\nAs we bring the Hemmer brand on the Heinz network, we expect to see significant expansion opportunities. And with Assan, we are already doing the same thing in a different way, leveraging Assan's strong distribution network towards the Heinz brand in Turkey. In fact, compared to the second quarter of last year, we have sold 59% more volume for the Heinz brand in Turkey.\nBut dealmaking is no replacement for organic growth. Where we have acted, we have done so in a selective price disciplined way that has enhanced our organic growth potential. New partnerships are also a key for us. In our ongoing business transformation, we have a unique opportunity with our joint venture with NotCo, and I'm very excited about this opportunity for innovation and growth. Our management team is in place, moving with agility and already actively collaborating with the broader Kraft Heinz team in a completely new way.\nWith that all, I will now turn it to Andre to provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nAndre Maciel\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Miguel. I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we balance our top line growth while protecting margin dollars. We generated organic net sales growth of 10.1% this quarter with the increase coming from all of our growth drivers, our GROW consumer platforms, Foodservice and Emerging Markets.\nAs you can see, elasticity remains relatively low, with volume mix declining 2.3% on a 12.4% pricing, reflecting the ongoing demand for our brands. On a sequential basis versus the first quarter, we saw price realization up over 3 percentage points from 9% to 12.4%. While volume mix was relatively flat, down 2.2% in the first quarter and 2.3% in the second quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA came in at $1.5 billion, slightly above our expectations. Pricing and gross efficiencies offset inflationary pressures in the quarter, and we continue to invest in and support the business and future growth. The impact from divestitures was approximately $105 million.\nLooking to gross margin. The second quarter of this year was 30.3% compared to 34.6% in the second quarter of 2021 or a 430 basis points decline. This decline is due primarily to the diluted impact of pricing to offset the dollar inflation, which was approximately 450 basis points.\nWe generated $0.70 in adjusted EPS, also above our expectation. Second quarter results include approximately a $0.07 negative impact versus last year from the divestiture of our Nuts and Natural Cheese businesses, the largest driver of the $0.08 year-over-year decline.\nFinally, our free cash flow generation in the second quarter reflects a rebuilding of inventories that will be key to sustaining improved service levels and market share gains. Free cash flow also reflects payments of taxes in conjunction with the divestitures.\nAs we have mentioned before, we are pricing to protect adjusted EBITDA dollars. By the end of the second quarter, 99% of our intended 2022 pricing actions have been announced, with the vast majority already in the market. Much of this benefit was seen in the 12% price realization in the second quarter with additional benefit from these pricing actions expected to come in the third quarter.\nIf it turns out that additional pricing is needed in the back half of the year, we will do it in a surgical way. At the same time, we are using solutions previously described by Miguel, including our broad assortment for value beyond price and price pack architecture to provide value to consumers. We have been careful to price in a way that doesn't disrupt our future and have been mindful of our pricing relative to private label, particularly in those categories in which such gaps could have more of an impact on our business.\nTo provide some context, and as Miguel already mentioned, our portfolio today is significantly less exposure to private label share. The current private label price gap for total Kraft Heinz remains consistent with pre-pandemic levels. We are managing these gaps, however, not in total, but based on the relative potential impact on our business. And as such, we see 3 clear classifications of price gaps versus private label. The first group consists of categories where demand has historically been less sensitive to price gaps. These are situations in which we are a meaningful share leader and price points that is strategically driven by brand equity. And while our price gaps to private label tends to be higher, they do not typically impact our competitiveness. An example here will be Kraft Mac & Cheese. This group represented nearly 60% of our business.\nThe second group consists of categories in which demand is more sensitive to price gaps, but the size of those gaps are stable or contracting compared to private label. An example here will be would be cold cuts. This group represents approximately 25% of our business.\nAnd the final group consists of categories in which demand is sensitive to price gaps and our price gaps to private label are expanding. Here, we evaluate each individual category to determine how to best protect our position. For example, within sandwich cheese, we have a robust price ladder, offering the consumer choices from Velveeta slices to more premium Kraft Singles. And thus, despite an increase in price, we have been gaining share.\nIn bacon, our price points remain high, but we are covering higher commodity costs and protecting our adjusted EBITDA dollars. With Ore-Ida, the recently announced partnership with Simplot, will allow us to increase our capacity, rebuild inventory and therefore, improve our promotional flexibility.\nWe monitor private label price gaps closely, keeping the long term at the forefront of our analysis. Even though we are not immune to price gap changes, the market dynamics and our competitiveness is playing out in line with our expectations. Having said that, I would like to reiterate that we continue to take actions to protect our EBITDA dollars from inflation using pricing, revenue management tools and supply chain efficiencies.\nTurning now to cost mitigation. We are managing our cost volatility through active portfolio management and our disciplined hedging strategy. As you can see, we started the year with commodity costs at a relatively lower percentage of total COGS as compared to COGS before the divestiture of our natural cheese and nuts businesses.\nAnd while some costs have started to recede from peak levels, like transportation, overall costs remain high. It isn't clear how fast and to what extent they will decline. As a result, we continue to execute our hedging and cost management strategy in a disciplined manner.\nLooking to the second half of 2022, approximately 70% of total COGS are hedged or locked through contracts. At the same time, our teams are unlocking efficiencies with a continuous improvement mindset using levers such as value engineering and waste reduction to lower costs. We expect to free up at least $400 million in gross efficiencies this year and are well on our way to at least $2 billion by 2024.\nFinally, in terms of our overall capital allocation policy, there are no changes in our 4 main priorities, which are to: first, reinvest in the business to drive organic growth; second, to remain committed to our dividend; third, to maintain financial flexibility and our commitment to remain investment grade; and fourth, to actively manage our portfolio in a patient and disciplined way.\nLooking to the rest of the year, we are raising our expectations for organic net sales from mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth. This is primarily based on higher pricing and favorable elasticities seen to date, particularly in the U.S. Our outlook does contemplate greater price elasticity impacting volume and mix during the balance of the year as compared to the first half of the year. Also, we expect an improving but still challenging supply chain in the back half of the year.\nIn terms of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to expect to deliver between $5.8 billion to $6 billion, including the 53rd week as we leverage pricing and gross efficiencies to mitigate the higher inflation we are now expecting. The inflation for the full year is expected to be in the high teens, consistent with what we have seen year-to-date. And we will invest in our business transformation at levels consistent with our original plans. In other words, we will support our brands and make investments for our long-term advancement and growth.\nWe are anticipating roughly a 45-55 split between the third and fourth quarters for adjusted EBITDA this year. This includes the benefit of the 53rd week and a $400 million divestiture impact versus 2021. With the recent strength of the dollar, we are now anticipating an approximate 1% foreign currency headwind in EBITDA. Below the line, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for adjusted EPS to be between 20% to 22%.\nWith that, let me hand it back to Miguel for some closing comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nChair & CEO, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, Andre. We delivered another quarter of solid results while navigating today's challenges enabled by continued advancements that we have made on our long-term strategy. I'm very proud of The Kraft Heinz team because despite all of the challenges, our employees across the organization continue to do a tremendous job.\nWe are anticipating and adapting to changing market conditions while managing inflation, pricing realization and gross efficiencies. And we are recovering market share by rebuilding inventories, relieving supply constraints, improving service levels, elevating customer relationships and creating impact for disruptive marketing, all of which have been essential cornerstones in elevating our powerful brands and transforming our business. We are better positioned than ever before to manage whatever comes our way as we work to make life delicious for our consumers around the world.\nThank you for your time and interest in Kraft Heinz.",

You may begin.\n\nChristopher M. Jakubik\n\nHead of Global IR, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2022 business update.\nDuring our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and they are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com.\nBefore we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening comments.\n\nMiguel Patricio\n\nCEO & Director, The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nWell, thank you, Chris. I would just like to start by sharing how proud I am of our people. And the truly transformational work they continue to deliver for our company. We've seen 2 years of a lot of disruption, and they continue to successfully address the short-term challenges, at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage of our company and our brands.\nOur teams delivered a strong start for the year, both on top line and bottom line. We remain on strategy with the strongest growth coming from our priority platforms, brands, channels and markets. We are effectively managing our inflation, improving our supply constraints, while continuing to gain incremental efficiencies.\nWe continue to make progress, building and deploying initiatives to accelerate our advantages in areas like becoming more agile, becoming much more creative in marketing, the (inaudible) joint business plans between retail and foodservice and capacity unlocks in our growth and energize platforms.\nAs you are now seeing, we are doing this through strategic partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators to accelerate our transformation and redefine best-in-class across our value chain. It is a very exciting time for Kraft Heinz and I don't think we could be better equipped to build on our momentum through what promises to remain a very challenging environment.\nWith that, well, let's take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on the call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul De Cock, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's third quarter performance and provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Our third quarter net sales of $2.8 billion were in line with our expectations, slightly ahead of prior year as reported and flat on a constant basis. Though economic conditions across our regions weakened more than anticipated compared to the prior quarter, we believe we outperformed in most of our markets. Our sales and product mix continue to benefit from the success of our premium residential and commercial offering and collections introduced during the past 2 years.\nOur adjusted earnings per share of $2.67 reflected benefits from ongoing productivity and restructuring initiatives as well as the impact of favorable currency exchange and lower interest expense, offset by higher input costs and temporary plant shutdown. Across our markets, material and energy expenses are now improving from peak levels, though higher costs from early in the year will still impact our fourth quarter earnings as expected.\nWith our markets remaining challenged, we're executing targeted actions across the organization to drive performance such as operational enhancements, administrative process improvements and technology advancements. We are lowering our cost structure without impacting our long-term growth potential when the market recovers. We've identified additional restructuring opportunities to rationalize less efficient assets and streamline logistics operations and administrative functions. These new actions will result in annualized savings of approximately $32 million at a net cash cost of approximately $20 million after asset sales. Combined with our previously announced restructuring actions, we anticipate delivering $110 million in savings this year.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to focus on our working capital management and generate approximately $310 million in free cash flow. We repurchased 315,000 shares in the quarter for approximately $40 million as part of our current stock buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we've purchased $108 million of our outstanding shares. Across our geographies, consumer uncertainty continues to limit discretionary spending on large projects, particularly if financing with debt is required. Postponement of large renovation projects and declining home sales have been the primary driver of weakness in the residential remodeling during the current cycle, while the commercial sector has remained stronger.\nAnd most of our market central banks have lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth and benefit housing turnover. The Federal Reserve's September rate cuts and potential future actions should benefit the U.S. housing market by bringing in potential buyers who have waited for better rates. As the supply of existing homes on the market rises, price increases have slowed, which should benefit future sales.\nBuilders are attempting to offset weakness in the new home sales with price cuts, rate buydowns and closing cost assistance. The Fed's actions should also stimulate future business investment in nonresidential new construction and remodeling. European consumers have accrued record levels of savings since the pandemic and are now experiencing lower inflation rates, both of which should encourage greater discretionary spending. To address the ongoing housing shortage in Europe, several governments are initiating programs to incentivize new home construction.\nOur industry is currently at various stages of passing through the impact of higher tariffs on imported products and should compensate for increased product costs over time. As previously stated, we continue to address the situation by optimizing our supply chain and implementing price adjustments on affected product categories. Ocean freight costs have been declining and are partially offsetting the tariff impact for U.S. importers. Based on the recent changes, engineered wood and laminate imports will now be subject to reciprocal tariffs like our other flooring product categories, which should benefit domestically produced products. Because the evolving tariff situation will require some time to reach equilibrium, we will continue to adjust our strategies with the changing rates and market conditions.\nWith that, Jim will review our financials for the quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just shy of $2.8 billion. That's a 1.4% increase as reported and flat on a constant basis, as our hard surface and commercial business continued to outperform the overall residential channels. In addition, FX benefited our business on a reported basis.\nAs we noted in the earnings release, Q4 has one additional shipping day. And for planning purposes, Q1 of 2026 will have 4 additional shipping days and Q4 of '26 will have 4 less. Gross profit for the quarter was 23.7% as reported and 25.3%, excluding charges, as strengthening productivity of $57 million and favorable impact of FX of $15 million were offset by higher input costs of $39 million, continued pressure on price mix of $20 million and lower volume and temporary shutdown costs of $23 million.\nSG&A expense for the quarter was 18.8% as reported and 17.9%, excluding charges. That gave us an operating income as reported of 5%.\nNonrecurring charges for the quarter were $69 million, primarily related to our ongoing restructuring initiatives. Combining the projects announced in Q3 with our previous actions, we should have savings of approximately $110 million this year. That gave us an operating income on an adjusted basis of 7.5%. That's a decrease of 130 basis points as the impact of inflation of $52 million, lower volume temporary shutdown costs of $22 million and unfavorable price mix of $20 million offset the benefit of productivity and restructuring actions of $62 million for the quarter. Interest expense was $5 million. That's a decrease versus prior year due to lower overall debt balance and the benefit of our interest income activity.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 17% versus 19.8% in the prior year, mainly due to geographic dispersion of our income. We are forecasting in Q4 and for the full year, a tax rate of approximately 18%. That resulted in earnings per share as reported of $1.75 and on an adjusted basis of $2.67.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just over $1.1 billion. That's a 4.4% improvement as reported and 1.8% on an adjusted basis due to favorable price mix in both channel and product categories, partially offset by lower unit volume. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $90 million or 8.1%, which was a decline of approximately 50 basis points, as higher input costs of $31 million and lower sales volume were partially offset by favorable price/mix of $8 million and strong year-over-year productivity gains of $24 million.\nFlooring North America had sales of $937 million. That's a 3.8% decrease as residential new construction and remodeling remain under pressure. From a product perspective, our LVT and our laminate categories continued with positive gains versus prior year. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $68 million or 7.2%, which is 190 basis points decline versus the prior year as productivity gains of $29 million were offset by higher input costs of $22 million and the impact of lower sales and increased temporary shutdown costs of $17 million and unfavorable price/mix of $10 million.\nIn Flooring Rest of the World had sales of $716 million. That's a 4.3% increase as reported and an increase of 0.9% on an adjusted basis. The volume growth was driven by expansion in our Insulation and Panels business as well as in our laminate flooring category, partially offset by continued pressure in price and mix. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $59 million or 8.3%. It's a 220 basis point decline versus the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable price mix of $18 million, partially offset by continued productivity gains of approximately $8 million. Corporate costs for the quarter were $12 million, in line with the prior year and for the full year should be approximately $50 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $516 million, with free cash flow for the quarter of $310 million. Inventories were just shy of $2.7 billion. That's an increase of approximately $80 million, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and inflation and some increase in imported goods. Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $4.7 billion with CapEx of $76 million and D&A of $170 million in the quarter. We have lowered our full year CapEx plans to approximately $480 million with D&A of $640 million.\nOverall, the balance sheet is in a very strong position with gross debt of $1.9 billion and leverage at 1.1x positioning the company to be able to take full advantage of the changing market conditions.\nNow Paul will review our Q3 operational performance.\n\nPaul F. De Cock\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Jim. In the Global Ceramic segment, our performance benefited from our premium collections, commercial sales and expanded distribution. All of our markets faced pricing pressure due to excess industry capacity, though we were able to offset due to the strength of our product and channel mix.\nAcross our markets, our commercial business is stronger as the A&D community embraces our industry-leading product innovation and design. Tire market trends are shifting to 3D surface applications that create premium visuals and our advanced technology and design expertise position us to lead the market in this transition. We are the only manufacturer in our markets to offer coordinated collections for very small to oversized options for both floors and walls, which makes selecting our products for a project easier for consumers.\nIn the U.S., our commercial performance outpaced residential due to growth in the hospitality, health care and education sectors. We are leveraging our national distribution footprint to expand our relationships with contractors, specialty retailers and commercial specifiers. In the period, we announced price adjustments based on the current tariff rates. Due to importers building inventories earlier in the year, the tariffs have not significantly impacted the U.S. ceramic market at this point.\nOur countertop business grew in the quarter through new retail and high-end builder partnerships that will support increased production from our new [indiscernible] line that features advanced veining technology for greater realism.\nIn Europe, we improved sales volume in a difficult market. Pricing pressure persists with low market demand and our mix and productivity gains offset higher-than-anticipated input costs. Residential remodeling and new construction remain constrained, while the commercial channel shows continued strength, particularly in hospitality. Across Europe, our regional showrooms and education sessions for architects and designers are enhancing sales of premium collections and our commercial participation.\nOur porcelain panel sales continue to grow due to our advanced printing technology, yielding more authentic marble and stone looks. In Latin America, markets have softened due to persistent inflation and weakness in housing. In Mexico, we are capturing volume by introducing new textures and a wider variety of sizes and expanding our distribution. In Brazil, our volumes increased across most channels as we enhance promotional activity. In both markets, we are enhancing our product offering to improve our mix and lowering our costs with productivity and restructuring actions.\nIn our Flooring Rest of the World segment, our results benefited from strength in panels and insulation with rising volumes increasing plant utilization. Our core European markets continued to experience weak remodeling and new construction, which is constraining flooring sales. In response to these conditions, we implemented selective price increases continue to reduce our cost structure and lower input costs by optimizing our supply chain.\nIn the segment, we are rationalizing less efficient assets consolidating operations and reducing administrative and manufacturing overhead. During the quarter, sales outside Western Europe were more stable, with the U.K. performing better as the government [ increased ] investments in social housing. With the laminate category remaining under pressure, we have increased participation in the DIY channel, and we are expanding our distribution in Southern and Eastern Europe.\nPricing and mix remained difficult during the quarter, and we are executing promotional activities to optimize our sales. The European LVT market is becoming more competitive, and we are addressing this with product innovation, including new [ battling ] technology and [ park at wood ] looks. We're expanding sales of both [indiscernible], which is used in commercial applications.\nWe are also reorganizing our sales teams to maximize opportunities with residential builders. In a difficult market, our Panels division delivered sales growth in MDF boards and decorative panels, which we are expanding into new markets.\nOur installation business delivered solid results in a competitive market. We increased our customer base and volumes, which improved our utilization. To support our forthcoming insulation plant in Poland, we are growing sales in Eastern Europe, where the economy is growing faster.\nIn Australia, our expanded hard surface offering is gaining traction with our customer base, while pricing actions and productivity initiatives benefited our soft surface results. We have entered into an agreement to purchase a small New Zealand manufacturer of premium wool carpet, which we will integrate into our existing business.\nIn our Flooring North America segment, we believe Mohawk's hard surface categories outperformed the overall market due to our growing relationships with major retailers and builders, successful promotions and our innovative products with superior visuals and performance features. Our restructuring projects in the segment remain on track as we retire high-cost assets, consolidate logistics operations and reduce overhead. We delivered productivity gains that offset higher energy, material and labor costs flowing through.\nRetail volume was affected by low consumer confidence that continues to impact large purchases, though some retailers reported improvement in store traffic as the quarter progressed. Market pricing remained competitive, and in response to recent tariff changes, we announced pricing adjustments. To address pressure from input and labor costs, the industry also announced price increases in carpet collections.\nOur hard surface volume rose during the quarter as we expanded placement of our industry-leading laminate, hybrid and LVT product offering. As we expand our accessories portfolio, consumers are increasing attachment of these accessories with our hard surface collections. To grow our commercial participation, we continue to increase sales and marketing activities to expand our customer base. We are implementing promotions to grow volume in Main Street soft surface sales and we also enhanced our commercial LVT offering to align with current decorating trends.\nI will now return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. All of our markets face a shortage of avasable housing as supply has failed to keep pace with household formation. To meet growing demand, new home construction and remodeling must expand, which will also lower housing inflation pressures. Most central banks have shifted from prioritizing inflation reduction to stimulating economic growth. Declining interest rates in the U.S. and around the world should gradually encourage increased home sales and remodeling. While we believe these actions will benefit the housing market over time, we remain focused on optimizing the controllable aspects of our business including our sales strategies, product innovation and operational productivity.\nOur previously announced restructuring initiatives continue to benefit our results by streamlining our operations and reducing our cost structure. We have identified additional restructuring projects that should deliver approximately $32 million in annualized savings. We are leveraging the scope of our product portfolio, distribution advantages and industry-leading brands to expand our relationships with current and new customers. Our product mix continues to benefit from our premium collections and commercial sales, which is mitigating some of the pricing pressures in our markets.\nWe are managing the impacts of tariffs on our U.S. imported product offering through pricing actions and supply chain optimization, and we are reinforcing the value of our domestic manufacturing.\nBased on current trends in our regions, we believe that market volume should remain soft through the end of the year. Given these factors, we expect our fourth quarter EPS to be between $1.90 and $2, with 1 additional shipping day and excluding any restructuring or other onetime charges. For more than 3 years, the flooring industry has been impacted by both consumers postponing large discretionary purchases and low home sales, which have reduced new construction and remodeling activity. Housing turnover has a significant effect on our industry with U.S. consumer spending an estimated 5x as much on remodeling their flooring in the first year after buying a home than non-movers.\nDeclining interest rates, increased disposable income and higher home equity should support greater home sales and remodeling in our markets. The housing stock in our regions is aging and requires significant renovation to preserve property values. During the cycle, we have enhanced our operations, cost position and product offering to capitalize on the future market recovery. While the inflection point remains unpredictable, market fundamentals, significant pent-up demand and Mohawk's unique business strengths support long-term profitable growth.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Asia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on the call today are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul De Cock, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's second quarter performance and provide guidance for the third quarter of 2025.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers.

Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. In challenging conditions across our regions, our results reflect the impact of our ongoing operational improvements, cost containment actions and market development initiatives. Our net sales for the second quarter were $2.8 billion, essentially flat as reported and on a constant basis.\nOur premium residential and commercial products and new collections introduced during the past 24 months benefited our performance. We generated second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 with strong productivity and restructuring actions as well as favorable FX impact and lower interest expense, offset by higher input costs and plant shutdowns.\nOur restructuring actions are on schedule and delivering expected savings as we close high-cost operations, eliminate inefficient assets streamline distribution and leverage technology to improve our administrative and operational costs. Our global operations team continued to identify productivity initiatives to lower our costs through enhancements to equipment conserving energy, optimizing our supply chain and reengineering our products. Our industry faced continued pricing pressure from lower market volumes, which we mitigated through strengthening product and mix.\nDuring the quarter, we generated approximately $125 million in free cash flow, and we purchased about 393,000 shares of our stock for approximately $42 million. Our Board recently approved a new authorization to acquire $500 million of the company's outstanding stock. We have confident in our strategies to deliver long-term profitable growth as the industry recovers from this cyclical downturn.\nA dominant trend across our geographies is consumers' deferral of large discretionary purchases, which has reduced demand in our industry for almost 3 years. geopolitical events, inflation and low housing turnover are contributing to market uncertainty that is limiting residential remodeling and new construction. The commercial channel continues to outperform residential However, the Architectural Billing Index in the U.S. is forecasting slowing conditions. Available U.S. housing inventory has risen to its highest level since 2007, though elevated housing costs and high interest rates are constraining sales of both new and existing homes.\nIn this challenging market, builders are offering price reductions and buying down interest rates to encourage purchases. While housing turnover has historically driven remodeling, we believe that families remaining in their homes longer and increasing multigenerational household will require additional renovation to meet evolving family needs.\nThe Federal Reserve has postponed interest rate cuts while monitoring inflation and employment trends. Forecasters believe that Fed will cut rates twice in the second half of this year, given potential market weakness. In June, the European Central Bank cut rates to 2% to stimulate the economy and the housing market. The ECB move comes as inflation has slowed to their target lower interest rates should support increased consumer spend, discretionary spending and business investment. The European housing market varies by region, though a shortage of units and affordability are common issues.\nIn June, Germany's new government approved legislation to expand home construction by removing barriers at the Lake building projects. Since the pandemic, European households have built up record levels of savings which combined with lower interest rates should encourage housing sales.\nGiven the increase in tariffs, we're emphasizing the benefits of our locally produced collections and leading position as a North American manufacturer, we have begun to address the implemented tariffs through price adjustments and supply chain optimization. Earlier this month, the U.S. government set a new deadline of August 1 for countries to complete tariff negotiations while also announcing specific tariffs on key trading partners. We are continuing to monitor the changing tariff levels and will adjust our strategies as they evolve.\nOn July 15, we released our annual sustainability report, which is currently available on our website, embracing sustainable processes and products aligns our commitment to improve our operations and provide industry-leading features and benefits. We continue to invest in product circularity material optimization and green energy to benefit our customers, the environment and our results. This year, major media outlets have recognized Mohawk for reducing our carbon footprint, fostering innovation and developing a talented organization.\nNow Jim will review our financial details for the quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.8 billion. That was flat versus the prior year as reported and on a constant basis due to favorable product and channel mix led by our hard surface business in Flooring North America in our commercial business across the enterprise, partially offset by negative volume and continued price pressure.\nGross margin for the quarter was 25.5% as reported and excluding charges, was 26.4% and a decrease of approximately 70 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to higher input costs of $44 million, lower sales volume of $22 million and increased shutdown costs of $18 million partially offset by productivity gains of $47 million and favorable FX of $15 million.\nSG&A expense as reported was 18.8% of sales and excluding charges was 18.5%, relatively close to the prior year. It gives us an operating income as reported of 6.7%. Nonrecurring charges for the quarter were $34 million related to restructuring actions and the associated costs undertaken by all segments which, in total, will result in annual cost savings in 2025 of approximately $100 million. That gave us an operating income on an adjusted basis of $223 million or 8% of sales. That's a decrease of approximately 120 basis points as the benefit from strengthening productivity and restructuring initiatives of $57 million and FX of $9 million were offset by the increased input cost of $63 million lower sales volume impact of $21 million and higher shutdown costs of $18 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $5 million, a decrease from the prior year level due to lower overall debt balance and a benefit of interest income across the business. Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 19.3% versus 20.9% in the prior year due to geographic dispersion of our income and certain onetime benefits. We are forecasting a Q3 and full year tax rate to be approximately 19%. We that gave us an earnings per share as reported of 2.34% and on an adjusted basis of $2.77.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic has sales that just exceeded $1.1 billion. That was a 0.5% increase as reported or 1.1% on a constant basis as our product and channel mix performance offset the weakness in volume. The segment benefited from our new product introductions, leading decorating technology and the strength of our commercial business.\nOperating income on an adjusted basis was $90 million or 8.1%. That's a decrease of approximately 40 basis points on an adjusted basis as the benefit from price and mix of $27 million and strong productivity of $70 million was offset by an increase in input costs of $36 million and lower sales volume of $16 million in the quarter.\nFlooring North America had sales of $947 million. That's a 1.2% decrease due to lower volumes, mainly in our soft surfaces, partially offset by favorable product and channel mix, driven by our resilient and laminate businesses. In the U.S., residential modeling remains slow with the commercial channel still outperforming. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $69 million or 7.3% for a decrease of approximately 130 basis points versus the prior year as higher input costs of $23 million, unfavorable net impact of price and mix of approximately $9 million and increased shutdown costs of $11 million were partially offset by the benefit of strengthening productivity of $32 million.\nFlooring Rest of the World had sales of $734 million. That's a 1% increase as reported and 3% decrease on a constant basis. The decrease is primarily due to the continued pricing pressure in the residential remodeling channel as consumers defer large discretionary purchases. The ECP though, has lowered rates further, but has not yet driven increases in housing or remodeling activity. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $76 million or 10.4% of a decrease of 220 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable net price and mix of $19 million partially offset by productivity gains of approximately $8 million.\nGiven the weak residential market, we are lowering costs by removing inefficient assets and reducing operational and administrative expenses. Corporate and eliminations was $13 million for the quarter, in line with the prior year, and our full year 2025 expenses are estimated to be approximately $50 million.\nTaking a brief look at the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $547 million for the quarter, with free cash flow of $126 million in the quarter as we also repurchased shares of approximately $42 million. Inventories were just increased above $2.7 billion. That's an increase of $130 million for the quarter, primarily due to FX and an increase in imported inventory due to new tariffs.\nProperty plant and equipment with just above $4.7 billion, with Q2 CapEx of $80 million compared to a D&A of $156 million. The company has reduced its planned investments to approximately $500 million in 2025 and with D&A for the full year forecasted at approximately $610 million. 40% of the projects focused on cost reduction and product innovation and 40% on maintenance and other with the remaining 20% to complete our growth initiatives. Overall, the balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains very strong with current net debt of $1.7 billion and leverage at 1.2x.\nNow Paul will review our Q2 operational performance.\n\nPaul F. De Cock\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Jim. In our Global Ceramic segment, our results in challenging market conditions benefited from sales of our premium products strength in commercial projects, expanded distribution and operational improvements. We have pressure on pricing from excess industry capacity and pressure from imports. Our product and channel mix strengthened from our superior product portfolio and brand leadership.\nIn the quarter, we minimized the impact of inflation on input costs through select price increases and restructuring projects as well as numerous productivity initiatives, including refinements to manufacturing processes, supply chain optimization and increasing distribution efficiencies. In the U.S., our commercial performance was solid, while residential sales remain challenged from softness in remodeling and new construction.\nWe are leveraging the strength of our nationwide distribution system to target a wider range of contractors, specialty retailers and commercial projects. To counter rising input costs, we made pricing adjustments on higher-value products while increasing productivity actions. As tariffs are evolving, we are promoting our domestically produced floor and wall and our expansion of quartz countertop capacity in Tennessee will allow us to produce more of our offering in the U.S. Home remodeling in Europe remains constrained, while the commercial channel continues to perform well, led by the hospitality sector.\nIn major European cities or designer showrooms and educational events for architects and designers have increased our participation in commercial projects and boosted sales of our premium collections. Sales of our porcelain slabs with more realistic visuals or growing in both traditional channels as well as for use in countertops and furniture manufacturing.\nIn Brazil, higher interest rates have slowed the domestic market, though exports benefited sales and our mix improved. We offset higher input costs through productivity gains from operational enhancements and realigning manufacturing assets. The Mexican market remains soft, and we have implemented select price increases introduced more porcelain and innovative polished collections to enhance mix and partner with distributors to add more [ Delta-branded ]stores. restructuring initiatives in our Mexican operations are on track to improve our market position and lower our costs, with benefits anticipated in the second half of the year.\nOur Flooring Rest of the World segment managed through difficult market conditions with additional operational enhancements and cost containment actions. Residential remodeling remains soft in Europe and new construction has not kept up with population growth. A rebound in home building and renovation will be needed to meet growing demand. Pricing and mix pressure remains strong in this challenging market, and we are executing promotions to optimize our results. We took many actions to increase productivity in our operations and supply chain as well as enhance our material costs. We are removing inefficient assets, reducing operational and administrative costs and consolidating operations. We continue to invest in recycling waste and green energy to reduce costs.\nIn the flooring category, our laminate performance improved as we have progressed through the quarter. We are expanding our LVT distribution across channels with new collections and customer relationships. While our commodity panels business remains under pressure from excess capacity in the market, our mix benefited from the expansion of our high-end decorative collections and entry into new geographies. We increased our sales volume of insulation boards despite soft demand, and we are expanding distribution in Germany and Poland to prepare for a new Eastern European plant.\nIn Australia, our hard surface offering performed well, and we are expanding our LVT alternatives. Carpet sales remained under pressure, and the recent election has improved the economic outlook and orders are strengthening. We implemented price increases in June and are improving efficiencies in our operations.\nFlooring North America segment sales were about flat for the quarter, with strong performance in hard surface categories across all channels. rising housing inventory and lower mortgage rates could improve home sales and residential remodeling. While pricing pressure remains strong in the market we minimized the impact with enhanced product mix and cost reductions from stronger material yields, supply chain optimization and reduced marketing costs. we are managing inventories with reduced production and are making targeted investments to support sales and improve operations.\nOur restructuring actions have streamlined our operations by rationalizing inefficient assets closing higher cost production and simplifying our product offering. We continue to work with customers and suppliers to manage the impact of tariff costs as the situation evolves. We had strong sales growth in the quarter from our LVT, laminate and hybrid products with retailers and builders embracing our superior visuals and features. Manufacturing enhancements at our East and West Coast LVT operations have increased operational efficiencies, improving our cost position with a strong domestic portfolio to support our growing LVT sales.\nOur premium fashion and value collections led our soft surface performance as residential corporate sales remain under pressure due to reduced renovation. Our commercial capital and hard surface order backlog is strong, led by the education and hospitality sectors.\nI'll now return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. As we focus on market development, operational improvements and cost containment, we are continuing to take actions that will optimize our performance in the current market. Ongoing inflation and low consumer confidence are constraining industry sales and the timing of the inflection point remains unpredictable. To improve sales, we're leveraging the strength of our portfolio, superior service and brand value to expand our business with current and new customers. Through pricing -- the pricing pressure in our markets remains elevated we are improving our mix through our premium collections, commercial sales and recent product introductions.\nInput cost pressures will continue with the impact peaking in the third quarter as they flow through our inventory. To mitigate these higher costs, our teams will continue to execute productivity initiatives in all aspects of our operations. Our restructuring actions should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits this year while strengthening our operations for the future. Evolving U.S. trade policy should benefit Mohawk for approximately 85% of our U.S. business is produced in North America.\nWe will manage the impact of tariffs through supply chain enhancements, cost optimization and price adjustments. Our guidance does not include the potential impact from new tariffs, which have not been finalized at this time. Given these factors, we expect our third quarter EPS will be between $2.56 and $2.66 excluding any restructuring or onetime charges.\nHistorically, down cycles in our industry are followed by several years of sales growth from pent-up demand. During the past 3 years, we have made targeted investments to improve our operational performance, cost position and our product features. Through these actions, we are strategically positioned to respond to today's challenges and capitalize on opportunities as the industry recovers.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call.\nJoining me on the call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul De Cock, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nToday, we'll update you on the company's first quarter performance and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2025. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include the discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn over the call to Jeff for his opening remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim.\nIn the first quarter, our reported sales were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 5.7% as reported or about flat on a constant basis absorbing 2 fewer shipping days and year-over-year foreign exchange headwinds. Even with some market conditions, our premium collections and differentiated products we launched in 2024 generated above-market results. We recorded earnings per share of $1.52, with our performance primarily benefiting from productivity gains, restructuring actions and a lower tax rate, which offset pricing pressure and higher input costs. The impact of missed sales and extraordinary costs from our new Flooring North America order system was within the expected range and services returned to historical rates. We are enhancing the system to improve our efficiencies and provide greater functionality and capabilities.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased 225,000 shares of our stock for approximately $26 million. Last month, global tariffs were announced, which elevated uncertainty for businesses and consumers. In response to the retaliatory tariffs, the U.S. also implemented tariffs of 145% on China, which supplies a significant part of LVT sold in the U.S. Mohawk has a substantial domestic operation to produce ceramic tile, carpet, laminate, sheet vinyl, LVT and quartz countertops, which is more advantageous as tariffs increase. To offer our customers a wider variety of options, we supplement our ceramic tile and LVT manufactured in the U.S. with imported products. Most of the ceramic tile and some of the LVT we import is produced in our own facilities in Mexico and is not subject to tariffs under the USMCA agreement. We increased our inventory levels in preparation of tariffs being implemented. At the current 10% rate, we expect estimate Mohawk will incur annualized costs of approximately $50 million, which is -- we expect to address through price increases and supply chain adjustments as needed. In addition to direct to the direct impact, the tariffs are likely to influence consumer and new construction and business spending in both the U.S. and abroad, though the extent is unpredictable at this time. Another impact of the tariffs is the weakening of the U.S. dollar, which could benefit our domestic manufacturing and translated results this year. Across our markets, conditions in the first quarter weakened sequentially and with residential remodeling remaining the lowest sector. Even before the tariff announcements, consumer confidence had been falling as individuals have grown increasingly anxious about their future prospects.\nIn the U.S., concerns over inflation have prevented the Fed from reducing rates, though most are now predicting a Fed will make multiple rate cuts during 2025. So far this year, more U.S. homes are being offered for sale as available housing inventory continues to rise. After multiple years of deferring purchases, some consumers are reentering the real estate market to meet their current family needs. Others are staying in their homes longer than planned and will initiate remodeling projects to maintain their properties and accommodate family changes. As the spring selling season begins, the outlook for U.S. homebuilders remains cautious with March results showing significant variation by region. Due to economic uncertainty and the war in Ukraine, consumer confidence in Europe has also declined leading to postponed home sales and remodeling activities. As inflation near their target the European Central Bank conceptual rate to 2.25% in April to stimulate the economy as well as the housing market as defense and infrastructure spending increases, European economies, particularly Germany could see improvement.\nNow Jim will review our financial details for the quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff.\nSales for the quarter were just over $2.5 billion, it's 5.7% decrease as reported or 0.7% on a constant basis, including absorbing 2 less shipping days, unfavorable year-over-year foreign exchange and the previously disclosed on the Flooring North America system conversion. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable price/mix in the quarter, primarily in our global ceramic and Flooring North America segments.\nGross margin for the quarter was 23.1% as reported and excluding charges, was 24.1%, in line with the prior year.\nSG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 19.2% on an adjusted basis, again, relatively in line with the prior year.\nOperating income, as reported, was $96 million or 3.8%. During the quarter, we had charges of $26 million, primarily related to our previously announced restructuring actions across the enterprise, which will generate approximately $100 million of savings this year. That gave us an operating margin from an adjusted basis of 4.8%, 130 basis point decrease versus the prior year due to higher input costs of $41 million. The impact of the Flooring North America order management system conversion of approximately $30 million, which was in line with our expectations, volume of $11 million, partially offset by improvement in productivity of $51 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $6 million, a decrease versus the prior year due to lower overall debt and the benefit of interest income, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet.\nBased on our current outlook, we anticipate our interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the full year.\nOur GAAP -- our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 18% versus 21.8% in the prior year. We're forecasting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 21% and for the full year to be approximately 20%. It gave us an earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis of $1.15 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just over $990 million. It's a 4.9% decrease as reported and an increase of 1.2% on a constant basis, driven by an improvement in our product and channel mix across the segment, partially offset by lower sales volume. Our operating income on an adjusted basis was $48 million or 4.8%. That's only 20 basis points below the prior year as higher input costs of $18 million, lower sales volume of $10 million offset gains in productivity versus the prior year of $21 million, driven by an improvement in our year-over-year results in U.S., Brazil and Europe.\nIn Flooring North America, our sales were $862 million. That is a decrease of 4.2% or 1.1% on a constant basis. Segment had improvement in price and mix especially in the resilient laminate and commercial soft business units, offset by the negative impact of the order management system conversion, which was approximately $50 million, most of that being on volume. It gave us an operating income on an adjusted basis of $26 million or 3% excluding charges, a decline of 230 basis points versus the prior year as the year-over-year improvement in productivity of $27 million was offset by higher input costs of $19 million and the impact of the system conversion of approximately $30 million.\nIn Flooring Rest of the World, we had sales of $670 million, that's an 8.8% decrease as reported and 2.9% on an adjusted basis, driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable price mix, primarily in our laminate insulation and cheap vinyl business units. Operating income on an adjusted basis was 9.1%, -- that's a decline of 100 basis points versus the prior year due to unfavorable price mix of approximately $8 million and lower sales volume only partially offset by stronger productivity as the improvement in our LVT business was offset by the weakness in insulation and laminate.\nCorporate eliminations for the quarter were $12 million, in line with the prior year, and we anticipate the full year expenses to be approximately $50 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were just over $700 million. In Q1, our free cash flow was a use of approximately $85 million primarily due to timing with the delayed invoicing in Flooring North America and an increase in imported goods ahead of U.S. tariff rollout. We still forecast a strong overall year in free cash flow.\nInventories were just over $2.6 billion. Our inventory grew by approximately $80 million versus the prior year, primarily due to the increase of imported goods, again, ahead of the recently announced U.S. tariffs. Property plant and equipment were just over $4.6 billion. Our Q1 CapEx was $89 million, with D&A at approximately $150 million. The company plans to invest approximately $530 million in 2025 with D&A of approximately $600 million, focusing on cost reduction and product innovation projects.\nAnd lastly, overall, the balance sheet and cash flow outlook remained very strong with current net debt of $1.7 billion and a leverage of 1.2x.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Paul to review our Q1 operational performance.\n\nPaul F. De Cock\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Jim.\nIn our Global Ceramic segment, our strategy is to grow our market share in a difficult environment. We believe we outperformed the markets in most of our regions while optimizing our mix and reducing costs. With low demand, we are leveraging our extensive often, superior service and reliability to improve our position with existing customers while pursuing new opportunities. Pricing pressure remains a challenge due to low capacity utilization across the industry in all of our geographies, and we are taking selective pricing actions where feasible. Our restructuring projects are on schedule, and we are evaluating additional initiatives to lower our costs. In the U.S., we delivered solid results in both residential and commercial as we focused on ceramic tile contractors, kitchen and bath dealers and commercial projects. Given rising input costs, we implemented targeted pricing increases on our higher-value products. Most of our U.S. Floor and [indiscernible] portfolio is manufactured in the U.S. and Mexico, which should advantage our business given tariffs on imported products. Our domestically produced quart countertops should also benefit since more than half of that market is using imported alternatives.\nIn Europe, our results benefited from our premium collections, innovative product introductions and growing participation in the commercial channel, which is outperforming residential. Sales of our porcelain slabs are growing significantly due to our advanced visuals capacity expansion and improved costs. Natural gas prices in Europe have recently declined and will help offset other inflation. In Brazil, our results benefited from strengthened exports throughout South America pricing actions and enhanced mix. The Mexican market remains challenging, and we are expanding our porcelain offering to grow our distribution and improve our mix. Our restructuring projects in Mexico are on track and will lower our costs and increase our competitive position.\nIn our Flooring Rest of the World segment, we are responding to challenging market conditions through strategies to expand sales in parts of Europe with stronger economies, introducing new products to satisfy regional preferences and focusing on greater export opportunities around the world. To offset higher input costs, we're taking selective pricing actions where possible while also pursuing productivity gains and cost reductions. We are controlling inventory and managing operations to align with lower demand in the region.\nIn Flooring business, our transition from flexible to rigid LVT has helped increase volumes, and we have improved our manufacturing performance. In Europe, we are experiencing increased pricing and mix pressures in our flooring categories as retailers shift their product assortment to lower prices to align with consumers trading down. To increase sales of our Quickstep Premium Flooring, we are expanding distribution in Southern and Eastern Europe. In the quarter, we started a new laminate press that can deliver the next generation of product features and is more efficient than the line we retired.\nOur panels mix benefited from the growth of our premium collections and higher value decorates panels despite ongoing pressure on our commodity panels business. Our installation performance improved in the U.K. and sales of flat roof products for commercial projects increased. We're expanding insulation sales into Eastern Europe to support a new facility in Poland that will be operational in 2027 when we expect more favorable market conditions. In both the panels and insulation business, we have announced selective price increases given inflation.\nOur Flooring North America segment performed in line with expectations as our shipments recovered from the disruption caused by the order system conversion. Residential remodeling remains under pressure due to low housing turnover, elevated interest rates and weakening consumer confidence.\nIn 2025, we launched many new products to better position us for a recovery of the category. At the recent National Trade Show, our New Karastan, Black Label, luxury carpet collection, was chosen by dealers as the best product for style and design. During the quarter, we also benefited from strong sales performance in LVT as we have expanded our portfolio across all price points. Our East and West Coast LVT production strategy is improving our service and optimizing our logistics costs. The acceptance of our premium waterproof laminate as an alternative to LVT is progressing in both residential remodeling and new construction. It provides superior aesthetics and scratch resistance and the more dependable supply. We are further increasing our domestic laminate capacity to support the increasing demand. We have expanded our relationships with homebuilders across the country in both carpet and hard surfaces, which are yielding higher sales.\nIn commercial, order activity is good in all categories as we benefited from accelerated product launches. Our restructuring actions in the segment are on track and delivering the expected savings. We are working to offset higher input costs through additional process improvements and cost reduction actions.\nI will now return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul.\nWith the implementation of the tariffs last month, there is more uncertainty with the global economic outlook and softer conditions are anticipated given higher inflation, lower consumer confidence and reduced business investments. At this point, the tariff amount and the effect on consumer spending and housing are still evolving. We will take the appropriate actions to manage the impact of tariffs as needed. We're focusing on optimizing our sales and further lowering our operational costs with our restructuring initiatives this year, which should result in a benefit of approximately $100 million. Our Flooring North America segment service has returned to historical levels while we continue to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the systems new order system. We expect to increase cost from inflation will be partially mitigated through productivity gains, cost containment and strategic pricing actions. We anticipate pricing pressure will continue in all regions, given low demand in competitive markets. Global Ceramics and Flooring North America are improving their mix with increased participation in the commercial channel, sales of premium collections and performance of recent product introductions.\nIn the Rest of World segment, European consumer demand for large discretionary purchases such as flooring is at a low level with product mixing, though declining interest rates could stimulate demand. Given these factors, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS will be between $2.52 and $2.62 excluding any restructuring or other onetime charges. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the flooring category given where we are in the housing cycle. To improve our results, we continue to reduce our cost structures, simplify our operations and product complexity and invest in new product features. When the Great Recession bottomed out, our industry rebounded dramatically growing more than 10% in subsequent years. Though we cannot predict the inflection point, we expect our results to significantly improve when the industry volumes return to historical levels. As with past economic cycles, we will emerge from this period operationally stronger and ready to provide our customers with superior products and service. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryat. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on the call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, our Vice Chairman.\nToday, we'll update you on the company's fourth quarter and full year performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2025. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP numbers, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as sales actions, restructuring initiatives and productivity improvements benefited our performance. Additionally, the sales impact from U.S. hurricanes was limited to approximately $10 million.\nNet sales for the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, consistent with the prior year with 2 additional shipping days, partially offset by the strengthening U.S. dollar. While residential demand remains soft in our markets, our product introductions last year and our marketing initiatives contributed to our sales performance around the globe. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.95, in line with the prior year from productivity, additional shipping days, lower interest expense offset by unfavorable pricing, product mix and inflation.\nFor the full year, our net sales were approximately $10.8 billion, down approximately 3% as reported and on a constant basis, with an adjusted EPS of $9.70 as we progress through the year, our industry deteriorated from higher interest rates, lower housing turnover and reduced remodeling. In response to these conditions, we took additional actions to optimize sales and launch initiatives to reduce overhead, enhanced productivity and restructure operations to maximize our performance.\nLast year, 55% of our sales were in the U.S. and 45% were in other geographies with leading flooring positions on 4 continents. The fourth quarter environment was an extension of the conditions our industry faced throughout last year. Consumers continue to limit large discretionary purchases and consumer confidence remain constrained by cumulative inflation, economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.\nDuring '24, home sales across the world stay suppressed while U.S. homeowners remain locked in place with low mortgages and existing U.S. home sales fell to a 30-year low. Central banks in the U.S., Europe and other regions lowered interest rates during the latter part of last year though the impact on housing turnover was negligible in most regions. Consumers who did initiate remodeling were more affluent or completing essential projects.\nNew home construction was also constrained around the world with higher home costs and interest rates impacting starts. Many U.S. builders increased sales by buying down mortgage rates to make monthly payments more affordable. Throughout the year, investments in the commercial sector slowed, though they remain stronger than residential remodeling. These factors reduced market demand and created heightened industry competition for volume. This also resulted in greater unabsorbed overhead and shutdown costs as we manage production and inventory.\nGiven these conditions, we focused on stimulating sales with innovative new products, marketing actions and promotional programs. Our product launches delivered style and performance at affordable prices as well as unique premium products to incentivize remodeling.\nLast year, we initiated significant restructuring actions and operational improvements that are lowering our costs and will benefit our longer-term results. During 2024, we focused capital expenditures on projects driving sales, reducing costs and maintaining our assets. Through these actions, we delivered full year increase of approximately 6% in adjusted earnings per share in a soft market.\nFor the year, we generated free cash flow of $680 million and repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for $161 million. We ended the year with available liquidity of $1.6 billion and debt leverage of 1.1x. We are well positioned to manage this market cycle, pursue opportunities for long-term profitable growth and emerge stronger when the housing markets improve. We are taking actions in areas we control to optimize our current performance and improve sales and profits when volumes rebound.\nNow, Jim will review our financial details.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.6 billion. That's a 1% increase as reported and 1% decrease on a constant basis. Gross margin as reported was 23.6%. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 18.6%, giving us an operating income margin on a reported basis of 4.6%. With nonrecurring charges of $38 million during the quarter, primarily related to previously announced restructuring actions across all 3 segments, which, when completed, will yield cost savings of approximately $285 million.\nOperating income on an adjusted basis was $160 million or 6.1%, which is a decline of 60 basis points versus the prior year due to unfavorable price mix of $51 million, higher input costs of $20 million, partially offset by stronger productivity of $37 million and increased volume of $22 million, mainly due from the additional shipping days. Interest expense was $10 million for the quarter, a decrease versus prior year due to a stronger free cash flow and lower overall debt levels. Non-GAAP tax rate was 17.8% versus 21.3% in the prior year.\nLooking forward, we expect Q1 and the full year 2025 tax rate to be between 20% and 22%. That gave us an earnings per share on a reported basis of $1.48 on an adjusted basis, $1.95, in line with the prior year in a very difficult environment.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just over $1 billion. That was a 1.5% increase as reported and 1.2% on a constant basis, as the benefit of favorable mix and the additional shipping days were only partially offset by pressures on pricing and FX headwinds. Operating income on an adjusted basis was 5.3%, that's a 50 basis point increase over the prior year, with productivity gains of $17 million and increased volume of $8 million were only partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $12 million and increased shutdown costs.\nIn Flooring North America, sales were just over $930 million. That's a 2.8% increase as reported and declined 0.5% on a constant basis. as positive volume gains in our laminate, residential soft and LVT businesses were offset by continued pressure on price and mix. Operating income on an adjusted basis was 5.7%. That's a decline of 120 basis points versus the prior year as the impact of that price and mix pressure of $25 million and higher input costs of $11 million were only partially offset by improved volume of $15 million and strengthening productivity of $11 million.\nFinally, Flooring Rest of the World, sales were just shy of $700 million. That's a 2.1% decrease as reported and declined 4.8% on a constant basis as the strength of our laminate, LVT and panels businesses were offset by weakness in Insulation and cheap vinyl and continued price pressure across the segment. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 10%, declining 60 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of unfavorable price and mix of $14 million and slightly higher input costs only partially offset by improved productivity of $9 million.\nCorporate and eliminations were $16 million for the quarter as our corporate expenses were in line with our full year expectations of approximately $50 million.\nLooking at the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $667 million with free cash flow of over $230 million in the quarter and $680 million for the full year. In addition, in the quarter, we repurchased approximately $74 million of shares in the period. Inventories were just over $2.5 billion and decreased approximately $40 million, primarily due to FX as days increased to 134 days versus 130 in the prior year, primarily due to increases in sourced products, with the potential of port strikes and tariffs.\nProperty, plant and equipment were just over $4.5 billion with CapEx of $161 million in the quarter and the company plans to invest approximately $520 million in 2025, primarily focused on product innovation and cost reduction projects. The balance sheet overall remains very strong with strong free cash flow, net debt of $1.6 billion and leverage of 1.1x.\nNow Chris will review our Q4 operational performance.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment delivered solid results despite slow demand and industry competition impacting pricing across our regions. The segment's operating income benefited from improved productivity, partially offset by pricing and shutdowns. We implemented many cost containment initiatives, which included reengineering products, improving processes and rationalizing higher-cost operations.\nIn a softer market, we increased distribution by expanding our customer base across sales channels including residential builders, specifiers and specialty retailers. In the quarter, we improved our mix with products launched into 2024, higher commercial sales and expansion of premium collections. We are elevating our product offering through more advanced printing, polishing and rectifying technologies that create industry-leading visuals.\nIn the U.S., we are leveraging our ceramic service centers to grow contractor sales and increasing our position with kitchen and bath dealers nationwide. We're introducing new high-end quartz countertop collections in advance of our new U.S. production line opening later this year. In Europe, our specifier team, showrooms for the A&D community and premium products are driving commercial sales growth, and we are increasing export sales outside the region. In both Mexico and Brazil, the integration of our acquisitions has improved our product offering, sales organizations and market strategies and our Brazilian exports are strengthening as the currency weakens.\nOur Flooring Rest of World segment saw improved sales of laminate, LVT and panels versus the prior year, though insulation faced additional headwinds. Our margins were compressed due to competitive industry pricing and rising material and labor costs that were partially offset by productivity gains and lower energy expenses. Our restructuring initiatives in this segment are progressing and improving our cost position and productivity, as we rationalize less efficient assets, streamline our product portfolio and reduce administrative overhead. We also contained costs in the quarter by enhancing manufacturing and logistics efficiencies and continuing to manage inventory levels.\nIn December, the European Union introduced tariffs of more than 40% on Chinese wood flooring, which should benefit our sales of laminate, LVT and wood. We grew the sales and mix of our premium laminate and LVT collections through increased advertising that attracted consumers to our retailer. In addition, we increased product placement with our customers in Central Europe that will improve our LVT sales.\nIn our panels business, volume held up as we took more aggressive promotional actions and our more differentiated decorative panels performed better given stronger nonresidential projects. Our insulation business experienced weak demand and margin pressure from increased competition and material costs. In line with the market, we have announced price increases in installation to partially offset rising material costs. In our panels and insulation businesses, we are investing to expand our geographic footprint and are developing new products to satisfy those markets.\nIn our Flooring North America segment, we maintained sales in a declining market with benefits from our successful 2024 product launches in our fashion categories. Year-over-year, our margins were reduced by lower pricing and product mix and higher inflation, partially offset by higher volume, stronger productivity and cost reduction actions.\nDuring the quarter, we completed our LVT restructuring initiatives, which will enhance operations and provide significant savings. We focused on increasing volume across sales channels optimizing our SG&A spend and expanding both the home center and residential construction channels. In the quarter, our hard service sales grew in all channels as a result of increased distribution of our 2024 product introductions.\nSales of our recycled PBC-free resilient flooring expanded as a high-performance LVP alternative. Our residential carpet collections gained market share with the sales of our PET Premier polyester collections and fashion categories leading our performance.\nIn the commercial channel, our carpet tile products led our sales with their appealing designs and sustainable properties. Hospitality sales remained strong as new construction and renovation projects were completed.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. As a reminder, we announced Chris would be retiring from his position in February and has agreed to ensure a smooth transition in a consulting role. We appreciate Chris' many contributions to Mohawk's success over the past 2 decades.\nUnder his leadership, Mohawk Ceramic business became the largest in the world with leading positions on 3 continents. We're pleased Chris will remain on our Board of Directors and will continue to benefit from his expertise. With Chris' retirement, Paul [ DeKok ] is taking over the role of Chief Operating Officer after serving as President of our Flooring North America segment for the past 6 years. Paul will focus on enhancing our sales and operating plans across the enterprise. Paul is presently in Europe working with our Flooring Rest of World team, and he will deliver the operational reports next quarter.\nNow returning to the outlook. Our industry has been in a cyclical downturn for multiple years, and we are confident that our markets will return to historical levels, though the inflection point remains unpredictable. We expect ongoing softness in our markets during the first quarter due to elevated interest rates and weakness in housing. Intense competition for volume will continue to pressure our pricing though our mix should benefit from differentiated products launched last year, premium collections and our commercial offering. Increased material and labor costs will reduce our margins in the quarter as we can only partially pass through the higher cost to the market.\nOur businesses are finding additional ways to reduce expenses and improve processes, which will help to reduce the impact of inflation. We are restructuring our Mexican ceramic business to improve our operational performance, which will save approximately $20 million a year. Our cumulative restructuring actions will generate annualized savings of approximately $285 million when complete in 2026. Our capital expenditures this year are focused on maximizing sales, improving product mix and reducing costs.\nAs we indicated in our January 24 8-K filing, the Flooring North America segment implemented a new order management system, which had more issues than anticipated. The conversion did not impact our manufacturing or financial systems. The majority of the system processes have been corrected and our shipments are currently aligned with our order rates.\nOur invoicing was delayed and we are addressing shipping and invoicing errors with customers that mainly occurred in the beginning of the implementation. At this point, we estimate the impact on the first quarter operating income from missed sales and extraordinary costs of between $25 million and $30 million. We are working closely with our customers to remediate any issues or concerns.\nWe believe the impact of extraordinary costs will be limited to the first quarter. It is difficult to estimate the sales impact on future periods, though we do not anticipate it will have a meaningful long-term impact on our customer relationships. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, which will negatively impact our translated results this year.\nAs a reminder, our first quarter is seasonally the lowest during the year, and it will have 2 fewer days compared to last year. Given these factors, we expect our first quarter adjusted EPS will be between $1.34 and $1.44, excluding any restructuring or other onetime charges. This includes an estimated EPS impact of $0.35 per share due to the Flooring North America system issues. Historically, cyclical downturns in our industry are followed by strong rebounds as flooring demand returns to historical levels.\nAll of our regions are need increased home construction to address growing household formations and aging homes will require significant updating after several years of postponed remodeling. As the economy strengthens business investment will increase in commercial channel. As the world's largest flooring manufacturer, we're uniquely positioned due to our geographic scope, leading innovation, comprehensive portfolio and financial strengths.\nWhen the industry recovers, higher volumes will leverage our manufacturing and overhead costs to enhance our results. Additionally, our product mix will improve, pricing will strengthen and margins will expand. We are well prepared to manage through the short term and maximize our results as the category recovers.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's second quarter performance and provide guidance for the third quarter of 2024.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Our second quarter performance reflected our focus on the controllable factors of our business, including sales initiatives, cost containment and restructuring actions. Our net sales for the quarter were $2.8 billion, down 5.1% compared to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share were $3, up 9% year-over-year as a result of productivity initiatives and restructuring as well as lower energy and material costs, partially offset by market pressures on pricing and mix and foreign exchange headwinds. We generated free cash flow of approximately $142 million during the quarter for a total of $239 million year-to-date. In the quarter, we purchased 755,000 shares or 1.2% of our stock for approximately $90 million. We remain optimistic about the future of our business and confident that in time, our worldwide markets will recover.\nOur second quarter results exceeded our expectations despite soft market conditions around the globe. The commercial channel continues to outperform residential, although some softness in the category is occurring. While the long-term demand for our products is strong, residential purchases across our geographies remains weak. During the quarter, the actions we've taken to improve volumes in many product categories helped us though the gains were offset by consumers trading down and competitive pricing. Residential remodeling is under the greatest pressure as consumers defer large discretionary purchases due to inflation and uncertainties about the future.\nIn addition, flooring remodeling is significantly influenced by housing turnover rates which remains suppressed due to elevated mortgage rates, high home prices and the locked-in effect on homeowners. To reduce costs and align our business with current conditions, we're initiating additional restructuring actions across all our segments that would generate annualized savings of approximately $100 million, of which $20 million to $25 million will be recognized this year. The cash cost of these actions is about $40 million with a total cost of approximately $130 million. The execution time line will vary by project, with some extending throughout 2025 and into '26.\nIn our Global Ceramic segment, we will optimize manufacturing by idling some less productive operations and aligning production to increase efficiency. We'll consolidate regional warehouses, further reduce product complexity and leverage technology to lower administrative costs. We'll rationalize some of our Flooring North America manufacturing to enhance plant utilization, retire less efficient equipment and simplify our offering and Flooring Rest of World will lower our administrative and operating costs, streamline our product portfolio and distribution and decommission inefficient assets. These actions will complement our previous restructuring initiatives that will reduce costs by approximately $60 million in 2024. Along with these, our teams are implementing many measures to manage current conditions, including enhancing sales opportunities increasing productivity and managing our overhead and working capital.\nEconomists had anticipated that the Federal Reserve would lower rates this year to stimulate the U.S. housing sector. While central banks in some of our markets have already begun to reduce rates, the Fed has indicated it intends to wait until inflation and economic activity sufficiently slow before taking actions. After the U.S. Consumer Price Index dropped in June, many are predicting a September rate cut. If the Fed begins to lower rates at that time, we anticipate our industry should benefit next year as pent-up consumer demand increases flooring purchases.\nIn April U.S. today, once again, named Mohawk one of America's climate leaders, given our reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years. On July 16, we pushed our 15th annual sustainability report, which can be found online at mohawksustainability.com.\nNow Jim will review our financial performance for the second quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.8 billion. That's a 5.1% decline as reported or 4.5% on an adjusted basis, with global ceramic having the strongest quarter versus the prior year. All segments continue to see price and mix pressures with residential remodeling, trailing the new construction and commercial channels in the quarter.\nGross margin for the quarter was 25.8% as reported and 27.1% on an adjusted basis versus 25.9% in the prior year with lower input costs and increased productivity, offsetting the weakness in price and mix.\nSG&A expense was 18.2% as reported and 17.9% on an adjusted basis. This is in line with the prior year.\nOperating income as reported was $214 million or 7.6%. Nonrecurring charges for the quarter were $43 million, primarily due to restructuring expenses in the period. That gives us an operating income on an adjusted basis of $257 million or 9.2%, that's a 90 basis points improvement versus the prior year as our lower input cost of $83 million and productivity gains of $49 million offset the unfavorable price mix of $111 million and FX of $11 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $13 million. That's down $10 million from the prior year due to strong overall cash flow and the payoff of the term loans earlier in the year.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 20.9% versus 19.6% in the prior year. We expect Q3's rate to be between 19% and 20% and the full year rate to be between 20% and 21%, that gives us an earnings per share on a reported basis of $2.46 or on an adjusted basis of $3. That's an increase of approximately 9% versus the prior year.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just over $1.1 billion. That's a 3.4% decrease as reported and 2.9% on an adjusted basis. Our industry volume remains constrained and pricing aggressive, while we are investing in new products to try to improve our mix across our various geographies, residential new construction is outperforming remodeling and commercial, though slowing, is stronger than residential. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $95 million or 8.5%, which was in line with the prior year as lower input costs of $17.5 million, an increase in productivity of $14 million, offset the unfavorable pricing mix of $25 million, FX of $10 million and the lower overall volume.\nIn Flooring North America, sales were $959 million or a 4.3% decrease as reported, even though our laminate product continues to take share as a waterproof wood alternative and with our LVT product is expanding in the retail and builder channels. In commercial, the hospitality, government and education channels are driving the outperformance versus the residential sector. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $82 million or 8.6%. That's an increase of 260 basis points versus the prior year as lower input costs of $36 million and the strength of our productivity of $19 million offset the weakness in price and mix of $36 million.\nAnd in Flooring Rest of the World, net sales were $727 million, that is an 8.3% decrease as reported and 7% decrease on an adjusted basis as markets conditions remained slow with weak consumer discretionary spending on larger ticket home projects. Pricing mix is also continued under pressure, [ though ] sales actions taken by our team through the introduction of new products and expansion of our customer base did lead to an increase in unit volume in laminate, LVT and panels. Operating income on an adjusted basis was $91 million, that's a 12.6% operating margin. That's 40 basis points increase versus prior year, led by a reduction in input costs of $30 million, positive impact of increased productivity of $15 million offset by unfavorable price and mix of $50 million. Corporate and eliminations were $12 million during the quarter, in line with the prior year, with 2024 expected to be approximately $45 million.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were just shy of $500 million with free cash flow during the period of $142 million, bringing our year-to-date total of almost $240 million. Inventories were just shy of $2.6 billion. That's a year-over-year decrease of approximately $40 million due to reductions in costs and impact of FX as volumes slightly increase. Inventory days increased to 128 versus 120 in the prior year. The current plan, though, is to keep inventory relatively flat versus the prior year by year-end.\nProperty plant and equipment stands at just under $4.8 billion, with CapEx of $91 million in the quarter compared to D&A of $172 million. The company plans to invest approximately $480 million in the year with D&A at approximately $630 million. And the balance sheet overall and cash flow remained very strong with net debt of $1.9 billion, leverage at 1.3x and liquidity at approximately $1.3 billion, with the company purchasing approximately $90 million of shares in the quarter.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Chris to review our Q2 operational performance.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. In Global Ceramic, our markets remain highly competitive as reduced industry utilization continues to impact pricing and margins. Our mix is weaker given soft residential remodeling activity and consumers trading down to lower price points. In the quarter, the impact of labor and freight inflation was offset by decreases in material and energy costs.\nIn addition to our restructuring initiatives, we are implementing numerous cost reduction projects across the segment, including product reengineering, process improvements and streamlining administrative functions. To improve our mix, we are investing in product differentiation with leading-edge printing, polishing and rectifying technologies. These assets allow us to create floor and wall tile collections with superior visuals and higher-value sizes, styles and formats.\nOn May 10, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced the commencement of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of ceramic tile imported from India. The U.S. tile trade organization believes this could lead to tariffs between 400% and 800%. Given India's widespread dumping, Mexico has increased import duties and other markets are currently investigating similar options. In the U.S., our high-end design capabilities, domestic manufacturing and extensive distribution infrastructure are enhancing our participation in the builder and commercial sectors.\nIn Europe, our unit sales exceeded last year as we leveraged our manufacturing and styling advantages to create higher value products. Our porcelain slab expansion has enhanced our offering as demand continues to increase across the flooring furniture and countertop markets. European energy prices declined from last year, which should help increase consumer discretionary spending. Markets in Latin America remain difficult despite central banks initiating interest rate cuts.\nIn Mexico, we have announced price increases to offset inflationary pressures and import duties. In Mexico and Brazil, we are initiating additional sales and operational improvements to maximize the performance of our acquisitions. In both countries, we have restructured the organization and implemented new product and distribution strategies.\nIn our Flooring Rest of World segment, market conditions remained slow with constrained consumer discretionary spending. Declining inflation led the European Central Bank to lower key rates on June 6 and additional cuts may follow. In this challenging environment, we focused on actions to drive sales such as enhancing our product offering executing promotions and implementing strategic marketing campaigns. As a result of these sales initiatives, our volumes in laminate, LVT and panels improved from prior year low levels. Pricing and mix remained under pressure, partially offset by lower input costs.\nIn addition to our restructuring actions, we are launching many projects to improve productivity, enhance yields and lower labor costs. We are consolidating regional flooring distribution centers and reducing logistics costs to align with present conditions. We are completing the conversion of our residential LVT program from flexible to rigid products and we're improving our mix in our sheet vinyl category. Our laminate volumes grew as we expanded our customer base and enhanced sales with existing customers. The margins of our insulation and panels businesses have declined as fewer projects are being initiated and industry competition escalates.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, our results were stronger given our actions to improve price and mix through new products and retail promotions, increased manufacturing volume and associated productivity gains contributed to margin improvement in our business.\nIn Flooring North America segment, despite challenging market conditions, volumes improved year-over-year in some markets and channels, though partially offset by price and mix dynamics. Our margins benefited from productivity gains driven by operational improvements, lower input costs, logistics efficiencies and restructuring.\nThis year, we have expanded our relationships with larger U.S. homebuilders who are increasing the share of the market. Residential remains weak with home sales turnover at the lowest level since 2008 and consumers continuing to delay remodeling projects. Both of our luxury carpet collections and our value-oriented polyester products are accelerating. Sales of our LVT and laminate collections were stronger in the retailer and builder channels. Our recent laminate expansion is ramping up to satisfy higher demand for our waterproof flooring. The commercial sector continues to outperform residential with hospitality, government and education channels leading though fewer projects are being initiated.\nJeff, I'll return the call to you for closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nWe anticipate present conditions continuing in the third quarter with elevated interest rates, inflation and weak housing sales impacting our markets. In the current environment, we're executing plans to optimize our revenues and costs. We're managing the controllable aspects of our business, including innovative product introductions, reducing overhead and rationalizing less efficient assets. We're streamlining operations by reducing complexity in our processes and product portfolios. Our restructuring initiatives will deliver significant savings and enhance our performance when our markets recover. We continue to benefit from lower energy and raw material costs, partially offset by labor and freight inflation.\nIn the third quarter, we anticipate pricing pressures will continue given low industry volumes, constrained consumer spending on large purchases and consumers trading down. As usual, European summer holidays will seasonally impact our sales and performance. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.80 and $2.90, excluding restructuring or other onetime charges. While we manage the short-term environment, we're preparing to capitalize on the demand that occurs when the industry rebounds. Residential remodeling is our industry's largest category and should lead the recovery as interest rates decline and consumer confidence improves. Across our regions, new home construction is needed to satisfy demand and aging homes will require remodeling to meet homeowners' needs.\nIn addition, new commercial projects will be initiated as the economy strengthens and our product investments will enhance our participation. As the world's largest flooring manufacturer with the products, capabilities and financial strength to optimize our results as the market recovers. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to James Brunk. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's first quarter performance and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2024. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our Pro filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Though economic headwinds are impacting our industry, our results reflect positive effects of the actions we're taking to enhance our performance. Our net sales for the first quarter were $2.7 billion, down 4.5% compared to last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.86, up 6% versus 2023 as a result of restructuring productivity initiatives and benefits from lower cost of materials and energy, partially offset by weaker pricing and mix.\nCurrency exchange rates continue to affect our operating income with a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $12 million or $0.15 on EPS. Across our regions, market conditions remained similar to the prior quarter with significant pricing and mix pressure through the industry competition for volume. Though slowing the commercial channel continues to outperform residential. Residential remodeling remained soft due to low housing sales and the impact of inflation on discretionary spending.\nRetailers have reported that consumers are reluctant to initiate higher ticket projects with flooring facing greater pressure since most replacements can be readily deferred. Our teams remain focused on managing through the near-term environment. Realizing sales opportunities, reducing controllable costs and completing restructuring initiatives. We continue to manage our production levels to align inventories with market demand.\nTo stimulate sales, we're investing in new product introductions with enhanced features that convey the value of our collections. Given inflationary pressures and labor benefits and other items, we continue to take additional actions to reduce our cost structure and improve productivity. Globally, there is optimism about consumer confidence, improving interest rates declining and a rebound in the housing market.\nThe timing of this inflection in each market depends on inflation levels and actions by their central banks. Latin America aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation, and now the region is among the first to implement rate reductions. Brazil Central Bank initiated several rate cuts and Mexico recently lowered rates for the first time since 2021. In the U.S. and Europe, Central banks are maintaining interest rates as they focus on achieving their targeted inflation levels.\nThe present forecast for U.S. new home starts and existing home sales is for a slight increase in 2024 with greater improvement in the second half of the year. In some countries, governments are subsidizing housing investments by reducing mortgage rates. In the U.S., builders are stimulating purchases of their properties by buying down interest rates for consumers. The U.S. Realtors Association recently noted that life events eventually require buyers and sellers to make moves regardless of interest rates.\nThe desire for homeownership remains strong and people will find a way to realize that goal. Since our last call, Newsweek named Mohawk, one of America's greatest workplaces for women and Green Builder selected our PureTech PVC-free resilient flooring as one of their top products of the year. We're pleased to be recognized for both our commitment to our people and our product innovation.\nJim will provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Again, sales were just under $2.7 billion. That's a 4.5% decrease as reported and 5.5% on a constant basis due to year-over-year price and mix pressures continuing due to a combination of tight demand, the pass-through of lower input costs and the consumer trading down. Our Flooring Rest of the World segment was impacted the most by the price and mix issue in the quarter.\nGross margin was 24.2% as reported or 24.4% on an adjusted basis versus 24.1% in the prior year, primarily due to lower cost material and energy of $147 million substantially offsetting the negative impact of price and mix of $152 million, in addition to the benefit of our productivity and restructuring actions of $35 million. SG&A expense was 18.8% as reported an 18.4% on an adjusted basis, basically in line with the prior year.\nThat gave us an operating margin of 5.5% as reported. Nonrecurring charges were $17 million in the quarter, giving us an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%. That's a slight improvement over prior year, driven by the lower input cost of approximately $136 million and increased productivity of $47 million, offsetting the negative impact of weaker price and mix of $153 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $12 million and temporary manufacturing shutdowns of $10 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $15 million at slightly favorable versus prior year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 21.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. We expect Q2's tax rate to be between 20% and 21%, and the full year rate to be between 19% and 21%. That gave us an earnings per share as reported of $1.64 and on an adjusted basis of $1.86 an increase of 6% versus the prior year.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just over $1 billion. That's a 1.4% decrease as reported and 5% on a legacy and constant basis due to the unfavorable impact of price and product mix and lower volume as the industry demand remains compressed. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 5%. That's a decrease of approximately 130 basis points due to the unfavorable impact of price and product mix of approximately $40 million reflecting the continued difficult market conditions.\nAnd the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of approximately $11 million, partially offset by lower input costs of $32 million and productivity gains of $14 million. In Flooring North America, we had sales of $900 million. That's a 5.6% decrease as reported due to lower remodeling activity impacting volume as well as pressuring price and mix across our product lines. The business improved through the quarter, and we are introducing new residential collections with unique features to enhance our carpet, laminate and resilient sales.\nOperating margin on an adjusted basis was 5.3%. That's a significant improvement versus prior year with favorable impact of lower input costs of $57 million and productivity gains of $23 million as we benefit from our cost optimization and restructuring initiatives. This was partially offset by unfavorable impact of price and product mix of $20 million. And finally, Fly Rest of the World had sales of just over $730 million. That's a 7.4% decrease as reported or 5.9% on a constant basis due to the unfavorable impact of price and product mix, partially offset by an increase in our unit volume, even in a generally weak environment across Europe.\nOperating margin on an adjusted basis was 10.1%. That's a decrease of 250 basis points driven by the unfavorable impact of price and product mix of approximately $92 million primarily in our panels business, which has declined substantially compared to the high prior year comps when the industry was running near capacity. These were partially offset by lower input costs of $48 million stronger unit volume of $11 million and productivity gains of $10 million.\nCorporate and eliminations was $11 million for the quarter, in line with prior year and our full year forecast is for $45 million. Looking at the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were just over $650 million with free cash flow in the quarter of $97 million. Inventories were just over $2.5 billion, with the year-over-year inventory decrease of about $200 million, primarily due to a reduction in costs.\nOur inventory days were reduced to 125 days versus the year-end level of 130 Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $4.9 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $87 million, with depreciation and amortization of $154 million. The company plans to invest approximately $480 million to $500 million in 2024 with D&A for the full year forecasted to be approximately $600 million.\nOverall, the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of just over $2.6 billion and leverage at 1.4x. At this point, I will turn it over to Chris to review our Q1 operational performance.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Jim. During the quarter, sales in our Global Ceramic segment remains soft across our regions. The industry is operating below historical levels and market competition to capture volume is affecting both our pricing and margins. Product mix is also declining as higher-value residential remodeling channel is softest and those customers undertaking new projects are selecting lower-cost options.\nReduced energy prices are enhancing our results, though wages, benefits and other costs have increased. We continue to execute cost reduction initiatives, including utilization of lower-cost materials, product reformulations and reductions in SG&A spending. We're driving productivity through increased efficiencies higher yields and consolidating our distribution network.\nOur investments in new printing, polishing and rectifying technologies are delivering higher value sales and formats to improve our mix. We are introducing decorative innovations with new glazes, 3-dimensional surfaces and updated artisanal mosaics. We are launching larger formats in floor and wall tile and porcelain slabs along with smaller offerings that replicate handcrafted visuals.\nOur broad product offering, quality and service advantages are helping us expand business with both new and existing customers. In the U.S., cold weather caused the suspension of operations at a number of our manufacturing facilities and service centers in January impacting our cost and revenue. Our Tennessee quartz countertop expansion should be completed later this year, and we're developing new products and enhanced marketing tools to support our additional capacity. The U.S. ceramic tile industry has filed a petition against India in response to widespread dumping of ceramic tile in the U.S. market and expects tariffs between 400% and 800% plus additional duties for subsidies.\nOther countries where we operate are considering similar actions. In Europe, we're seeing robust growth in porcelain panel sales after our recent expansion and sales have also benefited from our new smaller and larger sized premium products. European energy prices have moved to lower levels than forecasted, which should benefit consumers. In Mexico and Brazil, we're optimizing our sales and improving our operations. We're implementing new distribution and product strategies in each country, so our brands complement each other in the marketplace.\nIn our Flooring Rest of World segment, markets remained soft despite declining inflation. In the quarter, our volumes increased from the prior year's low levels, which may be an indication of improving trends in our categories. So our results were impacted by pricing pressures as we pass through lower input costs in highly competitive markets. Our QuickStep brand sales improved during the quarter as we realign price points, reflecting lower cost and increased marketing efforts to stimulate demand. We've completed the restructuring of our residential LVT program and are beginning to see the savings we anticipated.\nThe change is delivering substantial growth in our residential rigid LVT, which is replacing our discontinued flexible products. In Insulation, we've recently experienced material increases and are raising our prices accordingly. In our panels business, margins have declined from our cyclical high comparisons due to the underutilization of industry capacity partially offset by mix improvement in our decorative collections.\nWe've announced selective price increases and panels to reflect rising material cost. We continue to implement productivity initiatives and containment and cost containment projects across the business, including labor efficiencies, higher yields and alternative materials. We're enhancing our bolt-on acquisition in MDF Boards sheet vinyl and mezzanine flooring and will complete our premium laminate expansion this year.\nIn Australia, New Zealand, reduced input costs and increased productivity offset lower pricing and volumes in a slow environment. In our Flooring North America segment, our results versus the prior year benefited from declining raw material and energy costs, partially offset by lower price and mix. While residential remodeling was generally weaker overall, market conditions vary depending on channel and product category.\nSales improved through the quarter, though many retailers in some of our facilities were temporarily closed in January due to weather. Lower market demand and consumers trading down are creating a competitive marketplace, pressuring average selling prices and product mix. Based on builder optimism, new single-family home sales should improve through the year, positively impacting our flooring business. Commercial sales continue to outperform residential led by the specified hospitality, retail and government channels.\nRetailers are embracing our new residential product launches, including Pet Premier carpet and PureTech resilient planks. We're optimizing sales of our consolidated coordinated accessories and growing our recently acquired rubber trim business. We're increasing the sales of our nonwoven acquisition with new customers and product expansions. Our West Coast LVT facility is increasing production, and our Georgia restructuring initiatives are being implemented. During the quarter, we delivered productivity gains across the segment with operational improvements, better yields and enhanced logistics. I'll return the call to Jeff for closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. The flooring industry appears to be at the bottom of this cycle, and we are managing controllable aspects of our business to improve our results. We continue to reduce our fixed and variable costs through ongoing restructuring and additional productivity initiatives. We're aligning production with market demand to control working capital, which increases our unabsorbed overhead to enhance sales and margins, we're upgrading our product offering with unique features and investing in new merchandising.\nThis year, we're completing our LVT quartz countertop and premium laminate expansion projects to support our products with the greatest growth potential when the market recovers. Our other capital investments are focused on reducing costs, delivering product innovation or maintaining the business. Due to European vacation schedules, our second quarter sales are seasonally higher than the third quarter. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.68 and $2.78, excluding any restructuring or onetime charges.\nResidential flooring sales should lead to recovery as consumer confidence improves, the housing market strengthens and postponed remodeling projects are initiated. Existing home sales will normalize and our meaningful catalyst for flooring since homeowners replace it more often before listing a property or soon after completing a purchase. Across our geographies, housing has not kept pace with household formations and substantial home construction will be required for many years to satisfy those needs.\nAdditionally, as homes age, increased remodeling investments are required to maintain property values. As the world's largest flooring manufacturer, we expect to significantly benefit from our brand leadership, investments in new capabilities and recent acquisitions as the flooring market recovers. We have the products to inspire consumers the infrastructure to deliver superior service and the balance sheet to invest in opportunities for the business. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on the call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's fourth quarter and full year performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2024.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website. I'll now turn over the call to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations with net sales for the quarter of approximately $2.6 billion, down 1.4% as reported or 4.1% on a constant and legacy basis. Lower demand in residential remodeling and new construction continued to impact our results. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.96 with benefits from cost containment, productivity and lower input costs.\nPricing and product mix declined, offset by lower raw material and energy costs during the quarter, foreign exchange had an impact of approximately $22 million on operating income or $0.27 on EPS. Turning to our full year results. Mohawk's net sales were approximately $11.1 billion, down approximately 5% as reported or 7.7% on a constant basis with adjusted EPS of $9.19.\nLast year, interest rates increased, creating challenges for our industry, which is highly sensitive to rate fluctuation. Even though we have a diversified geographic footprint, all of our markets were impacted by similar conditions. During '23, existing home sales declined substantially, remodeling projects were postponed and consumers traded down. New home construction was also constrained as rising interest rates in a weak housing market reduced home starts.\nThroughout the year, the commercial sector remains stronger than residential, though investments began to slow as interest rates increased and lending cut. These factors reduced industry demand across our business, creating unabsorbed overhead and shutdown costs. As a result, our industry reduced selling prices, and we passed through declining cost in energy and materials. Under these conditions, we focused on optimizing our revenues and lowering our costs through restructuring actions and manufacturing enhancements.\nWe aggressively managed inventory levels, which reduced our working capital by over $300 million, excluding acquisitions. We've also invested in sales resources, merchandising and new products with innovative features to inspire consumers to purchase flooring. As we integrate our recent acquisitions around the world [indiscernible] improved our operations and product offering. In 2023, we completed 2 acquisitions in Latin America that extended our position as the world's largest ceramic tile producer and solidified our leadership in the region.\nIn the year, we focused our capital expenditures on product innovation and cost reduction as well as product categories that should have the highest growth as the economy improves. In Europe, our porcelain slab and installation expansions are now fully operational. While in North America, our premium laminate LVT projects are progressing. During the second half of this year, we anticipate completing the expansion of laminate in Europe and quartz countertops in the United States.\nWe closed the year with debt leverage of 1.5x, free cash flow of $716 million and available liquidity of $1.9 billion. We are retiring a term loan of approximately $900 million in quarter 1, which has a higher interest rate. We are well positioned to manage current conditions and emerge stronger from this economic cycle when the rebound occurs.\nFinally, in January, Newsweek recognized Mohawk as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity. Our talented people are our most valuable asset, and we are proud that our teams mirror the communities in which we operate. And now Jim will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financials.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.6 billion. That's a 1.4% decrease as reported and 4.1% on a constant basis as price and mix pressures and unfavorable FX offset limited year-over-year volume improvement. Gross margin on an adjusted basis was 24.7% versus 22.4% in the prior year. The improvement is due to lower inflation, offsetting unfavorable price and mix, along with increased productivity, partially offset by the impact of FX.\nSG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 18% on an adjusted basis, which was in line with the prior year. That gives us an operating income as reported of 6.4%. On an adjusted basis, 6.7% versus 4.5% in the prior year, as lower inflation of $156 million offset unfavorable price and mix of $127 million as well as productivity gains of $57 million only were partially offset by unfavorable FX of $22 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% in the current year. We expect Q1 2024's tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%, and the full year 2024 to be between 18.5% and 20.5%. That gives us an earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter of $1.96.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just under $1 billion. That's a 0.6% increase as reported or 4.7% decrease on a constant legacy basis with all geographies seeing increased pressure in price and mix, driven by lower demand and decreases in energy costs. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 4.8% versus 7% in the prior year due to unfavorable price/mix of $41 million, only partially offset by lower energy and material costs of $29 million. Unfavorable FX of $13 million and reduced sales volume of $10 million accounted for the balance of the decrease in the year-over-year margins and were only partially offset by productivity gains of $17 million.\nFlooring North America had sales of just over $900 million. That's a 3.6% decrease as reported as demand levels and tight budgets continued to pressure pricing and mix. Our commercial category outperformed residential led by the hospitality channel. In this environment, we are focused on new innovative products, which are being well received and position us to take advantage of the pent-up demand.\nOperating margin on an adjusted basis was 6.9% and significantly ahead of the breakeven margin in the prior year, due to lower inflation of $73 million, especially in material costs, offsetting the weakness in price and mix of $37 million, also benefiting our results for gains in productivity of $29 million. And Flooring Rest of the World, sales were just over $700 million for the quarter. That's a 1.5% decrease as reported and 4% on a legacy constant basis. Stronger volume in insulation, resilient and laminate were offset by continued price and mix pressures in all product categories.\nConsumer sentiment in Europe continues to be impacted by geopolitical events, combined with higher interest rates, which is limiting remodeling activity and increasing the competitive environment. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 10.6% versus 7.7% in the prior year, due to lower inflation of $59 million, offsetting unfavorable price/mix of $49 million, productivity gains of $12 million and higher sales volume of $10 million also contributed to the year-over-year improvement in operating performance, only partially offset by unfavorable FX of $9 million.\nCorporate and eliminations for the quarter were $11 million. And in 2024, we expect them to be approximately $43 million to $48 million. Finally, turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $643 million for the quarter, with free cash flow of $56 million in Q4 and $716 million for the full year. Inventories were just shy of $2.6 billion with total inventory reduction of approximately $300 million, excluding acquisitions, with reduction of 8 days versus the prior year to 130 days.\nProperty, plant and equipment were just shy of $5 billion, with Q4 CapEx of $240 million and the full year at $613 million and D&A of $630 million. The company plans to reduce CapEx by approximately 20% to $480 million in 2024 with D&A of approximately $610 million. The balance sheet and cash flow of Mohawk remained very strong with gross debt of $2.7 billion and leverage of 1.5x, positioning the company well for the market rebound. Now Chris will review our Q4 operational performance.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. In our Global Ceramic segment, industry volume remains low, which is compressing prices and margins. All of our geographies are experiencing similar competitive conditions and the industry pass through declining energy costs. We are managing our production to align with demand and have significantly reduced inventory throughout the year. To enhance our mix, we are introducing stylized products in large and small sizes to each market.\nTo contain costs, we have increased productivity, reduced overhead and implemented alternative formulation. In the U.S., we are expanding our distribution through our local service centers and offering new collections with premium Italian styling to improve our product mix. We're expanding our quartz countertop business with innovative new introductions and increasing our participation in the retail kitchen, bath and DIY channel.\nWe've integrated Vitromex in Mexico and Elizabeth in Brazil and are enhancing our sales, marketing and operational strategy. In both countries, demand significantly declined last year due to rising interest rates and slowing economic conditions, which reduced our results. Combined with our legacy businesses, these acquisitions give us leading positions in Brazil and Mexico.\nIn Europe, gas prices have continued to decline and are improving our competitive position. We are optimizing our recent expansion of premium porcelain slabs in Italy to meet growing demand in both the residential and commercial channels. In our Flooring Rest of World business, our improved results in the quarter were driven by lower input costs and productivity gains, offsetting pricing pressure and foreign exchange.\nThe European building product category remains under stress with consumers remaining cautious and retailers reducing their inventory levels. We are investing in new products for 2024 while implementing tight cost control. We are reenergizing our flagship Quick-Step brand with interactive displays. We are completing the transition to rigid LVT, and we have decommissioned our residential flexible line. As material and energy cost decline, we reduced prices across our product categories in response to the competitive market.\nIn insulation, we have recently experienced material increases and are raising our prices accordingly. Our wood panels performance has declined during the year from cyclical high pricing to a more competitive environment with excess capacity. We continue to implement restructuring actions and enhance our smaller bolt-on acquisitions in insulation, MDF boards, sheet vinyl and mezzanine flooring.\nIn Flooring North America, fourth quarter profitability improved significantly over last year with benefits from decreased input costs, restructuring and productivity gains. Reduced market volumes led to low industry utilization rate and aggressive competition in the marketplace. We are continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to expand our distribution and improve our long-term growth.\nTo enhance our business, we are making capital investments to increase our differentiated features and lower our manufacturing costs. In each product category, we are introducing innovative new collections, which are being well accepted. We have already begun installing our new displays with retailers around the country to accelerate the sales of these product launches. We have created the next generation of LVT with our solid set premier collection, featuring new technology that enhances visuals with higher definition, color and texture.\nWe have also introduced a new flooring category called PureTech, which is PVC-free. It is an alternative to LVT made from a renewable polymer core that is waterproof and made with 70% recycled content. The commercial channel outperformed our expectations led by the hospitality sector. We are leveraging our customer relationships to expand our needle punch flooring and trim acquisitions. With that, I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. As we enter 2024, the industry is at a cyclical low, and we expect quarter 1 seasonality to be more aligned with long-term historical levels. Our businesses are minimizing their expenses, reducing the overhead and restructuring to adapt to the present conditions. We're continuing to invest in innovative products to increase our sales and mix. We are reacting to competitive pressures to optimize our volumes as we pass through the declines in our input costs.\nWe continue to manage our inventory and anticipate temporary shutdowns to align with demand. All businesses are implementing initiatives to enhance our processes to reduce the impact of inflation. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter EPS to be between $1.60 and $1.70, excluding any restructuring charges. Over the past 18 months, we have initiated many actions across the company to improve our cost structure, manage our lower volumes and integrate our recent acquisitions.\nWe've closed 4 manufacturing facilities and a number of higher cost production line, consolidated administrative functions and reduced overall headcount. When complete, these actions will collectively decrease our operating cost by approximately $150 million, with about half of this already realized. Combined with our action, improving industry conditions as we emerge from the bottom of the cycle should improve our results in the second half of the year.\nWe anticipate central banks will lower interest rates, expanding home sales, residential remodeling and commercial projects. The pace of improvement of the foreign category will be dependent on inflation rates, consumer confidence and the strength of home sales. We believe the U.S. and Latin American market should improve sooner than Europe, given the current geopolitical pressures. Historically, remodeling activity has led the flooring industry out of downturns, followed by new home construction with commercial projects taking longer given the time to plan and complete.\nAfter past housing recession, our industry has expanded with increased sales and margins for multiple years. Housing remains in short supply across all our geographies, and increased remodeling investments will be required to update the aging housing stock. Our restructuring actions, investments in new technology, targeted expansions and recent acquisitions will enable us to further expand our business.\nAs the world's largest flooring company, we believe we are uniquely positioned to improve our results as the market recovers. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Mohawk Industries Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, October 27, 2023. Thank you.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. James Brunk. Mr. Brunk, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries Quarterly Investor Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nToday, we'll update you on the company's third quarter performance and provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. In the third quarter, our net sales were $2.8 billion, down approximately 5.2% as reported or 8.1% on a constant and legacy basis in line with our expectations as our industry faced continued pressures across all regions, primarily due to constrained residential investments and tightening of consumer discretionary spending.\nOur adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.72, with our margins across the business benefiting from cost reductions, productivity initiatives and lower input costs. Our third quarter performance was seasonally impacted by vacations in Europe, which reduced our sales and earnings versus the prior quarter.\nOur lower material and energy costs offset the decline in both price and mix. We also faced FX headwinds of approximately $20 million on operating income or $0.25 on EPS.\nWe are managing our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of $385 million in the quarter and $660 million on a year-to-date basis. During the quarter, central banks around the world continue to raise interest rates to slow down their economies and reduce inflation. Their actions are affecting new construction and remodeling in both residential and commercial channels, postponing spending on new projects.\nIn the U.S., mortgage rates have climbed at the highest level in more than 2 decades, which has suppressed the housing market and limited home renovation activity. In Europe, Consumers are deferring large purchases such as flooring as a result of higher energy costs, inflation and uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine.\nOur industry faces a greater impact from these pressures than other sectors given that most flooring purchases are deferrable. With the high fixed costs required to produce flooring, competition increases as the industry slows and participants attempt to increase their sales to maximize absorption. As a result, our average selling prices and mix have declined, with the impact partially offset by lower material and energy costs, restructuring benefit and process improvements.\nThe expected housing sector recovery continues to be postponed, and we are managing the business to optimize our results and cash flow until it occurs. We're taking actions to increase our volumes while managing margins and operating expenses. We've launched differentiated collections, selectively introduced promotions and expanded our participation in the new construction channel. To further enhance our competitive position, we will shut down older ceramic production in Italy, and we are converting U.S. rigid LVT production to a direct extrusion process. These restructuring initiatives will result in a nonrecurring charge of approximately $55 million of which $50 million is noncash.\nWhen completed, these initiatives should improve our profitability by $30 million annually by enhancing our productivity, lowering our manufacturing costs and optimizing our production flexibility. Our European expansions and insulation and porcelain slabs are currently in operation.\nOur U.S. premium laminate LVT projects are continuing to start up. Expanded production in European laminate and U.S. quartz countertop should begin in the second half of '24. As the integration of our acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil proceeds, we have consolidated the general management, sales and administrative functions while enhancing the company's product offering, operational efficiencies and customer base.\nWhile the Mexican and Brazilian markets are experiencing reduced demand and margins, we anticipate gaining additional benefits from our acquisitions as these markets recover. In September, we released our 14th Annual Sustainability Report. And for the first time, we provided Scope 3 emissions. Institutional Shareholder Services has ranked Mohawk as one of the top companies for environmental quality in the durable goods and [ repairable ] category. We have significantly exceeded our 25 goals related to decarbonization, waste reduction and water conservation.\nWe're lowering our carbon footprint by using more recycled content, increasing our green energy production and expanding our product circularity. We recently received the Susan G. Komen Promise Award for our 2 decades of partnership and the fight against breast cancer.\nWe've also formalized the Board of Directors' selection policy as part of our ongoing commitment to diversity. To learn more, you can read the report online at mohawksustainability.com.\nI'll turn the call over to Jim for a review of our third quarter financial performance.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just under $2.8 billion. It's a 5.2% decrease -- as reported, 8.1% on a constant legacy basis. Higher interest rates and continued inflation has weakened new housing and remodeling activity, negatively impacting our global business with lower volume and price and mix pressures.\nGross margin for the quarter was 25% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 26.6%. That's up 100 basis points versus the prior year with lower input and energy costs exceeding unfavorable price and mix in the quarter, along with stronger productivity, only partially offset by lower volume and unfavorable FX. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A of our 10-Q, which we will file after the call.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 19.9% as reported. Excluding onetime items, it was 18.1%. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the impact of acquired businesses, investments in new products and marketing to drive increased future sales, unfavorable FX and higher inflation.\nThe operating margin, as reported, was a negative 26.5% and excluding charges, was 8.4%, As the company's current market capitalization, along with challenging economic conditions and higher discount rates resulted in a noncash goodwill and trade name impairment charge of $876 million in the quarter. Total nonrecurring charges was $967 million, primarily related to the impairment of the goodwill and trade names. But in addition, to further enhance our competitive position, we will shut down older ceramic production in Italy and converting our U.S. Rigid LVT production to a direct extrusion process.\nThese actions should improve our profitability by approximately $30 million annually. Adjusted operating income was 8.4%, as I noted. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable FX, partially offset by the reduction in input and energy costs, exceeding the impact of negative price and mix and increased productivity gains, which were under pressure due to lower plant utilization.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $20 million, the year-over-year increase is due to a significant rise in global interest. Other income, other expense was income of $8 million. Non-GAAP tax rate was 20.8% in the current year versus 17.9% in the prior year. We expect Q4 2023 tax rate to be approximately 17.5% to 18.5% that gives us an earnings per share on an adjusted basis of $2.72.\nTurning to the segments. In Global Ceramic, sales were just under $1.1 billion. That's a 0.5% decrease as reported and 6% on a legacy and constant basis. The U.S. businesses volume outperformed benefiting from our expanded position in new construction and commercial channel in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $88 million or 8% of sales, a decline versus prior year as the global slowdown in demand and pressure on price/mix led to further temporary shutdowns, lower sales volume in addition to the impact of unfavorable FX partially offset by improving productivity gains and restructuring actions.\nIn Flooring North America, our sales were just over $960 million. That's a decrease of 11.7% as reported and 12.2% on a constant basis as higher interest rates and inflation continue to pressure discretionary spending across all product channels. Adjusted operating income was $78 million or 8.1%. The operating margin was in line with prior year as lower input and energy costs offset negative price/mix, partially offset by weaker volume and lower productivity due to underutilization of our plant assets in the current demand environment.\nIn Flooring Rest of the World with sales of just over $710 million. That's a 2.6% decrease as reported and 5% on a constant basis, as our business has been impacted by low consumer confidence, higher interest rates, inflation and geopolitical events. The business in Australia and New Zealand and our resilient and insulation products held up best in this environment.\nAdjusted operating income was $77 million or 10.9%. Our adjusted operating income margin expanded versus prior year as lower input energy costs offset the weakening price mix similar to Flooring North America, in addition to the benefits of green energy and fewer temporary plant shutdowns than the prior year, all partially offset by unfavorable FX. Corporate [ eliminations ] were $10 million for the quarter, in line with the prior year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $518 million for the quarter driven by strong management of working capital, our free cash flow grew to $385 million in the third quarter and our standing at $660 million on a year-to-date basis. Receivables were just over $1.9 billion, with a DSO of 59 days, which was in line with the prior year. Inventories were just over $2.5 billion, the year-over-year inventory decreased $380 million, and excluding the impact of acquisitions, the decrease was $438 million, primarily due to a focused reduction in units supported by lower year-over-year cost.\nInventory days also decreased to 125 days from 131 in the prior year. Property, plant and equipment was just shy of $4.8 billion, with Q3 CapEx standing at $127 million with D&A of $150 million. Full year 2023 forecast includes a CapEx of just over $620 million at this point.\nAnd finally, gross debt was $2.6 billion with leverage at 1.5x adjusted EBITDA. This positions the business to take full advantage of the rebound that historically follows a downturn like we are experiencing today.\nNow with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to review our Q3 operational performance.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Jim. In Global Ceramic, our business outperformed due to our innovative product introductions and higher service levels. With this, we expanded our positions in the new home construction and commercial channels. Residential remodeling was slower due to lower home sales and postponed projects. Our investments in new decorating technology, polishing and mosaics are providing domestic alternatives to premium imported ceramic.\nWe are expanding our sales to regional builders as well as kitchen and bath retailers with our coordinated tile and countertop collections. To further expand our quartz countertop sales, we are introducing more stylized collections utilizing new technologies that provide greater value. We have lowered our distribution costs by shipping more product directly from our plants and bypassing our regional warehouses.\nIn our European ceramic business, retail traffic and new construction are being affected by economic uncertainty. In Southern Europe, where our business is concentrated, the economies are under greater pressure. Across all channels, low industry volume is creating more intense competition, and we are responding with specific price promotions by geography and channel to gain additional sales. Natural gas prices have declined by 80% from their peak, and we have reset our pricing to align with energy costs.\nWhile volumes have declined across most product types, sales of our premium porcelain slabs continue to grow, and we are optimizing our recent capacity expansion. We continue to adjust inventory and production to align with changing market conditions. To contain costs, we have increased productivity, reduced overhead and implemented alternative formulations.\nIn Latin America, we have reduced our cost structures to adapt to slower, more competitive markets, with Mexico being less affected. Our margins are being impacted by lower industry pricing, partially offset by declining energy costs. Inflation in both Mexico and Brazil is receding and central banks are beginning to lower interest rates in response with further reductions expected this year.\nWe are integrating our acquisitions in both countries and making significant progress in executing our sales, product and manufacturing synergies. To increase our distribution, we are gaining customer commitments to expand sales across all channels and price points using the combined product portfolio.\nIn each country, we are utilizing the assets of our legacy business and acquisitions to broaden our product offering. We have completed the information systems conversion in Mexico and the system consolidation in Brazil will be completed by the end of the year, enabling further operational improvements. In Flooring Rest of the World, our margins benefited from declines in energy and raw material costs, partially offset by lower price and mix. Sheet vinyl continues to outperform other categories as it provides a lower cost alternative, and we have increased production to meet higher demand.\nWith operational improvements underway, our Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition is delivering higher style products and increased sales. Our laminate and LVT sales are under pressure in the softer market and we are introducing new products, merchandising and select promotions to optimize volumes. We have executed the restructuring to support the conversion of our residential LVT offering from flexible to rigid cores, which is positively impacting our results. We are pursuing additional flooring sales, reducing cost and aligning production with demand to manage the current conditions.\nOur panels business has slowed due to a decline in remodeling activity, construction projects and industrial demand. Lower industry sales are affecting both our selling prices and volumes. Our material costs are declining, and we're also benefiting from improved productivity and green energy production. Sales of our higher-margin HPL collections are growing as our customer base expands. Our sales and operational synergies are progressing in both our Board and mezzanine acquisitions.\nOur insulation business is positioned for longer-term growth as governments require greater energy conservation for new construction and remodeling. Insulation is less impacted than our other product categories as consumers and businesses invest to minimize their energy costs. Industry pricing has declined along with input cost with regional variation caused by new plants coming online. In the third quarter, our volume improved and our margins were in line with the prior year.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the industry slowed during the quarter, and our sales in both countries were down slightly. Our results were impacted by mix pressure in the residential channels as consumers sought lower-cost flooring options to maintain their project budgets. To increase sales and protect our margins, we are introducing enhanced collections across fiber categories, elevating the market of our high-end products and implementing targeted promotions to meet evolving demand.\nCommercial sales in New Zealand remained strong, and our broad product offering is helping us secure larger specified projects.\nIn our Flooring North America segment, pricing and mix were under additional pressure as competition increased across all product categories. The impact on our results was partially offset by lower input costs, restructuring and productivity initiatives. To expand our retail presence in all flooring categories, we continue to invest in both products and merchandising systems.\nWe are increasing our participation in the new home construction channel with regional and national builders. Across the segment, we are implementing many projects to reduce cost, improve efficiencies and maximize material utilization. We are reengineering products with alternative materials and increasing recycled content. We have completed many of our restructuring initiatives to lower our costs and better align with current conditions.\nIn residential carpet to improve our mix, we are expanding our premium collections which provides superior styling and features for the more discerning consumer. For the value-conscious homeowners, we are increasing our environmentally friendly recycled polyester offering. We have completed the integration of our non-woven flooring acquisition and are expanding their customer relationships.\nIn resilient, our sheet vinyl collections continue to perform well as a preferred choice for budget-oriented consumers. As an alternative to PVC based products, we introduced a new resilient polymer core that is more environmentally friendly and scratch-resistant. In the third quarter, our imported LVT sales were disrupted by U.S. Customs actions and to satisfy customer orders, we substituted higher cost alternatives.\nWe anticipate an increase in LVT inventories in the fourth quarter to improve service. We are continuing to ramp up our West Coast LVT production and the new extrusion process in Georgia. We anticipate both projects will be substantially operational in the first quarter.\nIn addition, the proprietary technology we are implementing in these plants will enable us to introduce unique styling and features to the market. We are expanding our distribution of laminate in the retail and builder channels. Our RevWood collections are being more widely accepted as waterproof flooring alternative with superior visuals. Our new laminate product launches have been well received as consumers seek premium visuals at accessible price points.\nWe are offering selective promotions to improve volumes in a soft market. Our Trim and stair accessories business is growing as we broaden the range of our patented products across all channels. Though U.S. commercial activity slowed in the quarter as financing became more difficult, our commercial performance is holding up better than residential, led by the hospitality sector.\nOur carbon neutral product collections with industry-leading recycled content provides superior performance and design options to architects and designers. Our EcoFlex ONE carpet tile technology is gaining rapid adoption in the specifier community due to its acoustics, comfort and ease of installation. We are expanding the sales and distribution of our recent flooring accessories acquisition through our existing commercial partners.\nOur business development group has leveraged our product and service advantages to cultivate new relationships with major retail, health care, senior living and real estate development customers.\nI'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. In the present industry downturn, we are managing the controllable aspects of our business while adjusting to regional market conditions. In all of our geographies, elevated interest rates and persistent inflation are restricting consumer discretionary spending, resulting in postponed remodeling projects and new home purchases. Similar pressures are beginning to reduce commercial investments as business sentiment declines. Competition for sales to utilize plant capacity is increasing in all of our markets and lower input costs should offset the impact,\nwith enhanced products and merchandising selective promotions and expanded participation in the best-performing sales channels while maximizing our volumes while managing our margins and operating expenses. Across the enterprise, we are implementing productivity, cost reductions and restructuring initiatives to lower our expenses and improve our results.\nWe continue to manage our working capital management to optimize our cash flow. We expect foreign exchange rates to continue to be an earnings headwind. Given these factors, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be between $180 and $190 excluding any nonrecurring charges.\nWith this, our full year 2023 adjusted EPS should exceed $9. Historically, the flooring industry undergoes greater cyclical peaks and troughs than other building products due to its postponable nature. Our business fundamentals remain strong and will benefit from significant pent-up demand when the industry rebounds. Given the aging U.S. housing stock, more than 80% of homeowners who responded to recent JPMorgan survey indicated they are planning renovation projects in the near term.\nIn addition, after years of construction, trailing demand, substantial new homebuilding will be required for many years to come. Commercial activity will expand as the economic outlook improves.

My name is Alan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, the 28th of July 2023.\nI would like now to introduce Mr. James Brunk. Mr. Brunk, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's second quarter performance and provide guidance for third quarter of 2023.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that, I'll turn over the call to Jeff for his opening remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Mohawk's second quarter net sales were $2.95 billion, down approximately 6.4% as reported or 9.6% on a constant and legacy basis, primarily due to continued pressure in residential remodeling across all of our regions. Our adjusted EPS was $2.76, as our margins across the enterprise expanded sequentially due to seasonal improvements, increased production, productivity initiatives and lower input costs. We generated over $145 million of free cash flow during the quarter, further strengthening our financial position.\nTypical of housing recessions, higher interest rates and inflation are significantly impacting flooring sales around the world. To manage, we are selectively investing to increase sales and reducing expenses by enhancing productivity, consolidating distribution points and improving administrative efficiencies. In the quarter, we initiated restructuring and integration actions that will save $35 million annually at a cost of approximately $17 million. We anticipate approximately half of the estimated savings should be realized in the current year, partially offsetting the weak residential remodeling activity.\nIn addition, we're limiting future capital investments to those delivering significant sales, margin and operational improvements. In all of our regions, we're taking actions to increase sales, including promotions, retailer incentives and selective product launches. The integration of our recent acquisition is progressing, as we combine strategies and enhance our manufacturing and product offering. While managing lower market demand, we're preparing for the rebound that historically follows cyclical declines in our industry.\nOur LVT premium laminate quartz countertop, portal slab and installation, manufacturing expansion should deliver the greatest growth as the market recovers. Across our regions, we continue to see strong results in the commercial sector than in Residential. Residential remodeling remains the industry's greatest headwind due to lower home sales and deferred improvement projects. We believe channel inventories have declined and could be at a bottom.\nPrice competition is increasing with declining industry volume, mix and input costs. In the U.S., the housing markets remain under pressure due to limited supply, high interest rates and continued inflation. Existing homeowners are not moving at historical levels to maintain their low mortgage rates. In Q2, new home starts increased to 1.45 million showing the first quarterly increase since the beginning of last year. We believe the trend in housing starts will continue and will positively impact flooring shipments in the future.\nIn our regions, home sales and remodeling are also declining due to inflation and interest rates. In Europe, energy prices have continued to decline, though persistent inflation in other categories is limiting consumer remodeling. In the quarter, we benefited from lower energy prices that flow through our P&L. Our investments in biomass, solar and wind energy production reduced our operational expenses and carbon footprint positively impacting our performance.\nDuring the second quarter, the Italian government provided energy subsidies at a reduced level and the program will not be continued. In May, USA today write Mohawk is one of America's businesses that made the greatest reductions in our global emissions over the past 3 years. Mohawk was the only flooring company recognized reinforcing our position as a global leader in sustainability.\nEarlier this month, we announced that Bernard will be stepping down as President of Flooring Rest of World next year and will continue with the company in a senior advisory role to support a smooth transition. Bernard has made many important contributions to the success of the business since we acquired Yunlin in 2005. He has led the Flooring Rest of World segment for the past 14 years and delivered profitable growth by expanding our product offering, entering new geographies and bringing new product innovation to the market. I'm proud of the exceptional team that Bernard has assembled across this segment.\nWim will be joining Mohawk in October after he completes his contractual notice period. He will become President of Flooring Rest of World on February 1. Wim has more than 30 years of leadership experience with multinational packaging, building products and flooring manufacturers in Europe, Asia and Australia. He has considerable experience driving both growth organically and through acquisitions. Wim will complement our strong leadership team with a passion for innovation, strong customer focus and a commitment to sustainability.\nJim will now cover our financial performance for the second quarter.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales exceeded $2.9 billion for the quarter. That's a 6.4% decrease as reported and 9.6% on legacy and constant basis, as global inflation and higher interest rates significantly impacted the flooring industry volumes, especially in residential remodeling channel. Our global ceramic business had the strongest year-over-year sales performance in part due to a greater exposure to commercial and new home construction, which outperformed residential remodeling.\nGross margin for the quarter was 24.8% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 25.9% versus 27.7% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline is due to softening volume, temporary plant shutdowns, unfavorable price mix, higher inflation and the net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A of our 10-Q, which will be filed after this call.\nSG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 19.6% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 17.6% versus 16% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily attributable to higher inflation, the net impact of acquisitions, partially offset by productivity gains. Operating income as reported was 5.2%. Restructuring, integration and other items were $91 million for the quarter, comprised of legal settlements and reserve as disclosed in our quarterly filing, costs associated with restructuring actions announced in 2022, and acquisition and integration costs, primarily for our ceramic acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil.\nAlso in the quarter, we have taken additional actions across the enterprise to lower our costs and strengthen our results. The total cost of these actions is $17 million for an annual savings of approximately $35 million once completed. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 8.3% for the quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily driven by the lower sales volume and higher inflation along with temporary plant shutdowns and negative price mix and the unfavorable net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains.\nSequentially, though, we saw significant margin expansion as seasonal volume helped strengthen our quarterly sales and reduce our manufacturing shutdowns. And lower costs, especially in raw material and energy, combined with increased productivity, offset weakening price and mix. Interest expense for the quarter was $23 million, increasing from the prior year, mainly due to the higher interest rates.\nNon-GAAP tax rate was 19.5% versus 22% in the prior year. Our forecasted Q3 tax rate is between 18% and 19%, and the full year rate is forecasted to be 19% to 20%. Earnings per share as reported were $1.58 and excluding charges were $2.76.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic Segment had sales just shy of $1.2 billion. That was basically flat as reported and a decrease of 6.7% on a legacy and constant basis. Weaker volume and unfavorable FX were only partially offset by positive price and mix. Compared to the prior year, our business in the U.S. held up the strongest in the quarter led by its performance in commercial and new construction. Operating margin excluding charges was 8.6%. As higher interest rates and inflation are impacting the flooring industry across our regions to varying degrees, leading to lower volumes and increased plant shutdowns, partially offset by productivity gains, positive price mix and the favorable impact of FX.\nTurning to Flooring North America. Sales just exceeded $1 billion. That was an 8.9% decrease as reported and 12% on a legacy basis. Especially in the residential remodeling channel and negative impact of price mix along with the lower volume. In the quarter, the year-over-year weakening conditions were felt the most in our residential soft surface businesses. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 6% as current economic conditions with reduced inventory volumes and increased competition is driving negative price mix, lowering sales volume and creating more temporary plant shutdowns, partially offset by decreasing input costs. It should be noted that sequentially, we saw strong margin expansion in both Global Ceramic and the Flooring North American segments.\nLastly, Flooring Rest of the World is sales it's just over $790 million. That's an 11.4% decrease as reported and 10.2% on a legacy and constant days basis. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower volume, negative price mix and unfavorable FX. The weakness in residential remodeling was felt the most in our Laminate and Wood businesses. In addition, our installation and panels business was negatively impacted by the deferral of new projects. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 12.1%. As consumer spending in our category has not improved at this point and market competition increases, we are negatively impacted by the lower volume, temporary plant shutdowns and unfavorable net impact of FX, partially offset by productivity gains. Corporate and eliminations was $12 million for the quarter. And on a full year basis, corporate expenses should be approximately $45 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $571 million for the quarter, with free cash flow of $147 million in Q2 versus a use in the prior year. Free cash flow year-to-date is over $275 million. Receivables were just shy of $2.1 billion with a DSO of 58 days versus 56 in the prior year and prior quarter. Inventories for the quarter finished at just over [ $2.6 ] and excluding the impact of acquisitions, inventories decreased $277 million versus Q2 of 2022. Inventory days are at 120 days versus 116 in the prior year, but has decreased from the 128 days in the prior quarter.\nProperty, plant and equipment is just shy of $5 billion. Q2 CapEx was $117 million with D&A of $157 million. For the full year, our forecast includes CapEx of approximately $600 million with D&A of $595 million.\nFinally, gross debt finished just shy of $3.1 billion with leverage at 1.8x adjusted EBITDA. This provides us the flexibility and strength as we look to the rebound in our industry.\nNow Chris will review our Q2 operational performance.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Our Global Ceramic Segment's result improved from the first quarter with increased sales, higher production and lower energy costs. Around the globe, high interest rates and inflation using housing sales and remodeling investments to varying degrees based on local conditions. We believe that most of our customers have now aligned their inventory levels with market conditions. Our asset utilization remained low with compressed demand, and we further reduced our inventory and working capital. Our P&L benefited from lower materials and energy flowing through the inventory. This reduction was partially offset by greater market competition and lower mix, which impacted our selling prices.\nWhile energy costs around the world have substantially decreased, they continue to be highly volatile. In our acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, we are realigning the organization's defining new sales and product strategies and executing cost reductions. Our U.S. Ceramic business benefited from a greater participation in the commercial and new construction channels, enhanced styling and more consistent service. As energy and freight cost decline and industry volumes weaken, the market is becoming more competitive. We are introducing higher-style products through our mix and are focusing on stronger sales channels. We have expanded our customer base, which is helping to offset the weakness in residential remodeling.\nIn the quarter, we further reduced our inventory while maintaining high service levels. The decline in energy prices will improve our cost as it flows through our inventory. We have taken cost reduction actions in response to increased competition and other inflation. As we prepare for the start of the additional countertop capacity, we are enhancing our product portfolio and expanding our kitchen and bath channel with complementary tile and countertop selections.\nOur Ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure as residential remodeling remains slow. Our volumes in the quarter improved sequentially, and our results benefited from sales of premium residential collections, commercial products and exports. Competition is becoming more intense in all channels due to low industry volume and declining energy costs. We are adjusting to the changing environment and using promotional activities to deliver additional volume. To utilize our new portal and slab capacity, we are broadening our portfolio with innovative visuals and will manufacture products we have been outsourcing. We continue to focus on cost containment, including overhead reductions, productivity projects and alternative formulations.\nAs with our other regions, our Latin American ceramic businesses are also being pressured by higher interest rates, which have compressed residential remodeling. We are making progress integrating our existing businesses and new acquisitions, and we have begun to leverage sales of our total product portfolio to expand our distribution. The combined synergies we are realizing are partially offsetting the weakening market conditions. By the end of the year, we should complete the migration of our acquisitions onto our existing information systems, which will facilitate further sales and cost opportunities.\nOf the 2 regions, Mexico is performing better due to the economy and lower interest rates, while Brazilian ceramic industry is now being more impacted by economic conditions after holding up longer. We are taking additional sales and operational actions to manage the softening environment. The Brazilian government has recently announced that it will subsidize low interest rate mortgages to support new home construction and help the economy.\nOur Flooring Rest of World segment continues to successfully manage a difficult environment. Consumer spending has not improved as we expected. Confidence remaining low given inflation, higher interest rates in the war in Ukraine. Sequentially, our sales volume and production rates improved from the first period. With low manufacturing utilization and declining input costs, industry pricing and mix continues under pressure. During the quarter, energy and raw material costs decline, partially offsetting weakening conditions. To manage lower volumes, we're pursuing additional sales, reducing cost and aligning production with demand. The segment's third quarter is seasonally impacted by extended vacations, which will reduce our sales and earnings in the period.\nThough our flooring sales are under pressure, our sheet vinyl collections are outperforming as consumers trade down to lower price alternatives to minimize project costs. To meet rising demand across our regions, we are increasing our sheet vinyl production. The integration of our Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition has significantly progressed. We have enhanced its offering with higher performance products, sped up its operations and added another manufacturing shift to support growing volume. We are managing production of laminate and LVT to align with present demand and are introducing new products, merchandising and specific promotions to expand sales volumes. We have begun to transition our residential LVT offering from flexible rigid core and are executing the previously announced restructuring to support this conversion.\nIn our panels business, fewer projects are being initiated and industrial use has decreased due to slower market conditions. We are increasing sales of our higher-margin decorative HPL products as we expand our customer base. Our plant utilization remains low, and our selling prices are declining, partially offset by lower material costs, improved productivity and our green energy production. We have made considerable progress integrating our small board and mezzanine acquisitions, including enhancing their operations, lining sales strategies and combining administrative functions.\nLong-term prospects for our insulation business remains strong, supported by increasing energy conservation and government regulations. Presently, demand is declining as residential and commercial investments are being deferred and new industry capacity is increasing competition in some of our markets. Industry pricing is declining as input costs fall and we are reducing expenses to adjust market conditions.\nSimilar to our other regions, the Australia and New Zealand housing markets have softened due to inflation and higher interest rates. Our results for the quarter were impacted by lower volumes and mix in our residential channels, and we are introducing new products and selective promotions to increase sales volume. Our commercial sales in New Zealand were stronger, and we are leveraging our innovative collections to capture larger projects.\nOur Flooring North America segment has faced the same challenging conditions as inflation, high interest rates and more conservative lending practices have impacted the U.S. housing market and our industry. As we anticipated, the segment's margin sequentially expanded in the quarter due to seasonality and lower costs flowing through the inventory. To control costs, we have enhanced productivity, streamlined administrative functions and initiated restructuring actions. With weak residential remodeling and softer mix, retailers continue to tightly manage their inventory level, further impacting demand in the quarter.\nWith energy and raw material costs declining, market competition is increasing. New single-family home starts have begun to increase with some builders subsidizing interest rates to attract buyers. In retail, we are providing new product options to trade up consumers and value alternatives for those with budget constraints. To increase sales, we're initiating selective promotional activity, enhancing our product offering and introducing more consumer-friendly displays.\nThe U.S. commercial sector has proven more resilient as businesses continue to invest in new construction and remodeling projects. The GI Architectural Billing Index reflected a stable environment for new projects. We are experiencing some mix pressure in commercial as customers seek to maintain budgets. The hospitality and Main Street channels perform in the and we are expecting our participation in the health care channels.\nOur unique products, which are certified carbon neutral are growing as they deliver superior performance with a negative carbon footprint. Our commercial accessories acquisition is performing well as we leverage our relationships to enhance its product sales. Mohawk is the leading producer of premium laminate due to our more realistic visuals and waterproof performance. We continue to see a broader adoption of our Redwood products in both retail and builder channels. We have increased our offering of our revolutionary signature technology, which enhances the richness of our Pergo and Karastan collections. We are aligning production with current conditions, implementing cost reductions and managing pricing and mix to optimize our results.\nIn Residential carpet, we've seen a sequential improvement in sales and production, along with the decline in input costs, which improved our margins from the first quarter. We have enhanced structure Karastan and Godfrey Hirst collections and are providing retailer incentives to grow volumes. Our expanded solution dyed polyester carpet portfolio is increasing our position with multifamily developers and single home builders negatively impacting our product mix. We have integrated our recent nonwoven acquisition and are improving its sales and operations.\nWith the decline in ocean freight costs, market pressure for LVT are increasing and the U.S. force Labor Protection Act is impacting some shipments. Higher cost inventory reduced our margins as we adapted to the changing market. Our new rigid LVT introductions with updated visuals, Wet Protect and antimicrobial technologies differentiate us in the market and our sheet vinyl sales rose as consumers selected more affordable options. Our West Coast LVT plant will continue to ramp up throughout the rest of the year.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Mohawk's second quarter performance reflected the positive impact of the many initiatives we're executing across our business. We're managing the current market conditions while preparing for the rebound in demand that follows cyclical downturns. Central banks have raised interest rates to reduce inflation and are signaling additional rate hikes are possible. In the U.S., we've seen a rise in builder confidence and housing starts will increase our residential new construction business. We expect the commercial sector to outperform the residential category through this year, even with continued weakness in the office category. Though employment remains strong, remodeling and existing home sales are being delayed due to limited housing availability, higher interest rate inflation. Historically, when the economy recovers, these postponed remodeling projects fueled greater industry growth. Our new restructuring initiatives could save $35 million per year. Our recent acquisitions will add greater benefit to our results as we optimize their performance. In this competitive market, we expect continued pressure on pricing and mix, partially offset by the flow-through of lower material and energy costs.\nOur third quarter seasonally weakened through the summer holidays, lower consumer spending and lower production in Europe. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.62 and $2.72, excluding any restructuring acquisition and other charges. At Mohawk, we're taking the necessary steps to manage today's challenges while preparing for tomorrow's opportunity. When Central Bank shift their focus to a more balanced approach, our business will accelerate as the industry recovers. In all of our regions, housing is in short supply, aging homes are in need of remodeling and businesses will invest to grow in more favorable conditions. These factors will create higher growth for flooring and our investments in capacity expansion and our recent acquisitions will further enhance our results.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company first quarter performance and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2023. .\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for opening comments.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. For the first quarter of 2023, Mohawk net sales were $2.8 billion, down approximately 6.9% as reported or 5.9% on a constant basis, and our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.75. All of our businesses are adapting our strategies for a more challenging environment. We're managing our costs while investing for both short- and long-term growth. We exceeded our earnings expectations with the businesses maintaining higher pricing and mix and Flooring Rest of World outperforming the other segments.\nThe commercial channel continues to be stronger than residential with home remodeling projects being postponed and new housing construction being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we generated over $125 million of free cash flow. We strategically invested in new product innovation, enhanced participation in customer trade shows to improve sales. We are continuing to reduce costs across the enterprise by enhancing productivity, streamlining processes and controlling administrative expenses.\nOur customers remain conservative in their inventory commitments and all of our operations are running at lower utilization levels, creating higher costs from unabsorbed overhead. We see increased competition as industry capacity utilization and input costs decline. In Europe, natural gas prices have dropped dramatically, though they remain at almost double the historical levels. We expect consumer spending to improve as wages rise, inflation slows and energy costs fall.\nOur new product introductions provide more value options for budget conscious consumers. In the U.S. limited supply, high interest rates and persistent inflation have suppressed the housing market. Lower home sales and changing consumer spending habits are impacting the modeling category. We are maximizing our commercial business with new introductions, marketing initiatives and targeted promotions.\nAnd our other geographies, demand is similarly slowing with residential more affected than commercial. Though the Mexican economy faces challenges, our business there is holding up better, while Brazil slowed more with higher interest rates and reductions in consumer inventories.\nOur restructuring actions are on track in the Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of World segments and should improve the results of our business. We are limiting our other capital investments to those providing significant sales, margins and process improvements. We're expanding our constrained category that have the greatest growth potential when the economy recovers. These include LVT, premium laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation products.\nWe completed 2 acquisitions in ceramic in Brazil and Mexico that had combined sales of approximately $425 million, almost doubling our existing market share in those geographies. We are developing strategies to increase our sales by providing broader product offering and using combined brands to satisfy all price points. In each country, we're beginning to consolidate the businesses to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and optimize production. We also continue to improve the small bolt-on acquisitions in Europe and U.S. that we completed last year.\nDespite falling energy prices, natural gas and electricity inflation remained a headwind in the first quarter, though our future results will benefit as lower costs flow through the P&L. Our sustainable strategy includes investments in both production of green energy from biomass, wind and solar, which reduces both our carbon -- our expenses in our carbon footprint. Our 2 biomass energy plants lowered our cost and improved our results in the quarter. We also purchased some of our European energy at various times to reduce future cost volatility. Italian energy subsidies have been extended at reduced levels through the second quarter.\nI'll turn the call over to Jim for his review of our financial performance.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.8 billion. That's a decrease of 6.9% as reported or 5.9% on a constant basis, driven by a reduction in volume and unfavorable FX as compared to Q1 2022, which was still benefiting from the COVID pandemic rebound in residential remodeling activity. The decrease was partially offset by favorable price mix and acquisitions.\nGlobal Ceramic with a larger percentage of commercial and new construction had the strongest quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.9% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 24.1% versus 26.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the impact of inflation, lower volume, the related temporary plant shutdowns and unfavorable FX, partially offset by stronger price mix and productivity gains. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A of our 10-Q which will be filed after the call.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 18.4% as reported. The year-over-year dollar increase in SG&A was driven by inflation, primarily in employee expenses, increased costs in product development and marketing to drive future sales, volume and unfavorable price mix, partially offset by favorable FX and productivity initiatives.\nOperating margin as reported was 4.5%. Restructuring, acquisitions and other charges were $36 million in the quarter, of which $6 million was cash. These charges are primarily related to the previously announced initiatives, mainly in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the world. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 5.8% and similar to gross margin, the year-over-year decline is driven by higher inflation, lower volumes and related temporary plant shutdowns and costs associated with investments in new product development and marketing, partially offset by favorable price mix and productivity gains.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $17 million, increasing year-over-year, primarily due to the higher interest rates. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% versus 22.3% in the prior year. We expect Q2's tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20% and the full year rate to be between 21% and 22% with quarterly variations. That leads us to an earnings per share as reported of $1.26 and excluding charges of $1.75.\nTurning to the segments. In Global Ceramic, sales were just shy of $1.1 billion. That's a 0.5% decrease as reported and 1.2% decrease on a constant basis. Volume declines across all regions were only partially offset by favorable price mix, FX gains and acquisitions. Overall, the U.S. business had the strongest year-over-year performance as commercial and new home construction outperformed residential remodeling.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 6.3%, declining year-over-year due to the slowing economies and higher interest rates impacting all geographies, resulting in lower volumes and short-term plant shutdowns, partially offset by favorable price mix and productivity gains. We are focusing on expanding markets, integration of our acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil, differentiated products and growth CapEx to drive future results.\nIn Flooring North America, sales were $953 million. That's an 11.1% decrease as reported and on a constant basis. We saw weakness across all product categories compared to a very robust Q1 of 2022, led by residential soft surface products as our commercial and laminate businesses, while still down versus prior year, had the strongest year-over-year volumes in the segment.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 0.5%. The decline in operating margin was due to the weakening in the housing market with consumers deferring home improvement projects and trading down to meet constrained budgets, leading to lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns. In addition, the segment's margins were compressed as it absorbed peak material costs from prior periods. In the quarter, we also invested in new product development and marketing initiatives to expand future sales. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable price mix and productivity gains.\nAnd finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $793 million. That's a 9.7% decline as reported including unfavorable FX and 6% on a constant basis as housing-related purchases significantly declined, negatively impacting our flooring products as compared to our installation business, which maintained a positive year-over-year growth, driven by the push to further conserve energy.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 12.6%, declining versus prior year due to the higher inflation, lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns, partially offset by favorable price mix and benefit from our green energy production. We are implementing selective promotion, executing our restructuring actions and increasing supply chains outside of Europe to drive sales and margin growth.\nCorporate expense and eliminations were $10 million, in line with the prior year and I would expect full year corporate expenses should be approximately $45 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the period was $129 million versus a $75 million use of cash in the prior year. Receivables were just shy of $2.1 billion, with DSO at 56 days versus 54 in the prior year but improving from 60 days as of the end of the year of 2022. Inventories were just over $2.7 billion. Now excluding the impact of acquisitions, inventories decreased $114 million versus Q4 of 2022. Inventory days stand at 128 days versus 111 in the prior year, but improving from 138 days at the end of 2022.\nProperty, plant and equipment was just over $4.9 billion, and Q1 CapEx was $128 million, with D&A at $170 million. Full year, our '23 forecast includes CapEx of $570 million and D&A of approximately $600 million. And finally, gross debt of $3.3 billion and leverage at 1.7x adjusted EBITDA gives us the strength and flexibility to manage through this uncertain market.\nNow I will turn the call over to Chris to review our Q1 operational performance.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. The Global Ceramic segment spans many countries with each having their own unique economic conditions. All of our regions are being impacted by slowing economies and higher interest rates. The commercial channel is strongest and new home construction held up better than residential remodeling as consumers reduce discretionary purchases.\nIn this softening environment, our customers are lowering their inventory levels with significant differences in each region. As industry volumes decline, we are facing additional competitive pressures in our markets. Our pricing has lagged our cost changes, though we are seeing decreases in energy and material expenses, which should benefit our future results.\nThe U.S. is performing better than our other ceramic markets due to our greater sales in the commercial sector. Our domestic production is more reliable than imported alternatives, which is benefiting our sales, particularly in our premium collections, which compare favorably to European alternatives.\nWe are shifting our sales force focus to target opportunities in the multifamily and exterior channels and are expanding our commercial and builder distribution with curated collections for immediate delivery. To increase our countertop volume, we are expanding our business with national accounts, contractors and kitchen and bath retailers. We are reengineering our entry-level courts countertop to lower our cost and enhance the value.\nTo manage through the slowing environment, we continue to reduce our costs across the business, including overhead and discretionary spending. Our ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure as demand has declined due to ongoing inflation and higher interest rates. We maintained higher average selling prices than we anticipated, partially due to our new introductions. Our overall [Technical\nDifficulty]\n\nOperator\n\nWe have lost our speaker connection. Please stand by while we reconnect.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nDavid, have you reconnect him?\n\nOperator\n\nI have now brought Chris Wellborn back in, and the conference can continue.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nOur ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure as demand has declined due to ongoing inflation and higher interest rates. We maintained higher average selling prices than we anticipated, partially due to our new introductions. Our overall volumes were down in the quarter with all markets impacted by slowing residential remodeling.\nAs the market slows, competition is becoming more aggressive in all channels. We are increasing porcelain slab production to support continued sales growth through enhanced visuals and specialized textures. A drop in fourth quarter energy prices benefited our cost in this quarter and subsidies from the Italian government helped to offset the impact of energy inflation. We continue to focus on cost containment, including productivity projects and R&D initiatives.\nOur other ceramic markets are slowing, and we are reducing our production to align with demand. Sales trends improved as we progress through the quarter, and we expect these markets will continue to improve. Our 2023 product launches with new sizes, unique visuals and polished finishes are being well accepted in the market.\nThe integration of our acquisitions is progressing and we are implementing specific sales, marketing and regional plans to improve the businesses. This year, we will convert the acquisitions to our information systems to enable operating as a single business and enhance efficiencies.\nIn our Flooring Rest of World segment, our European business have been compressed as high energy prices and inflation impacted consumer budgets. In the first quarter, higher volumes reduced shutdowns, lower energy costs and production of an energy improved our business from the fourth quarter. The contraction in the housing market has reduced volume levels in our industry as consumers change spending priorities and customers' adjusted inventory levels.\nWe are increasing promotions to attract additional volume and expanding product options for more constrained consumer budgets. We have increased controls to manage our cost and reduce our inventories. We are reengineering our formulations and expanding our supply base to improve our competitive position. We are executing our restructuring actions to adapt to the current environment. As input costs decline, we anticipate greater competitive pressures in the market.\nAs consumers have deferred residential remodeling projects, our flooring category was most impacted during the quarter. Both laminate and LVT volumes were lower in the quarter, and we are controlling our cost and production levels in response. We have begun the conversion of our residential LVT from flexible to rigid and are preparing to restructure the operations. Our sheet vinyl increased in volume as consumers sought options to lower remodeling costs. We are improving the product offering at our new Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition with updated styling as we enhance the facility's production efficiencies.\nOur panels business has slowed with market inventory reductions in the channel. Our margins are hot than anticipated due to stronger pricing, lower input costs and benefits from our biomass energy plans. We are making progress on achieving our planned synergies of our French panels plant and our recent mezzanine flooring acquisition.\nOur insulation category performed the best in this segment as energy efficiency become a greater priority. Government regulations around energy conservation continue to increase, and our polyurethane products provide the greatest heat-resistant properties. We have integrated our insulation acquisition in Ireland and the U.K., and our new facility is ramping up ahead of schedule.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the economies are slowing and inflation and higher interest rates have affected the housing market. In the quarter, our results were impacted by lower volumes in both residential soft and hard surfaces. We're implementing additional price increases to offset inflation and selectively introducing promotions to drive sales. The commercial sector is outperforming residential and we are expanding our emphasis in specified projects. We are controlling costs and adjusting inventory levels to market demand.\nOur Flooring North America segment has been challenged by significant inflation, higher interest rates and more restrictive lending, which have weakened the housing market and our industry. Many consumers are deferring home improvement investments or trading down due to budget constraints. As a result, our customers are more tightly managing their inventory levels.\nThe segment's earnings for the quarter were compressed due to lower volumes and absorption of peak material costs, which our pricing did not cover. We significantly reduced inventory as we align production with demand and benefited from lower energy and material costs. Our restructuring actions are on track and will lower our cost in our residential and commercial soft service categories.\nAs the market conditions evolve, we are adjusting our manufacturing and sales strategies and reducing inventory with market demand. To control cost, we are postponing capital projects and reducing discretionary spending. Our second quarter margin should expand as our input cost improved and plant utilization increases.\nOur first quarter commercial sales remained solid with new construction and remodeling projects continuing in most channels. The Architectural Billing Index indicates limited softening in the planning of new commercial projects this year. We are providing exciting flooring options that are carbon neutral with superior features to deliver greater value for the desiring green alternatives.\nDeveloped in partnership with disabled and disadvantaged artists, our new art lifting collections, fashionable designs are quickly gaining traction in the market. The commercial flooring accessories acquisition we completed last year has complemented our product offering and benefited our business.\nSales of residential soft services declined more than other categories as retailers reduced inventory due to weaker consumer discretionary spending in the slowing housing market. The multifamily business remains the strongest category in residential, and we are expanding our participation in this channel. Retailers have responded positively to our new product launches, including Everstrand Polyether collections at accessible price points and our proprietary SmartStrand silk collections that provide superior softness in design. The new merchandising systems for our new carpet collections are being well accepted by our customers.\nIn the quarter, we enhanced our LVT collections with higher value introductions, featuring our Web Protect and antimicrobial technologies. We're seeing a more competitive market as the industry slows and ocean freight costs decline. Imports from Asia are being interrupted as the U.S. requires proof of compliance with the Force Labor Protection Act. It is still too early to determine the disruption this legislation will create.\nSheet vinyl sales are outperforming as consumers seek more budget-oriented options. Our West Coast LVT plant is continuing to ramp up and our production will expand as we move through the year.\nDuring the quarter, our laminate sales in retail expanded with its increased acceptance of a waterproof alternative. Volumes in other channels are declining as consumers deferred remodeling projects and our customers reduced their inventory levels. We expect our Redwood collections to continue taking share due to the realistic visual, superior scratch resistance and waterproof properties. Our signature technology advances the design and texture of our Redwood products so that they are indistinguishable from premium wood flooring, by offering greater value and durability. Our input costs are declining, which will help us recover the inflation that impacted our margins.\nNow I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Our industry is operating in a completely different environment than a year ago. Around the world, Central Banks are raising interest rates to slow their economies and reduce inflation. These actions lower our industry volume as new home sales and residential remodeling are postponed. .\nThe commercial sector has remained stronger than residential, though higher interest rates and tighter lending requirements could affect business investments as the year progresses. We're maximizing our sales and distribution by focusing on better performing channels, introducing differentiated products and providing enhanced service and value. We are proactively managing our spending and cost structures to optimize our results. We anticipate that industry volume and pricing will remain under pressure across our markets. We expect seasonal improvement in demand along with reduced energy material costs to improve our future results. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.56 and $2.66, excluding any restructuring, acquisition and other charges.\nThe industry down -- this industry downturn is unique with employment remaining high, businesses continuing to invest and homes maintaining their valuations. We are conservatively managing the near term while we invest in the long-term growth through product innovation, capacity expansions and acquisitions. Our strong balance sheet enables us to navigate the current downturn as we prepare for the industry rebound that follows. Longer term, all of our regions require the updating of aging homes and significant new home construction to satisfy market needs. With strength across regions, markets and products, we anticipate capturing increased opportunities when the recovery occurs in the housing market and the economy.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk. Please go ahead.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's fourth quarter and full year performance and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn over the call to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. For the full year of '22, Mohawk's net sales were $11.7 billion, up approximately 4.8% as reported or 8.8% on a constant basis. And our adjusted EPS for the year was $12.85. The flooring industry entered '22 with momentum from strong housing markets supported by record home sales, low interest rates and rising household formations. High home equity levels, shift to larger homes and and the desire to customize living spaces during the pandemic were driving remodeling investments. As the year progressed, the U.S. housing market declined under pressure from rising interest rates and inflation. In Europe, energy and overall inflation escalated and consumers reduced discretionary spending to pay for essentials.\nIn the first half of the year, the company implemented pricing actions and production that offset the inflation we incur. With reduced home sales and remodeling in the second half of the year, our Flooring volumes decreased. Our pricing did not cover material and energy inflation. Throughout the year, commercial and new construction and remodeling activity outperformed Residential.\nEven with the housing industry slowing during the second half of the year, we concluded '22 with a strong balance sheet, low net debt leverage of 1.3x EBITDA and available liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion to manage the current environment and optimize our long-term results. We acquired 5 bolt-on businesses during the year that extend the scope of our product offering and our distribution. These include sheet vinyl, mezzanine flooring and wood veneer plant in Europe, a nonwoven flooring manufacturer and a flooring accessories company in the U.S.\nWhen we complete the integration of these acquisitions, we will expand their sales opportunities, enhance their operations and improve their efficiencies. We've just acquired Elizabeth in Brazil and are awaiting regulatory approval to close Vitromex in Mexico, both of which will almost double our local market positions in ceramic, expand our customer base and product offering and improve our manufacturing capabilities. The teams are preparing to integrate the businesses, which will create significant sales and operational synergies.\nTurning to the fourth quarter results. Mohawk net sales were $2.7 billion, down 4% as reported or approximately 1.3% on a constant basis, and our adjusted EPS was $1.32. Our revenues were driven by price increases and strength in commercial channel. Our sales across all our businesses were slower than we expected in the quarter as Residential sales contracted with rising interest rates, declining home sales and lower consumer confidence.\nAs a consequence, our customers lowered their inventory levels and consumers reduced their spending for renovation. Unlike other products, Flooring does not require immediate replacement. So purchases can be deferred more than other durable goods. Commercial sales continued stronger than Residential in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing remodeling and new construction projects. In the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment outperformed the others due to a higher level of commercial and new construction sales.\nOur Flooring Rest of the World segment softened as higher inflation and energy costs reduced demand in Europe. Our Flooring North America segment sales declined with lower residential activity and a reduction in customer inventory levels. The combination of weakening sales, plant shutdowns and the consumption of higher cost inventory decreased the segment's performance for the quarter.\nIn response, we reduced production rates and lowered our inventory to which increased unabsorbed overhead expenses. We curtailed spending across the enterprise, though inflation offset many of our initiatives. In both Flooring North America as well as Flooring Rest of the World, we're taking restructuring actions in specific areas to align our operations with the present market conditions. During the quarter, energy and material costs around the world began to decline which should positively affect our future results.\nWhile we're managing the present economic cycle, we're operating with a long-term perspective and expanding capacities in areas where we have the greatest growth potential in markets rebound. These include LVT, laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation. We have reduced our plant capital spending until we see greater certainty in our markets around the world. We recently announced an agreement to resolve the securities class action lawsuit filed in January 2020, though we believe the case is without merit, further litigation would be burdensome and expensive.\nWe reached a settlement of $60 million, a significant portion of which will be covered by insurance and is subject to court approval. We also settled a dispute with the Belgian tax authority regarding royalty income. Though we believe our position is correct, we settled the $187 million assessment for EUR 3 million. I'll turn the call over to Jim for a review of our fourth quarter financial performance.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just under $2.7 billion. That's a 4% decrease as reported or 1.3% on a constant basis. Favorable price/mix in the quarter was offset by reduced volume and unfavorable FX. The decrease was primarily driven by weakness in the U.S. as residential markets slowed more than expected in the quarter.\nGross margin, as reported, was 20.9% and excluding onetime items, was 22.4% versus 26.8% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher inflation of $263 million, offset by stronger price/mix of $269 million and productivity of $16 million. The fourth quarter margin was further negatively impacted by a weaker volume of $95 million, temporary plant shutdowns of $69 million and FX headwinds of $12 million. SG&A as reported was 18.6% of sales, excluding onetime items, was 17.9%, in line with the prior year.\nOn dollar basis, the favorable impact of FX of $12 million and volume of $3 million was partially offset by price/mix of $6 million and inflation of $3 million. Operating margin as reported was 2.3% for the quarter. Restructuring and onetime charges, $58 million including initiatives in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World and our disclosed litigation settlements.\nThe restructuring charges combined the initiatives announced in Q2 and a new project in Flooring Rest of the World to better align our LVT assets with market conditions. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 4.5%, and the year-over-year decline in operating income was primarily driven by higher inflation of $266 million, offset by price/mix of $263 million, productivity of $15 million, lower start-up and other items of $8 million, although these were not enough to counter the weaker volume of $92 million and increasing temporary plant shutdowns of $69 million.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $15 million, and other income -- other expense was a $10 million expense due to unfavorable impact of transactional FX. In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 12.6% versus 18.9% in the prior year. We are forecasting the full year 2023 tax rate to be between 21% and 22% with some quarterly variations. Earnings per share, as reported, was $0.52 and excluding charges, was $1.32. Turning to the segments. Global Ceramics had sales of $988 million. That's a 4% increase as reported and 5% on a constant basis. Actions to drive favorable price and mix across the segment and improved year-over-year volume in the U.S. offset weakening unit volumes in other geographies.\nOperating income, excluding charges, was $70 million, which is a 16.7% increase versus prior year and operating margin at 7.1% improved 70 basis points due to improved price/mix of $111 million, productivity gains of $17 million and favorable FX and other items of $8 million, offsetting the increase in inflation of $85 million, lower volume of $28 million and related increased temporary plant shutdowns of $14 million.\nFlooring North America had sales of $946 million. That's a 6.8% decrease versus prior year as weaker volumes was only partially offset by favorable price/mix. The volume decrease was primarily a result of declines in residential channels and customers lowering inventory levels with consumers deferring discretionary spending. On an adjusted basis, Flooring North America's operating margin was approximately breakeven.\nThe year-over-year decline in profitability was driven by weakening volume of $32 million, temporary plant shutdowns of $33 million, and the impact of higher cost inventory and other inflation flowing through the P&L of $109 million, only being partially offset by price/mix of $71 million and productivity of $8 million. We expect many of these issues to carry over to Q1 then in Q2 with seasonally stronger sales, lower costs and increased production levels, we should see a solid improvement in profitability.\nAnd finally, Flooring Rest of the World had sales of $717 million. That's a 9.9% decrease as reported and 2% on a constant basis. Installation products continued with strong growth in the quarter but it was not enough to compensate for declines seen in the Flooring categories, primarily Laminate and LVT as inflation resulted in consumers reducing discretionary spending and in turn, customers lowering inventory levels.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 7.7% for the quarter. Operating income declined versus prior year. It was a result of the decrease in volumes of $32 million, temporary plant shutdowns of $22 million, which contributed to lower productivity of $10 million and increases in inflation of $79 million, only partially offset by price/mix actions of $81 million for the quarter. With the business concentrated in residential channels, we expect a number of these issues to impact Q1, which results improving as we move through the year as lower energy and material costs should drive higher consumer spending.\nCorporate and eliminations was $6 million in Q4 and $37 million for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet. The company generated free cash flow of $91 million in the fourth quarter and over $165 million in the second half of 2022. Receivables for the quarter ended at $1.9 billion with the DSO at 60 days versus 56 days in the prior year, due in part to customer and channel mix. Inventories ended at just under $2.8 billion or a 17% increase versus prior year, but declined 4% versus the third quarter.\nThe year-over-year growth in inventory was primarily due to a spike in inflation. And sequentially, the decrease is primarily due to lowering of production levels to better align with demand. Inventory days ended at 138 days for the current year versus 131 in the third quarter. Property, plant and equipment ended at just shy of $4.7 billion and capital for the quarter was $151 million versus D&A of $159 million.\nFor the full year, CapEx ended at $581 million and D&A of $595 million. Our current view for 2023 is a forecast of $560 million for CapEx and D&A of $592 million, but we will adjust with the changing environment. And finally, the company maintains a strong overall balance sheet with gross debt of $2.8 billion and leverage at 1.3x adjusted EBITDA. This strength gives us the flexibility to manage through the challenging environment. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. The Global Ceramic segment increased sales and earnings with a higher mix of new residential construction and commercial sales than our overall business. Residential ceramic sales in all geographies are slowing and operating margins are contracting due to lower volumes and manufacturing shutdowns. The cost of energy and transportation are declining, which will benefit our margins as these costs flow through our inventory.\nIn the U.S., Ceramic sales and volume both increased as we benefited from our premium product offering, price increases and growing countertop business. Our collections with larger sizes and unique finishes, combined with specialized structures and shapes are enhancing our sales and mix. We're increasing our sales efforts in growing categories, including health care, hospitality and fitness as well as multifamily and build-for-rent homes. Cost inflation increased as higher energy and transportation expenses from prior periods were incurred. We are optimizing material supply chains and reengineering formulations to improve our costs.\nWe reduced our inventories during the quarter by lowering production and enhancing our import strategies. We are reducing discretionary spending and limiting capital investments. To support additional growth in our quartz countertop sales, we are adding manufacturing capacity by the end of this year. Our countertop mix continues to improve as we expand our premium collections featuring our advanced painting technology. Our Ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure with slowing demand, customer inventory reductions and inflation. Our cost in the quarter were impacted by peak energy prices in the third quarter and reductions in plant volumes from temporary shutdowns.\nWe are receiving energy subsidies in Italy, but we remain disadvantaged to some competitors who have long-term energy contracts. Natural gas prices have declined substantially, though disruptions could impact future costs. As Ceramic sales slow, the market is becoming more competitive. We are introducing new technologies to enhance surface textures, expand design capabilities and improve our costs. We are completing the expansion of our large porcelain slabs to support continued growth and enhance our styling.\nWe have successfully reformulated our body composition to use alternative materials. Sales in both Mexico and Brazil decelerated in the quarter as inflation and increasing interest rates reduced residential demand. We anticipate continued near-term weakness and have reduced production levels in both countries. To cover inflation, we are managing mix and pricing. Natural gas prices in the regions are declining in line with the worldwide market and will lower cost as it flows through inventory.\nWe have completed the acquisition of Elizabeth in Brazil and are awaiting regulatory approval to close Vitromex in Mexico. These acquisitions will position us as top producer in 2 of the world's largest ceramic markets. We anticipate significant synergies in all aspects of the businesses, which will enhance our sales and margins. We should be well positioned to leverage our combined strengths when the markets emerge from this downturn.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment was impacted by high inflation in energy prices and consumers reduced investments in Home Improvement. This caused a decline in Residential sales, which comprise a majority of the segment's business. As consumer spending slowed, our customers further reduced their inventory levels, which lowered market demand even more.\nIn response, we implemented temporary plant shutdowns and reduced our inventory levels, compressing our margins. Natural gas prices in Europe peaked at an unprecedented level in the third quarter, raising our material and production costs. Our pricing and mix did not fully cover inflation, which remains a headwind. We remain focused on optimizing volume with selective promotions as well as controlling costs until the business improves. To enhance our competitive position, we are increasing our supply chain from outside the European Union. We have initiated additional restructuring actions to align with current conditions.\nSince the beginning of 2023, gas prices have declined substantially and material costs should follow. Assuming this trend holds, Europe should see lower overall inflation with higher wages, consumer spending should increase. During the quarter, all of our European Flooring categories experienced significant volume declines with many residential remodeling projects being postponed as inflation eroded consumer discretionary spending.\nOur product/mix was impacted as homeowners purchased lower-priced flooring to maintain their budgets. We are launching new product collections and expanding promotional activities to improve our sales. Higher cost inventory will compress our margins until it flows through our costs.\nOur sheet vinyl sales outperformed our other flooring categories as consumers chose lower-priced alternatives. We are improving the small polish sheet vinyl plant we acquired in the third quarter by increasing its output, reducing its cost and expanding its distribution.\nWe are expanding our rigid LVT offering as it takes some share from flexible. We are increasing our existing operations and improving our formulation to lower our costs. We're adding new rigid production that make smaller runs with additional patented features. We will phase out of the residential-flexible LVT products and will close the supporting production. The cost of this new restructuring initiative is approximately $45 million with a cash cost of approximately $7.5 million resulting in annualized cost savings of $15 million and significantly increased sales.\nOur Insulation business is growing as conserving energy has become a higher priority and building requirements have increased. We selectively increased pricing to cover higher material costs, and we lowered production in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory levels. We are growing our sales and distribution in the U.K. as we start up our new insulation plan. Our Panels business has faced the same pressures as our other categories with softening demand and rising material prices.\nDuring the quarter, our customers continued to reduce their inventory levels, further impacting our sales. Anticipating higher winter wood and energy costs, we maintained our inventory levels going into the first quarter. Our investments in green energy have benefited our performance by reducing our reliance on higher cost gas and electricity. The integration of our recent mezzanine acquisition in Germany is progressing as planned.\nWe are defining best practices and utilizing our own manufacturing to replace source boards. Our business in Australia and New Zealand are slowing with the local economies as inflation and mortgage rates are impacting foreign sales. We are taking actions to align our cost and inventory levels with the expected volume decline. We have announced additional price increases and are initiating selective promotions to maximize our sales.\nWe are updating our product offering and enhancing our merchandising to capture greater market share. As in other categories, commercial sales are stronger than Residential, and we are increasing our participation in specified projects. For the quarter, Flooring North America sales decreased faster than anticipated, primarily due to declines in residential channels, rug and customer inventory reductions. With inflation and interest rates at high levels, many consumers defer discretionary spending or traded down to lower cost products.\nEarnings in the segment were compressed due to lower sales, consumption of higher-cost materials, reduced inventory levels and temporary plant shutdowns. Our hard surface products outperformed soft and the commercial sector remains stronger than residential with hospitality showing the most growth. In response to slower market conditions, we are completing our restructuring actions, deferring capital projects and reducing discretionary spending.\nDuring 2022, we reduced our costs through process enhancements and rationalization of less efficient facilities while absorbing historically high inflation. We continue to adjust our strategies to manage the near-term market conditions, reductions in energy and materials should become a tailwind in the second quarter. Our Commercial business remains solid as remodeling and new construction projects continue. We maintained strong margins in the quarter with pricing and mix offsetting inflation. Our flexible LVT products are a preferred alternative that provides versatile styling with easy installation.\nThe combination of our carpet tile and LVT collections enables the customization of commercial spaces with unique designs. Our integration of a small flooring accessories acquisition is proceeding well. The company produces rubber baseboards and stair treads used in commercial installations and broadens our current flooring accessory business. In the fourth quarter, sales of residential soft services declined more than other categories, sales weakened as retailers reduced inventory with declining consumer sentiment and home sales.\nThe multifamily channel was the strongest performer, and we are realigning resources focused more on this sector. As demand dropped in the quarter, we increased temporary shutdowns, which resulted in higher, unabsorbed costs. We have significantly lowered inventories in the fourth quarter and are reducing costs by eliminating less efficient manufacturing, enhancing productivity and adjusting production to demand. Participation in our recent flooring roadshows was at a record level with leading retailers expressing optimism about the year ahead.\nOur rug sales were lower as national retailers continue to adjust inventories with reduced consumer spending. We are restructuring our rug operations to lower cost and align production with demand. The integration of our nonwoven rug and carpet acquisition is progressing well and provides new opportunities with our existing customers.\nOur resilient sales grew in the quarter as we leveraged our WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies to differentiate our collections. We offset inflation through pricing and mix, though increased plant shutdowns resulted in higher unabsorbed costs and lower margins. We are introducing new collections to expand our offering while eliminating less productive SKUs. Our sheet vinyl sales were higher as consumers pursue budget-friendly flooring options and the multifamily channel strengthen. The first phase of our new West Coast LVT plant is operating at expected levels. We are preparing new technologies that will improve our cost and add differentiated features.\nWe will install additional production lines and train personnel throughout this year. Our Premium Laminate sales were impacted by slowing retail traffic and customer inventory adjustment. Our Laminate is gaining acceptance as an alternative waterproof product in all channels. During the quarter, we offset inflation through pricing and mix though our margins were impacted by lower absorption from temporary shutdowns as we reduced our inventory.\nWe are beginning to see reductions in material inflation, which should help us recover our costs. Our new manufacturing line, which began last year, is operating at planned levels and will deliver our next generation of Laminate features. With its industry-leading design and performance, our Laminate business is in an excellent position to capitalize on the growing Waterproof Flooring category.\nNow I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. The flooring industry is slowing due to higher interest rates, sustained inflation and low consumer confidence. The visibility of the depth and duration of this cycle is limited and conditions differ across the world. Mohawk has a strong record of managing these downturns by proactively executing the necessary actions. We're adjusting our business for the current conditions by reducing production level, inventory, cost structures and capital expenditures. We're implementing restructuring actions in both Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World to streamline operations, reduce SG&A and rationalize higher-cost assets.\nIn the first quarter, we anticipate more pressure on pricing and mix due to the low industry volumes. Our inventory costs remain elevated in most products due to the higher material and energy that we incurred in earlier periods. Additionally, we will not raise production as normal in the first quarter to prepare for future demand, increasing our unabsorbed costs. Our cost of energy have fallen and should benefit our global margins as our inventory turn.\nOur second quarter results should have sequentially stronger improvement with seasonally higher sales, increased production and lower material costs. Significantly lower cost of energy in Europe should enhance consumer spending, discretionary purchases and flooring demand. We're refocusing our sales teams on the channels that are performing the best in the current environment. We're introducing new innovative collections and merchandising as well as targeted promotions to improve sales.\nGiven these factors, we anticipate our first quarter EPS to be between $1.24 and $1.34, excluding restructuring and other charges. Around the world, the long-term demand for housing will require significant investments in new construction and remodeling. Mohawk is uniquely positioned with a comprehensive array of innovative products, industry-leading distribution and strength in all sales channels. We're implementing structural changes to navigate the industry's challenges while optimizing our future results.\nWe anticipate coming out of this downturn in a stronger position as we benefit from our bolt-on acquisitions, enhanced market positions in Brazil and Mexico and strategic expansion of our high-growth product categories. Our balance sheet is well positioned to manage the current cycle and to drive future growth and profitability. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nMohawk's third quarter sales increased to $2.9 billion, up 3.6% as reported or approximately 8.3% on a constant basis, primarily from price increases and strength in the commercial sector. Our sales in the quarter were weaker than we anticipated as sales in the retail channel softened across all regions and product categories.\nThe strengthening dollar also negatively impacted our translated sales for the quarter by $117 million, or 4.1%. Our operating income declined as lower volume resulted in higher unabsorbed costs, and material energy and transportation inflation impacted our results. Our global organization responded to the economic challenges with additional actions to optimize cost, productivity and inventory levels.\nThere are substantial differences in the economic conditions affecting our various global markets and product categories. Our businesses in Europe have been impacted more than others due to the unprecedented energy crisis and high inflation that has slowed the region's economy. Recently, spot gas prices in Europe have fallen drastically, though future prices have not correspondingly declined.\nOur costs have continued to rise and our pricing in Europe has not kept up with recent material and energy inflation, which has compressed our margins. The Italian government provided energy subsidies during the third quarter, and additional actions from both the European Union and individual countries are being discussed. The high cost of energy has forced European consumers to concentrate on necessities and defer discretionary purchases. Our sales and margins in the market will remain under pressure until the region overcomes these challenges. These postponed purchases will increase demand when the economy rebounds and enhance our results.\nThe U.S. is being more impacted by higher overall inflation and mortgage rates that have risen from below 3% to approximately 7%. The residential market, which is the most significant part of our business, is expected to decline further before we see an inflection point. Remodeling has slowed, and our product mix has been impacted as consumers trade down to options that better fit their budgets. It is estimated that the U.S. has a housing deficit of 5 million units, and more than half of U.S. homes are over 50 years old. Remodeling investments are expected to grow long term as U.S. housing stock ages and families with low mortgages choose to remain in their homes.\nUp until this point, our other geographies have been less impacted by inflation and higher interest rates. Our selling prices in those regions are better aligned with our costs and their margins remain strong even with their economy slowing. While we manage through the current conditions, we're also investing in our businesses for the long term. We're expanding our capacity in growing product categories, including LVT, laminate, quartz countertops and premium ceramic and insulation. These projects should satisfy strengthening demand as our markets recover.\nWe have recently completed a number of smaller acquisitions that will enhance our product offering and leverage our existing market positions. In Europe, these include a sheet vinyl business, a mezzanine flooring company and a wood veneer plant. In the U.S., we acquired a nonwoven flooring producer and a flooring accessories company. We're awaiting government approval of our Vitromex acquisition, which combined with our legacy business will make us the #2 ceramic producer in Mexico.\nOur strong balance sheet provides us with additional opportunities to enhance our business. We recently published our 13th annual environmental, social and governance report, which highlights how doing what's right for the people and the planet is also benefiting our business. Our sustainable products excite both residential and commercial customers, and our bottom line is enhanced by increasing recycled content, reducing waste and lowering our water and energy consumption.\nNow Jim will review our third quarter financial performance.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.9 billion. That's a 3.6% increase as reported or 8.3% on a constant basis due to the favorable impact of price and product mix, partially offset by declining volume and unfavorable FX. Gross margin for the quarter, as reported, was 24.5%, and excluding onetime items, was 25.6% versus 29.8% in the prior year.\nThe year-over-year margin decrease is due to lower demand, increasing temporary manufacturing shutdowns, lower sales volume and FX headwinds, partially offset by productivity and pricing and mix, which successfully offset the increased year-over-year inflation impact. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in our MD&A of the 10-Q, which we filed after the call. SG&A as reported was 17.9% of sales and 16.3% excluding onetime items. And the adjusted absolute dollar expense was slightly favorable due to the impact of FX and cost containment actions, partially offset by inflation and price and mix.\nOperating margin as reported was a negative 17.3%, but excluding charges, was 9.3%, as the company's current market capitalization along with challenging economic conditions and higher discount rates resulted in a noncash goodwill and trade name impairment charge of $696 million in the quarter. The 9.3% operating margin, excluding charges, is 350 basis points decrease versus prior year, primarily driven by higher inflation, temporary plant shutdowns, which accounted for $55 million of the decrease in operating income, and lower volumes, which accounted for $45 million of the decrease in operating income; partially offset by favorable price and mix and productivity gains along with net FX.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $14 million, in line with prior year, reflecting the full benefit of paying off the 2021 Eurobond late in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.9% for Q3 versus 21.4% in the prior year. We expect the Q4 tax rate to be approximately 20%, bringing the full year 2022 rate to approximately 21%. That leads us to an earnings per share, excluding charges, of $3.34.\nNow turning to the segments. In Global Ceramic, sales were just shy of $1.1 billion. That's a 9.8% increase as reported or 12.4% on a constant basis. Favorable pricing and mix initiatives more than compensated for the volume declines in the quarter. The sales growth was led by Europe, U.S. and Brazil. Operating income, excluding charges, was $132 million, increasing approximately 11% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 12.1% due to strong price and mix actions, which offset higher year-over-year inflation, productivity gains and net favorable FX, partially offset by lower volumes.\nIn Flooring North America, sales were just under $1.1 billion as well. That's a 3.7% increase year-over-year as reported. The growth in commercial, laminate and resilient offset weakness in residential carpet and rugs. Similar to Q2, excluding the decline in the major retailers' rug demand, the reduction of that demand, net sales increased approximately 8% versus prior year.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 8%, equating to a 340 basis point decline versus prior year, due to the higher inflation, which was nearly offset by price and mix initiatives, temporary plant shutdowns, and lower sales volumes; partially offset by productivity gains.\nAnd finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $731 million. That's a decrease of 4.8% as reported, but an increase of 9.4% on a constant basis, with price and mix actions driving solid growth in panels, Oceania and the insulation businesses.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 8.5%, a significant decrease versus prior year. The primary drivers of the decline were higher inflation, partially offset by the price and mix actions, temporary plant shutdowns, and related unfavorable productivity plus lower sales volumes. Corporate and elimination costs were $11 million for the quarter, and expect the full year to be between $40 million and $45 million.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Cash for the quarter ended at $327 million, with free cash flow of $75 million in the quarter. Receivables ended at just over $2 billion, with DSOs slightly higher at 58 days compared to 57 in the prior year. Inventories for the quarter ended at $2.9 billion. That's a 31% increase versus prior year, but a 3% increase versus the second quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by inflation making up approximately 76% of the increase, and versus prior year -- prior quarter, excuse me, inflation and acquisitions drive the increase. Q3 inventory days stand at 131 days.\nProperty, plant and equipment was just over $4.5 billion, with Q3 capital spending at $150 million and D&A at $153 million. To better align with the slowing demand, we have aggressively reduced our full year capital plan by 20% to approximately $620 million, with B&A projected at $559 million.\nAnd finally, our balance sheet is in a very strong position with liquidity exceeding $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter, with the planned payout of our 2023 $600 million bond in November and net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.2x, enabling us to manage through the current environment and optimize long-term results.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Chris.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Our Global Ceramic Segment delivered the strongest performance during the quarter, even with substantial inflation headwinds in Europe. Sales in new home construction channel were solid in most geographies, and the commercial channel showed resilience with new construction and remodeling projects continuing.\nIn most markets, residential remodeling has slowed due to tightening consumer discretionary spending and higher interest rates. We are managing through pricing and mix to reduce the impact of material and energy inflation on our cost. Natural gas prices remain in a major headwind, with volatile pricing in Europe significantly impacting our results.\nRecently, European spot gas prices have declined significantly as available storage nears capacity, though the future pricing for the winter has not followed the decline. Across the segment, we continue to reduce SG&A spending, operational costs and capital projects to align with market conditions. Sales in our U.S. ceramic business expanded during the quarter, with the greatest growth in the commercial and home construction sectors. Residential remodeling demand continued to lag in the retail channel, and customers are reducing orders to better align their inventories.\nDuring the quarter, our margins were driven by our pricing actions, and strong commercial sales improved our mix. We are gaining support with our new higher-margin introductions that are an alternative to European imports. To offset material inflation, we are identifying further process improvements utilizing alternative materials and reformulating glazes. To align with seasonal demand and manage our inventory, we are scaling back production in the fourth quarter and reducing sourced purchases.\nOur countertop sales grew during the quarter, led by our high-end quartz collections. Our quartz manufacturing plant is operating at full capacity, and we are sourcing products from around the world to satisfy demand. We expect that our new quartz production line will start up in early 2024 and will allow us to further expand our sales and improve our mix.\nOur European ceramic results in the quarter exceeded our expectations due to our sales and pricing actions, positive mix and Italian energy subsidy. Subsidies are approved through November and may extend further. During the quarter, sales of our premium collections remained strong, while increased gas prices impacted our outdoor and lower-end products.\nEuropean consumers are postponing residential flooring investments as high energy costs squeeze their budgets. Given lower spot gas prices and government subsidies, we are increasing production in the fourth quarter to raise inventory levels and improve service. In the first quarter, we anticipate lower production rates with winter energy prices expected to peak. Our operations teams are adjusting our production across our European plants to optimize mix, cost and flexibility as demand evolves. We have addressed the shortage of Ukrainian clay by reengineering formulations with material from alternative sources.\nIn our other markets, third quarter sales grew primarily through pricing, mix and strengthening the commercial channel. Mexico's central bank has implemented additional interest rate increases, which is slowing the economy and ceramic sales.\nIn Brazil, interest rates remain high and retail sales are slowing. We are increasing our activities in the A&D community and expanding our commercial product offering. Our pricing actions improved mix and productivity gains enhanced results. All businesses are reducing production in the fourth quarter, which will increase our costs.\nOur team in Mexico has a detailed strategy to integrate our Vitromex acquisition to optimize short-term results. The combined organization will have a stronger product offering and a competitive position to address the $1.7 billion Mexican ceramic market. Government approval of the transaction may be finalized in the first quarter.\nFor the quarter, Flooring Rest of the World sales rose year-over-year, primarily from price increases and growth in our panels, insulation and Oceania businesses. The segment sales are mostly residential and were more impacted by constrained consumer spending. In Europe, inflation is reducing discretionary purchases, so we did not see the typical seasonal improvement after the summer holidays. The retail sector is reducing inventories and consumers are trading down in all categories.\nOur margins in the quarter were compressed by inflation, lower sales volume and reduced production. The weakening markets are making additional price increases more difficult to implement. Natural gas prices in the period temporarily reached 12x historical levels and governments are reviewing ways to assist industry and consumers with the spike in gas and electricity prices. Our wood supply and pricing is also being impacted, as it is being consumed as an alternative source for both heat and electricity.\nAs flooring sales softened, we increased promotional activity to encourage consumers to trade up. While our premium laminate and LVT faced greater pressures, our more value-oriented sheet vinyl sales grew. In the quarter, we implemented price increases that partially offset rising material and energy costs.\nWe anticipate sales volumes in the fourth quarter will remain weak and we are reducing production, substituting alternative materials, implementing process improvements and postponing noncritical projects. We completed the acquisition of a small Polish sheet vinyl producer that will expand our business in Central and Eastern Europe. Our urethane insulation products provide the highest thermal resistance as consumers seek ways to reduce energy costs.\nNew building projects in Western Europe are beginning to slow, and we are enhancing our distribution by expanding our customer base and exports. Our selling prices were slightly behind inflation and we are reviewing alternatives to optimize our costs. Our new insulation plant in the U.K. continues to ramp up as we increase our sales and distribution.\nOur panels results weakened as demand softened and competition intensified. Our margins declined due to the impact of lower sales and production volumes from the weakening market. The French panels plant we acquired last year is increasing sales, and we have improved its productivity and operating expenses. We expanded the distribution of our higher-end decorative panels and acquired a small mezzanine flooring company that will bolt on to our existing business.\nIn Oceania, our sales improved primarily from pricing and mix. The Australian market is improving as the country relaxes COVID restrictions, and New Zealand is more difficult with residential sales weakening. Our increased pricing is covering inflation, and inventories increased as imported material arrived faster than expected.\nFor the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales increased primarily from pricing. The commercial sector was stronger than residential, with hospitality leading the other channels. Hard surface products outperformed, benefiting from technology and capital investments in premium laminate and LVT. The residential market softened as inflation impacted consumer discretionary spending and retailers reduced their inventories.\nOur pricing in the period offset material and energy inflation. The lower manufacturing volumes led to unfavorable absorption. We managed our sales, marketing and administration spending to align with volumes and offset inflation. We are implementing our restructuring plans to lower both our fixed and variable costs by shutting higher-cost assets, reducing staffing and aligning production with demand. We are executing many projects to improve productivity, reduce waste, reengineer products and lower energy costs. We are also deferring nonessential capital projects to align with the present environment.\nOur residential sales continued to improve, with our strongest performance in the new home construction, multifamily and commercial channels. We have introduced assortments tailored to regional preferences and optimized our portfolio to improve productivity and service. Our WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies are being well accepted as desirable features by consumers.\nSheet vinyl sales strengthened as inflation has increased in value-oriented flooring options. The first phase of our new West Coast LVT plant is operating at planned output levels. We are ramping up production and training the workforce for additional lines that will be installed throughout next year. Our East and West Coast operations will enhance service to our customers, lower our cost and improve transportation efficiencies. Demand for our premium laminate continued to grow as high-performing value alternatives to other flooring.\nSales of our waterproof collections and more realistic visuals are expanding in all channels. Inflation in other materials has reduced our margins, though we are beginning to see some cost decline. Our new manufacturing line is operating at our targeted levels to satisfy increasing demand. We have commitment to saturate our current capacity and have initiated further expansion investments.\nMarket conditions for carpet softened in the third quarter more than we had anticipated, and we reduced production, resulting in unabsorbed costs. In the second quarter, we announced price increases that were implemented in the third quarter as inflation continued to rise. With demand softening, we were not able to increase prices further to recover the inflation after the announcement. We are seeing reductions in raw material costs that should align with our current pricing when our higher cost inventory is depleted. To reduce our cost, we are eliminating less efficient capacity, streamlining operations and lowering marketing and administration costs, as well as reducing production to lower inventories.\nOur commercial business remains good, and Architectural Billing Index reflects continued construction activity. The hospitality channel grew the strongest as postponed projects and renovation are increasing demand. Our margins remain strong as pricing and mix covered our inflation in the quarter. Our commercial hard surface sales growth is outpacing carpet, with flexible LVT being the preferred option. Our new, more sustainable carpet tile, Ecoflex 1, is gaining acceptance with its low carbon footprint, recycled content and acoustic advantages.\nTo complement our flooring accessories business, we acquired a small rubber manufacturer that produces trim primarily used with commercial installations. The acquisition expands our current accessories business, which produces laminate, vinyl and wood trim. In the quarter, sales in our rug business were lower than last year as major national retailers continued to adjust inventories. We are taking restructuring actions to reduce our costs and lower our production with demand. In July, we completed the acquisition of a nonwoven rug and carpet business, and the integration is delivering synergies. With that, I'll return the call to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. It's challenging to predict either the duration of the current economic conditions or the impact on our industry. As central banks around the world continue to raise interest rates and inflation reduces the discretionary expenditures, we expect our business to remain under pressure. Residential remodeling drives the majority of our sales, and customers are deferring purchases and trading down.\nIn Europe, gas and electricity prices are reducing demand and increasing our manufacturing and material costs. We anticipate that governments in Europe will take action to lower the impact on the economy, businesses and consumers. We're focused on managing through the current environment while investing to maximize our long-term profitability. We anticipate demand will slow further in the fourth quarter, and we will reduce production, resulting in greater unabsorbed overhead.\nTo enhance sales, we're increasing promotional activity, introducing differentiated collections and reacting to competitive actions. We are executing restructuring actions, lowering administrative and manufacturing costs and reducing investment in marketing. Material prices spiked in the period and have begun softening in many categories.\nIn Europe, flooring projects are being deferred, compressing industry volumes, and we are raising inventories of specific products ahead of higher energy costs this winter. After our second quarter U.S. pricing announcement, we incurred peak carpet material costs that will compress our margins until they flow through our inventory. We are postponing capital projects that do not impact our long-term strategies while completing those that are critical to near-term performance of the business.\nFinally, we expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue to reduce our translated results. Given these factors, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.40 to $1.50, excluding any restructuring charges.\nDuring the past decades, Mohawk has successfully managed through many challenging periods and industry recessions. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and floor remains an essential component of all new construction and remodeling. Mohawk has built leading positions in key markets around the globe with well-known brands and extensive product offering. During this period, we're investing for the market rebound that always occurs after our industry contracts.\nWe're expanding our higher-growth categories of LVT, laminate, quartz countertops, premium ceramic and insulation, which will increase our revenue and profitability with the next growth cycle. We've also made strategic bolt-on acquisitions for our business that create significant synergies that will enhance the combined results. Mohawk has a strong balance sheet with low net debt of 1.2x EBITDA and available liquidity exceeding $1.8 billion to manage through the current environment and optimize our long-term results. We'll now be glad to take your questions."

My name is Victoria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Mohawk Industries Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, July 29, 2022. Thank you.\nI would like to introduce Mr. James Brunk. Mr. Brunk, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's second quarter and provide guidance for the third quarter.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening comments. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Mohawk's second quarter sales rose to $3.2 billion, up 6.7% as reported or approximately 11.1% on a constant basis. Sales grew in all our segments, with our top line results benefiting from price increases, enhanced product mix, improvements in commercial, and contributions from our small acquisitions.\nAs the quarter progress, the global economic environment became increasingly challenging, and our organizations implemented additional actions to support our performance. Our operating income for the quarter was in line with our expectations, even as material, energy and transportation, inflation remained a significant headwind and our translated results were impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nOver the past 18 months, all of our businesses have faced extraordinary inflation, and we have instituted multiple price increases to pass through these higher costs. We're also taking numerous operational actions, including cost controls, productivity improvements, mix and logistics enhancements.\nAcross our markets, inflation is causing changes in consumers' discretionary spending. U.S. housing sales have been impacted more than our other markets as mortgage rates have risen faster. Unlike past economic cycles, housing demand exceeds the available supply and foreclosures are not an issue.\nIn Europe, interest rates have not risen as much as the U.S., though consumer discretionary spending is being eroded by energy and other inflation, which is impacting demand. Volatility in natural gas supplies have caused a dramatic spike in near-term prices and supplies and pricing remain uncertain. The European countries are considering strategies for alternative supply, ways to ration gas and subsidies to support those most affected.\nIn most regions, investments in commercial construction and remodeling remains solid. Both projects that were deferred due to the pandemic and new projects are being initiated in greater numbers as the commercial sector continues to strengthen. As we navigate the near-term market dynamics, Mohawk's strong balance sheet provides many options for investments, including internal expansion, acquisition and stock buybacks.\nDuring the second quarter, we announced approximately $440 million in new acquisitions, with the largest being an agreement to acquire Vitromex, a leading ceramic manufacturer in Mexico. In early July, we completed the acquisition of Foss Floors, a leading U.S. needle punch flooring manufacturer. In Europe, we are making excellent progress in integrating our 2021 bolt-on insulation and panels acquisition, we're contributing -- which are contributing to our results as expected. We continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities.\nOur expansion projects remain on schedule, including laminate, LVT, quartz countertops and European porcelain slabs. These investments will help us satisfy current and future demand as well as deliver our next generation of product innovation and operational efficiency.\nNow Jim will review our second quarter financial performance in greater detail.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just under $3.2 billion. That's a 6.7% increase as reported, or 11.1% on a constant days and FX basis, representing a second consecutive record quarterly sales. Favorable sales and mix across all segments and benefit of our 2021 small acquisitions, offsetting softening volume and negative impact of FX.\nGross margin for the quarter was 27.7%, a decrease from prior year 30.7%, excluding charges. Although the dollar amounts and impact of year-over-year inflation, primarily in raw materials and energy was more than offset by price mix and productivity, it was not enough to negate the impact of the lower unit volumes, temporary shutdowns and FX headwinds on a percentage basis. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A of our 10-Q, which will be filed after the call.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 16% for the quarter as tight spending controls by the business drove a 90 basis points improvement versus the prior year. The immaterial increase in absolute expense was due to higher sales, price mix and inflation, primarily offset by cost-saving initiatives and the impact of FX.\nOperating income as percentage of sales was 11.7%, which is a 220 basis point decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower volume as the business drove price mix and productivity initiatives to offset significant year-over-year inflation and the impact of temporary plant shutdowns and FX. Interest expense for the quarter was $12 million, slightly down from the year and other income, other expense was income of $3 million.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 22% versus 22.5% in the prior year. We expect the full year tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. That leads us to an earnings per share as reported of $4.40, or excluding charges of $4.41.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic and sales of just under $1.2 billion, it's an 11.5% increase as reported or 14.6% on a constant base and FX basis as pricing and mix actions more than offset the softening volume in the segment. Operating income for the quarter, excluding charges, was $154 million or 13.3%. That is an operating profit increase of 12.5% versus the prior year. The favorable product mix, pricing and productivity actions offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation, which is primarily due to rising energy costs.\nIn Flooring North America, our sales were $1.1 billion for an increase of 1.7% versus the prior year with pricing actions offsetting volume declines. Growth in commercial, laminate and resilient products offset weakness in residential carpet and a significant adjustment in rug products during the quarter.\nThe rug business is concentrated with major national retailers who dramatically cut orders to reduce their inventory levels. Now absent this adjustment, Flooring North American sales would have increased approximately 6.5% in the quarter.\nOperating margin as a percentage of sales was 9.1%, which is a 210 basis points decrease versus prior year, as improvements in price mix and productivity initiatives were unable to compensate for the lower overall volumes and increased input costs, primarily in raw materials due to year-over-year inflation.\nIn Flooring Rest of the World, sales were $895 million or a 7.7% increase as reported or 18.8% on a constant FX basis. Pricing and mix actions drove the improvement across all product lines, led by panels and insulation, along with the year-over-year benefit from the smaller acquisitions. Operating margin as percentage of sales was 14.1%, with a decline of about 560 basis points versus prior year. The main drivers to the decrease was higher inflation, mainly raw material, unfavorable productivity with temporary plant shutdowns and lower volume, especially compared to the peak output in 2021 Q2, partially offset by favorable price and mix initiatives. Corporate and elimination costs were $10 million for Q2, with full year corporate and elimination cost as may be between $40 million and $45 million.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash ended the quarter at $224 million, with free cash flow relatively flat for the quarter, primarily due to increases in working capital driven by the impact of inflation and increasing sales. Receivables were just over $2.1 billion, with DSO slightly higher at 56 days compared to 53 in the prior year.\nInventories finished the quarter at just over $2.8 billion. That's an increase of 36% from prior year of $740 million. 70% of which was inflation related, and that was also an increase of about 12% versus Q1. Inventory days finished the quarter at 116 days, slightly up from Q1 at 111 days.\nProperty, plant and equipment finished the quarter at just under $4.6 billion, with CapEx of $151 million and depreciation and amortization of $142 million. For the full year, depreciation and amortization are forecast to approximately $570 million and CapEx at $785 million.\nFinally, our balance sheet is in a very strong position with overall $1 billion of liquidity and net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.1x, enabling our business to continue to grow through internal investments, acquisitions and stock buybacks.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for our operational review.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Of our 3 segments, Global Ceramic delivered the best performance during the second quarter with significant year-over-year operating income improvement, of which the greatest part came from the U.S. ceramic business.\nBuilder sales remained strong in most of our ceramic markets, and an increased number of commercial renovation and new construction projects were also initiated. Most of our markets have seen some softening in residential activity as inflation and higher interest rates affected remodeling investments.\nThe cost of natural gas continued to rise across the world, with European natural gas prices spiking again due to supply uncertainty. As energy and raw material price increases across our ceramic businesses, we continue to implement new pricing actions.\nOur U.S. ceramic business expanded its operating income to its highest level in 4 years. The commercial and new home construction sector showed the strongest growth, with softening demand in residential remodeling and the home center channel.\nDuring the quarter, our mix and margins were enhanced by improved commercial sales. Our premium product introductions are gaining traction in the market as alternatives to higher-cost European imports. We continue to improve our sales and manufacturing costs with productivity initiatives and improved product discipline. To offset higher energy, material and transportation costs, we continue to implement price increases and freight surcharges.\nWe have introduced new distribution strategies to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs. Our countertop sales are growing in the high-end quartz, porcelain and stone categories. Our quartz countertop plant is operating at maximum capacity, and we are improving our mix by expanding our premium product offering. To meet growing demand, we are sourcing products and expanding our countertop production.\nOur European ceramic business improved sequentially during the quarter with higher sales and enhanced mix. Though our pricing actions during the quarter improved our margins, they did not fully offset inflation versus the prior year. We continue to invest in innovative new features to improve our mix and add capacity to satisfy growing demand for our porcelain slab business.\nSales of our premium products increased during the quarter, while our low and medium price categories softened as they are more sensitive to price changes. Our inventory levels remain historically low and are further limiting our overall sales. Our R&D teams are reengineering body formulations with alternative materials and reducing the use of Ukrainian clays.\nRecently, reduced supplies of natural gas have significantly increased energy prices across Europe. Going forward, our volume and margins will be under greater pressure as our gas costs will be higher. We are initiating restructuring actions to lower our costs and manage these market conditions.\nIn our other international ceramic markets, sales growth was primarily driven by pricing and mix with commercial outpacing residential. Our results in these regions could have been stronger if our sales were not limited by production constraints and low inventory levels.\nOur pricing actions and improved mix are offsetting higher energy and material costs. The impact of inflation on energy and materials in these regions has not abated, and we have announced additional price increases to offset higher costs. Across these regions, we are beginning to see softening in the residential sector as inflation and rising interest rates impact consumer spending and home purchases.\nIn June, we agreed to acquire Vitromex, a leading ceramic tile manufacturer in Mexico, for $293 million. The company produces clay ceramic, porcelain, mosaic and decorative tiles and has a broad distribution network. Vitromex operates 4 manufacturing facilities and had approximately $200 million in sales last year.\nCeramic is the primary flooring category in Mexico, and the market has grown even 11% per year in pesos over the last 5 years. In 2021, the Mexican ceramic tile market generated sales of $1.7 billion or about 2.9 billion square feet. During the past 10 years, we have significantly expanded our participation in the Mexican ceramic market by investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing and developing world-class operations and sales organization. Together with Vitromex, we anticipate many opportunities to expand the product offerings, distribution and efficiencies of the combined enterprise.\nIn the quarter, Flooring Rest of World sales rose year-over-year, primarily from price increases, product mix and contributions from our small panels and insulation acquisitions. Inflation is increasing household cost and reducing consumer disposable income. We are seeing a slowdown in retail traffic, which is reducing industry volume in most categories.\nEuropean energy prices are substantially higher than in other regions and are significantly impacting our raw material and electricity costs. We have raised prices as inflation continue to rise and announced further increases as natural gas and chemical prices escalated at the end of the quarter.\nOur wood costs are also rising as it is being increasingly utilized as a substitute for natural gas to provide heat and electricity.\nOur flooring sales softened as we progress through the quarter, and our customers are reducing their inventories. Laminate, LVT and sheet vinyl are all following similar demand trends. In the period, our costs continue to escalate and material supply improved. We implemented price increases during the quarter and have announced additional price increases for the third quarter. We're seeing actions to address the changing environment, including cost reductions, process improvement and postponing noncritical projects.\nOur insulation business continues to deliver excellent results with growth in volume as well as price. We have passed through rising chemical costs and are integrating our recent acquisition. Our new manufacturing plant is adding a second shift as we ramp up our sales and distribution. Sales of insulation products remain strong as they benefit from increasing investments to reduce energy costs.\nOur panels business performed well, though volumes slowed as we progressed through the quarter. We continue to raise prices and improve our mix with higher-value products. We're integrating the small French panels plant that we acquired last year and are improving its cost and output. We are expanding the distribution of our higher-end decorative panels and more durable HPL products. Our investments in energy production from waste wood are benefiting both our cost and the environment.\nFor the quarter, our Flooring North America segment growth was primarily driven by pricing gains, stronger commercial sales and improved mix. The commercial sector improved across all channels, while the residential market is softening as consumers face the pressure of household inflation and rising interest rates.\nAs our service levels improve, customers reduced their inventory in the residential channel. We continue to execute pricing actions to offset material and energy inflation, though lower plant volumes are reducing absorption and raising costs. We are strategically investing to maximize our share in the faster-growing LVT and premium laminate categories. We have launched numerous productivity initiatives to mitigate the impact of fuel, freight, energy and labor inflation.\nOur LVT sales continued to improve with our new products gaining traction in the market. We experienced fewer material disruptions in the quarter, which furthered operational improvements and benefited our margins. Our new West Coast LVT plant has begun shipping to customers, and we continue to refine processes to improve throughput, productivity and material costs.\nOur East and West Coast operations will provide superior service to our customers and improve our transportation efficiencies. Our premium laminate is mostly used in residential remodeling, and inventory adjustments in home centers impacted our sales in the quarter. Our waterproof laminate collections are increasing our sales in the specialty retail and new construction channels as an alternative to LVT.\nOur new manufacturing line continues to ramp up to targeted production levels and is fulfilling demand for our next-generation products. Though we have raised laminate prices, our raw material costs continue to increase substantially.\nAs the commercial sector rebounds, sales and margins of our carpet, tile and commercial LVT collections are improving. All channels continue to expand with the recovery in the hospitality and corporate sectors accelerating. Based on the most recent Architectural Billing Index, commercial design activity remains strong with a pipeline of projects that support continued sales growth for the foreseeable future. To offset raw material and transportation inflation, we are taking additional pricing actions as well as reducing costs across the business.\nAs our residential carpet volumes declined due to softening markets and inventory reductions in the channel, we are aligning capacity with demand, reducing expenses and announcing additional price increases due to continued material and energy inflation.\nOur rug business is concentrated with major national retailers. And during the quarter, they all dramatically cut orders to reduce inventory as their sales forecast weaken. With the impact of a $50 million decline in rug purchases, the segment's sales would have increased approximately 6.5% versus prior year.\nIn July, we closed the acquisition of Foss Floors, a leading nonwoven flooring manufacturer, for approximately $150 million. Foss adds a new product category to our portfolio that complements our existing lines and includes needle punch, rugs, carpet, DIY tile and artificial turf. Foss' 2022 sales have been strong with a present run rate of approximately $100 million.\nTo adapt to current conditions, we are taking actions to restructure our cost across the enterprise to improve our results. We are finalizing plans to rationalize older, less efficient assets and optimize processes to lower cost. The most significant actions will be in our Flooring North America segment, including reducing some yarn assets and rug capacity.\nIn our Flooring Rest of World segment, we are consolidating insulation products and streamlining our organizations. And in Ceramic, Europe, we are simplifying administrative and manufacturing organizations. We estimate these initiatives will reduce our cost by $35 million to $40 million annually, with an estimated cash cost of $15 million to $20 million, with a total cost of $90 million to $95 million.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. During the first half of 2022, we delivered solid results despite the pressure of significant inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical instability.\nIn the U.S., rapidly rising interest rates are impacting housing sales, and inflation is causing changes in consumer discretionary spending. Residential remodeling is softening as consumers postpone upgrading their homes. New home and multifamily flooring channels remain strong, and the commercial sector continues to improve as new and deferred projects are initiated.\nThough interest rates are lower in Europe, dramatically higher natural gas prices and constrained supply are reducing economic growth. Given these factors, we anticipate softening demand and increased pressure on our margins going forward. We're taking targeted actions across the enterprise to adjust to these changing market conditions.\nMaterial and energy costs continue to rise, and we're implementing further price increases in response. We're introducing higher-value products and enhancing our service levels to expand sales. We're reducing expenses and initiating new process improvements. We'll be implementing multiple restructuring projects across the company to reduce our costs. We also expect improvements in material supply and transportation as we go through the remainder of the year.\nIn the U.S., we anticipate that rising interest rates will strengthen the dollar and reduce our translated results. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be $3.33 to $3.43, excluding any restructuring charges.\nMohawk has successfully managed through economic cycles many times before. Over the long term, flooring grows at a faster rate than the overall economy. Around the world, a deficit in housing stock requires additional construction in most regions. In the U.S., housing demand exceeds supplied by an estimated 5 million units and it will take years to satisfy. In addition, over 20 million homes are between 20 and 40 years old and in need of significant renovation.\nOur business is well positioned to benefit from the long-term growth in new home construction, residential remodeling and commercial projects. We have a strong balance sheet that supports growing the business through internal investments as well as acquisitions and stock buybacks. We will enhance the performance of our acquisitions, and we'll continue to seek opportunities in new products and geographies. We remain optimistic about Mohawk's future, and the actions we are taking today will improve our results.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

My name is Charlotte, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Mohawk Industries' First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, April 29, 2022. Thank you.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. James Brunk. Mr. Brunk, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Charlotte. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's first quarter performance and provide guidance for the second quarter.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim.\nMohawk's performance in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales in the quarter rose to an all-time record of $3 billion, up 13% as reported or approximately 17% on a constant currency and days basis. Our sales momentum continued from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher pricing, growth in our ceramic businesses, an improving commercial sector and benefit from our small acquisitions. Our operating income exceeded our forecast as strength in the global ceramic business offset rising European energy costs, improved operational efficiencies, enhanced Flooring North America's results and our management of European market pressures benefited Flooring Rest of the World.\nDuring the quarter, we ran our operations at high levels in most markets to address order backlogs and replenish inventory. During the past year, rapid cost escalations have required multiple pricing actions to pass through. We've implemented these unprecedented increases across our markets and have also announced additional increases across the businesses as inflation continues to rise. We're also controlling SG&A spending, enhancing operational efficiencies and introducing new features.\nLabor shortages persist, requiring enhanced training programs and process improvements to minimize impacts. Supply chain issues continued through the quarter, impacting specific products and markets. We manage material shortages by re-engineering products, streamlining our SKUs and improving production planning.\nMarket conditions for flooring remain favorable, even as governments raise interest rates to combat inflation. Employment is at high levels and wages are increasing in most of our markets. Millions of millennials in their late 20s and early 30s are forming households and desire homeownership.\nUnlike past cycles, U.S. home housing inventory is historically low. More single-family homes are under construction, and the home deficit will take years to align supply with demand. New residential construction will continue at high levels and delayed 2021 home construction will increase flooring purchases this year. Remodeling should remain strong, supported by rising home equity and buyers of existing homes completing long-term projects they've initiated over the past few years.\nAging housing stock and changing needs of those working from home also expand property updates. We continue to introduce differentiated products that inspire remodeling projects as families customize recently acquired homes.\nCommercial new construction and remodeling continues to strengthen as business conditions improve and projects that were delayed due to COVID are initiated. Our commercial products create inviting environments for businesses, and we are deploying appealing new collections to capture pent-up commercial demand. In some markets, our growth in the quarter was limited by inventory and production constraints.\nWe are executing multiple expansion projects so that we can satisfy demand for our higher growth products, create innovative new features and improve operational efficiencies. The categories that we are expanding include U.S. laminate, LVT and quartz countertops; European laminate, high-end porcelain slabs and specialty products; and ceramic tile in Brazil and Mexico.\nOur recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are enhancing our growing insulation and panels businesses. Sales of products remained strong and our design and features we're bringing to the market give us competitive advantages in all price points.\nAgainst the background of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, Mohawk has continued to deliver sales growth, generate strong cash flow and maintain historically low leverage.\nGiven the undervaluation of our stock relative to our earnings, our Board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program in February. We acquired 2.1 million shares during the first quarter for a total of $307 million. Since the start of 2020, we've acquired 8.5 million shares, representing 12% of the outstanding balance, reflecting our confidence in Mohawk's long-term growth and profitability. Our strong balance sheet provides many alternatives for investments, including product extensions, geographic expansion, acquisitions and further stock buybacks. Since becoming a public company, Mohawk has completed many transformational and bolt-on acquisitions, and we continue to explore additional options.\nFinally, I'm pleased that Jerry Burris has joined our Board of Directors. Jerry is the President and CEO of Midwest Can Company, and he brings unique strengths in business strategy and operations to our Board.\nNow Jim will cover our first quarter financial results in more detail.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff.\nSales for the quarter were just over $3 billion. That's a 13% increase as reported and 17% on a constant basis, being an all-time quarterly record. The year-over-year increase in sales was primarily driven by pricing actions in response to significant global inflation and volume growth in a number of our product categories compared to a strong unit expansion in Q1 of 2021.\nGross margin for the quarter was 26.6% versus the prior year of 30.1%, excluding charges. On an absolute dollar basis, gross earnings was flat versus prior year as pricing actions and productivity countered increased inflation, offset by FX headwinds, higher temporary shutdowns due to material supply shortages and limited unit volume growth. The actual detail amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A of our 10-Q, which will be filed after this call.\nSG&A, as reported, was 16% of sales versus 17.7% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A dollars was due to the impact of product mix, inflation and volume, partially offset by increased productivity and the impact of FX.\nOperating income, as reported, was $321 million. Excluding charges was $323 million or 10.7% compared to 12.3% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income on a constant FX basis was $334 million compared to $329 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was a result of strong pricing actions and increased productivity offsetting the higher inflation, negatively impacted by lower overall volume dollars and higher temporary shutdowns due to material shortages.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $11 million. The year-over-year decrease of approximately $4 million was mainly due to the settlement of our 2022 2% Eurobond in Q4 of 2021. Other income, other expense was an expense of $3 million.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%, and we expect the full year tax rate to be between 22% and 23% with possible quarterly variations. That leads us to an earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis of $3.78. That's an increase of 13% versus the prior year on a GAAP basis and 8% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just under $1.1 billion. That's an increase of 14.5% as reported or approximately 18.5% on a constant basis. The year-over-year increase in sales was primarily a result of segment-wide pricing actions with the strongest volume increase in Europe, Mexico and with our U.S. quartz countertop business.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 9.4% versus 9.6% in the prior year. And adjusted operating income on a constant basis was $103 million compared to $89 million last year. The year-over-year increase is due to pricing actions combined with productivity to offset inflation, even with the European energy crisis, in addition to favorable year-over-year volume.\nFlooring North America had sales also just shy of $1.1 billion. That's a 10.6% increase as reported or 12.3% on a constant basis. The year-over-year sales growth is due to aggressive pricing actions and volume strength in resilient, laminate and the commercial business units, offset by softness in residential carpet.\nOperating margin, excluding charges, was 8.9% versus 9.3% in the prior year, and operating income was $95 million compared to $90 million last year. The segment increase in operating income dollars was due to pricing actions and increased productivity initiatives offsetting inflation, which was due primarily to rising material costs, lower overall volume and shutdown costs caused by material shortages.\nAnd finally, in Flooring Rest of the World, sales were $879 million. That's an increase of 14.2% as reported or 22% on a constant basis, driven by strong pricing actions across the segment and volume growth in laminate, panels and installation businesses.\nThe operating margin, excluding charges, was 15.5%, but a decrease from our 20.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income on a constant basis was $145 million compared to $161 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was driven by significant inflation, primarily offset by pricing actions in addition to unfavorable productivity and temporary shutdowns due to material shortages and material substitution. Corporate and eliminations was $10 million this year, in line with prior year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments was $541 million, with free cash flow being a use of cash of $75 million in the quarter with a return to normal seasonality. Full year cash flow is projected to approach prior year.\nReceivables for the quarter were just over $2 billion with a DSO of 53.8 days, slightly down from the 54.4 days in the prior year. Inventories were just over $2.5 billion. That's an increase of $517 million or 26% from the prior year with approximately 60% due to inflation and 40% due to unit growth. Inventory days were at 110.5 versus 105.6 in the prior year.\nProperty, plant and equipment was just over $4.5 billion, with CapEx for the quarter at $129 million versus a D&A of $141 million. Full year CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $800 million, with D&A forecasted at $570 million. And finally, the balance sheet and free cash flow for the full year remain very strong with gross debt currently at $2.6 billion and leverage at 1.1x adjusted EBITDA.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for a review of our key operational areas.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim.\nOur U.S. ceramic business continues to improve its sales and margins. We are enhancing our product mix and implementing multiple price increases to cover inflation. During the quarter, the residential sector remained strong while the commercial sector gained momentum as businesses initiated new projects and commenced deferred remodeling. Our sales should be positively impacted by providing alternatives to tile imports, which are increasing in price and experiencing shipping delays. We have enhanced our technology tools to make product selection, ordering and pick up the fastest and easiest in the industry. Our quartz countertop sales are growing rapidly and to satisfy demand, we have initiated construction to expand capacity at our Tennessee countertop facility. We see our position in the U.S. ceramic market improving with new construction at high levels and strengthening commercial channels as we provide domestically produced options with outstanding visuals and features.\nThe results of our ceramic business in Mexico and Brazil continue to be strong, even with our sales in the quarter being limited by low inventory levels. Our performance was supported by ongoing strength in residential construction and remodeling with commercial projects improving. During the past year, we have responded to rising inflation and higher energy cost with multiple price increases, which both markets have accepted. We will continue to take pricing actions as inflation rises. Near term, we see strength in both markets continuing though increasing interest rates and inflation may impact future demand. To relieve constraints, we have increased capacity in Mexico, and we are negotiating with government agencies for permits and incentives to construct a new porcelain facility in Brazil.\nIn our European ceramic business, our management team is taking extraordinary steps to adapt to a uniquely challenging environment. Our sales in the first quarter grew as consumer demand strengthened and our customers increased inventory levels in anticipation of inflation. The ceramic industry production in Europe was interrupted when Ukrainian clay supplies to Western Europe ceased. Natural gas prices for the balance of the year have escalated from prior estimates, raising our future cost.\nWe improved the results by increasing prices more than we expected, and we enhanced our product mix to improve our results. We anticipated the Ukrainian clay problems and increased our inventory levels before the invasion to avoid interrupting our production. Our clay inventory should provide sufficient time to reformulate products with alternative materials without disrupting our operations. There is more market uncertainty in the second half of 2022 with economic growth expected to slow and energy costs higher than earlier estimates. We are prepared to adjust our strategies as necessary based on market conditions.\nThe Flooring Rest of the World segment delivered solid top line growth as demand remains strong. Our management team took actions to manage rising energy costs, escalating material inflation and volatile supply chains. Despite multiple price increases, we are lagging rapidly rising cost in Europe and have announced additional price increases in response to continuing inflationary pressures. Our continuous innovation and new features supports our market position and margins.\nDue to their unique visuals and water-resistant performance, demand for our premium laminate collections remain strong. Though material supply in the quarter limited production, our laminate sales increased and we expected continued long-term growth as we expand the premium laminate category with new innovation and design and features.\nTo maximize our distribution in laminate, we introduced our leading-edge innovations in the specialty channel under our Quick-Step brand and follow them up in other channels with premium features that add value utilizing unique brands. With this market strategy for our laminate, we are expanding our market share and adding new capacity to support in Belgium by the end of 2023.\nSales in our LVT and sheet vinyl business were negatively impacted by material disruptions and low inventory levels. Our margins improved through the period driven by increased production and prices. Raw material supply for both categories was especially challenging, but improved as we went through the period. We are continuing to enhance our LVT processes and formulations to improve our sales and margins. Our rigid LVT sales are growing substantially as the category increases in consumer preference.\nOur 2 bolt-on acquisitions contributed to our top line during the quarter, and the integration of both is proceeding as planned. Our purchase of an insulation manufacturer with plants in Ireland and the U.K. increased our market share and sales of polyurethane insulation products. In one of the installation plants we acquired, a new production line with state-of-the-art technology is presently starting up.\nOur new French MDF facility has enhanced our product offering and extended the geographic reach of our business. We will enhance the plant's operations by improving processes, expanding capacity and generating energy from waste wood. Despite material constraints, our panel sales grew significantly in the quarter, including strong results in our mezzanine business, which is expanding with e-commerce demand. Our new high-pressure laminate line is performing well and extending our manufacturing into a new product category that coordinates with other wood panels. To deliver more sustainable panel products, we have introduced a new patented technology for reclaiming wood fiber from MDF boards that will reduce carbon emissions and our cost position. Our 2 energy plants fueled with waste wood lower our carbon emissions and significantly reduce our energy cost.\nOur Australian business had robust demand for flooring in the quarter following the loosening of COVID restrictions, while New Zealand remained difficult due to continued COVID restrictions. Price increases have been implemented in both countries in response to rising material and transportation costs.\nAs in Flooring Rest of World, Flooring North America is managing the greatest inflation we have ever experienced. The strategies we have been implementing during the past 2 years have improved our sales execution, cost structure and service levels and enabled us to manage a difficult environment.\nMost of our manufacturing costs are related to oil and gas prices and our suppliers continue to increase their margins given supply constraints. To offset, we have announced new price increases this year in addition to the multiple rounds of increases in 2021. Across the segment, we have initiated many projects to increase productivity, improve efficiencies and upgrade our assets to enhance our results.\nMohawk holds a leading share of the North American laminate market and sales of our premium collections continued to grow in the quarter as our new production line ramped up. We anticipate achieving our targeted production levels as planned during the second quarter, which will expand the sales of our next-generation products.\nWith realistic visuals and superior performance, our laminate has become an appealing waterproof alternative to both wood and LVT in most channels, including new home construction. Escalating market demand in North America is absorbing our additional production as it comes online, and we are further expanding our U.S. laminate capacity next year to support continued growth.\nOur LVT sales continued to grow substantially in the first quarter as we benefited from an improved offering across all channels. Our margins were impacted by material disruptions that interrupted manufacturing, delays in sourced products and higher ocean freight costs. Our legacy LVT operation has significantly improved its processes and is increasing line speeds and capacity.\nOur new West Coast LVT facility is initiating production and fine-tuning processes. When fully implemented, our East and West Coast operations will provide logistics and service advantages to our customers. We will continue to strategically utilize sourced LVT to round out our portfolio and maximize our business.\nOur sheet vinyl sales also increased, though material shortages stopped our operations and raised our cost in the period. We anticipate material supply for our resilient business normalizing during the second quarter, which will improve our sales and margins.\nResidential carpet service improved substantially and customers are lowering inventory, impacting sales. We are raising prices further to offset escalating material and energy costs. By reducing complexity, simplifying operations and increasing efficiencies, we are improving costs. We are managing tight labor markets that are impacting staffing and productivity.\nOur commercial sales continue to rebound led by strength in the government, workplace and health care channels. Sales in both our carpet tile and commercial LVT collections are growing as new and deferred projects are being initiated. Commercial design activity continues to strengthen as reflected by the March Architectural Billing Index. This project pipeline will support future specification and sales growth of our commercial products.\nOur domestically produced LVT is being more widely specified due to its greater dimensional stability, superior performance and preference for more consistent local supply. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral with our commercial flooring products and have introduced a new carpet tile that provides superior acoustics and comfort while achieving the highest level of sustainability certifications with half the carbon footprint.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris.\nFour months into 2022, we remain cautiously optimistic about industry growth this year despite inflation and interest rate pressures. We've announced additional price increases in most of our products and markets as inflation continues to rise. Housing supply is historically low and rising mortgage rates are spurring families to purchase homes sooner. Remodeling should be supported by continued existing home sales, higher home equity and the upgrading of homes purchased over the past 2 to 3 years.\nWe anticipate the commercial sector will continue its rebound with people returning to pre-pandemic routines. We expect improvements in the supply of constrained materials which should increase our production levels.\nOur capital investments when completed will relieve specific capacity constraints and increase our offering. This year, we are focused on optimizing our mix and margins by limiting the impact of inflation through price increases, controlling our spending and initiating additional productivity actions, which should increase in our year-over-year earnings per share.\nGiven these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be $4.25 to $4.35, excluding any restructuring charges. We have confidence in the long-term future of our business despite near-term uncertainties. Globally, there is a structural deficit for housing that will take years to satisfy and we should benefit from strong long-term trends in new home construction, residential remodeling and commercial projects.\nOur brands are the most recognized in flooring and provide a comprehensive product portfolio that includes the industry's strongest collection of sustainable products. We are making it easier for our customers to grow their business through leading digital tools that generate customer leads, simplify ordering and expedite deliveries.\nThrough the innovation of our talented team, we continue to lead the industry in design, performance and value. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue both transformational and bolt-on acquisitions that complement our business. Over the next 3 to 5 years, these advantages should enhance Mohawk's sales and margin expansion.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

My name is Laurie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, February 11, 2022. Thank you.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. James Brunk. Mr. Brunk, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries quarterly investor conference call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's fourth quarter and full year results.\nI'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. For the full year, Mohawk's business improved significantly. In 2021, net sales grew more than 17% as reported versus the prior year to $11.2 billion, and our operating margins rose dramatically to approximately 12%. Our 2021 adjusted operating income approached $1.4 billion with adjusted EBITDA exceeding $1.9 billion. In addition, versus our 2019 prepandemic results, we also achieved 12% organic sales growth and improved our adjusted margins by 270 basis points.\nWe ended the year with a historically strong balance sheet. And during the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 2.4 million additional shares of stock for a total of approximately 4.9 million shares purchased during the full year. In February, the Board of Directors approved an additional authorization for share repurchases of $500 million based on our confidence in the company's strength and to enhance shareholder return.\nAll of our segments performed well and responded effectively to the complexities that occurred during the year. Throughout '21, our regions benefited from strong housing markets supported by rising home prices, favorable interest rates and accelerated home purchases by millennial. Changing lifestyles encourage shift from rental to owned property, movement to larger homes and remodeling upgrades to adapt to work and school at home.\nAmong home improvement projects, new flooring is one of the most frequent upgrades. All of our product categories have benefited from this trend, which is projected to continue throughout 2022.\nThe commercial sector continued its improvement over the prior year, but has not yet reached prepandemic levels. While we thought COVID would be behind us in 2021, the pandemic continued to impact our markets to varying degrees throughout the year. Surges in some countries kept people voluntarily at home, and government restrictions in other regions temporarily hindered our operations and customers. We continue to maintain precautions in our facilities to mitigate risk to our employees.\nMoving forward, we will benefit from bolt-on acquisitions we completed in '21. These include an MDF manufacture in France and an Irish installation company, which will be accretive to earnings in 2022. When integrated, they will enhance our present operations, expand our markets and reduce our costs.\nOur performance in 2021 illustrated the fundamental strength of our business as we maximize our results and strong market conditions as well as those where the pandemic impacted our industry. We delivered product innovation around the world, leveraged our logistics strength as a competitive advantage and executed multiple price increases to pass through material, energy and transportation inflation across all products and geographies.\nWe managed labor shortages with enhanced training, process improvements and strategic automation where possible. We creatively addressed material supply shortages through product reengineering, SKU rationalization and improved production planning. The negative impact from inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, along with a stronger U.S. dollar, increased as the year progressed.\nSales in the fourth quarter remained strong, rising 4.5% as reported or approximately 12% on a constant currency and days basis to approximately $2.8 billion, with a return to more normal seasonality for the industry and 6% fewer days in the period compared to the prior year. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.95 per share with benefits from price mix and productivity, offset by increased inflation and lower volume from fewer days in the period.\nAs raw material, energy and other costs continue to rise, we implemented price increases in most products during the quarter. European natural gas prices have been the most volatile, substantially increasing our energy costs as well as material costs, and we have raised our selling prices significantly. We ran our operations at high levels through the end of the year in an effort to improve inventory, though staffing, material supply and transportation challenges impacted our costs.\nOutside the U.S., government restrictions on business operations in some regions lowered retail sales during the quarter. Commercial sales improved in the quarter even with some deferral of projects due to COVID and government actions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we released our annual environmental sustainability and governance report. The report showcases how Mohawk is fostering innovative products that lay the foundation for healthier, more inspiring spaces where people live and work. We also highlight how we are maintaining a safe, respectful workplace, reducing and repurposing waste and conserving natural resources. The entire document is available on our website.\nJim will now review our fourth quarter and full year financials.\n\nJames F. Brunk\n\nCFO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just shy of $2.8 billion. That's a 4.5% increase as reported or 11.8% on a constant days and FX basis, setting a new fourth quarter record. Year-over-year, growth was driven by price/mix initiatives across the business to attack rising costs, partially offset by the fewer shipping days and a more normal seasonality.\nFor the full year, Mohawk also set sales record on a consolidated basis and in each segment, with total sales of $11.2 billion, a 17% increase versus prior year as reported. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.7% as reported or 26.8% excluding charges, decreasing from 28.8% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by inflation of $257 million, lower volume of $49 million with fewer shipping days and a more normal seasonality, partially offset by improved price/mix of $242 million and productivity gains of $40 million.\nSG&A as reported was 17.5%. On an absolute dollar basis, the increase versus prior year is a result of a return to a more normal selling and marketing activity compared to the prior year of $19 million, inflation of $7 million, unfavorable impact of price/mix and volume of $5 million, partially offset by a net FX gain of $5 million. Operating income as reported was a margin of 9.2% and excluding charges 9.4% compared to 11.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was driven by inflation of $264 million, especially in raw material and energy, unfavorable volume of $51 million primarily due to the fewer shipping days, partially offset by strong price/mix actions of $240 million, productivity gains of $21 million and a net FX gain of $8 million.\nOn a full year basis, adjusted operating margin of 12.1% significantly increased, exceeding prior year by 370 basis points and 2019 by 270 basis points driven by strong volume, productivity and price/mix actions offsetting increase inflation. Interest expense for the quarter was $12 million, down slightly from prior year. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.9% versus 14.8% in the prior year, which was favorably impacted by the CARES Act. We expect 2022's tax rate to be between 22% and 23% with quarterly variations.\nOur EPS as reported was $2.80 and on an adjusted basis was $2.95, a decrease of 17% primarily due to the volume effect of fewer shipping days and the pace of inflation, especially in Europe. On a full year basis, EPS of $14.86 was an all-time record, increasing 68% versus prior year and 48% versus 2019's prepandemic level.\nNow turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $950 million for the quarter, a 3.2% increase as reported or 9.8% on a constant FX and days basis. The year-over-year sales growth is driven by pricing actions with Brazil, Europe, Mexico and our U.S. countertop business showing the strongest growth. Operating margins excluding charges was 6.4% compared to 9.5% in the prior year. The segment has been impacted by the ongoing energy crisis in Europe with total inflation increasing by $87 million versus prior year as well as the fewer shipping days driving lower volume of $13 million, partially offset by strong price/mix actions of $65 million, favorable productivity of $7 million and net FX gain of $2 million.\nFlooring North America had sales of just over $1 billion. That's a 5.4% increase as reported or 12.2% on a constant basis, with the resilient and laminate product categories having the strongest results, along with our commercial business, which continues to show improvement. Operating margin excluding charges was 9.1% as compared to 9.5% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin decrease was driven by inflation of $88 million primarily due to raw materials, offset by continued price/mix actions of $85 million; a decrease in volume primarily due to fewer shipping days of $20 million, offset by increased productivity initiatives of $22 million; and less temporary shutdowns of $4 million.\nAnd finally, Flooring Rest of the World had sales of $796 million. That's a 4.9% increase as reported or 13.9% on a constant days and FX basis, with the strongest growth in our panels and insulation business as LVT and laminate were negatively impacted by supply and labor constraints. Operating margins excluding charges came in at 14.8% as compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year margin decrease is due to unfavorable volume of $18 million driven by fewer shipping days and labor and material constraints, which also negatively impacted productivity by $8 million.\nIn addition, we have seen escalating inflation of $89 million in the fourth quarter but were able to offset with price/mix actions of $90 million. Lastly, there was a slight increase in start-up costs of $2 million offset by net FX gains of $6 million. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and eliminations were $12 million, in line with the prior year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments were $592 million. Now due to the increase in inventory and the timing of CapEx, we recorded a use of cash in the quarter of $89 million but had a strong full year free cash flow of $633 million. Receivables ended the year at just over $1.8 billion, and DSOs were very strong at 56 days as compared to 59 in the prior year.\nInventories were just shy of $2.4 billion. That's an increase of approximately $479 million or 25% from the prior year due primarily to increasing inflation. Inventory days finished at 112 days versus 103 in the prior year. Property, plant and equipment was just over $4.6 billion. Now based on the timing of our new projects, CapEx for the quarter was $301 million with D&A of $143 million. For the full year, CapEx came in at $676 million and D&A at $592 million.\nFor 2022, we are forecasting CapEx to be approximately $800 million and D&A to be approximately $600 million. Now overall, the balance sheet and ongoing cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of just over $2.3 billion and a leverage at 0.9x to adjusted EBITDA.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Chris to review our operations.\n\nWilliam Christopher Wellborn\n\nPresident, COO & Director, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales increased 5% as reported or approximately 14% on a constant days and currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was 14.8% as a result of pricing and mix gains offset by inflation and lower volume due to fewer shipping days and supply chain interruptions during the quarter. Sales were strong in the quarter as demand for our residential products maintained its momentum even with delays in shipments due to transportation constraints.\nBeginning in the third quarter, our material costs began escalating at an unpredictable pace as many suppliers utilize natural gas in their manufacturing process. Based on our cost estimates, we raised prices on our product lines in the fourth quarter and again in the beginning of this year. Despite multiple pricing actions, we are still lagging inflation because of these increases. We have announced further price increases based on current costs, and it will take time for our actions to offset these extraordinary circumstances. We will continue to monitor closely, and we'll take further actions as required.\nDuring the quarter, our premium laminate collections continued to perform well in Europe and Russia due to our unique visuals and water-resistant technologies. Though we expected improved material availability for our LVT business, we continue to experience shortages, which impacted our production and sales in the quarter. We are continuing to enhance our LVT processes, particularly in our higher-value rigid collections. As we expand our customer base and product offering, we are growing our sheet vinyl sales in Russia and Europe.\nWe installed a new production line for high-pressure laminate, which is sold as a complementary product to our panels and is used on surfaces that require higher performance levels such as furniture, cabinetry and wall treatments. We are enhancing our panel visuals with new technologies from our laminate flooring. Our mezzanine flooring business also grew significantly in the period as demand for e-commerce warehouses space expanded.\nThroughout 2022, we will integrate the bolt-on acquisitions we completed last year to expand our position and further differentiate Mohawk from our competition. Our new French MDF facility will complement our existing operations, enhance our product offering and strengthen our regional position. The purchase of an insulation manufacturer with plants in Ireland and the U.K. complements our existing operations in those countries and will increase our share in the polyurethane insulation category. The purchase of a wood veneer producer to be finalized in the first quarter will improve the cost and quality of our engineered wood floors and make our operations more sustainable. To enhance these operations, we will upgrade their assets and refine their processes.\nOur Rest of World segment has a proven foundation for growth based on delivering product innovation through value-added features that consumers prefer. The unique style and performance of our premium laminate has made us the market leader. Our waterproof laminate collections are popular across all sales channels, and we have seen growing demand as home renovation has increased during the pandemic. To maximize our premium laminate sales, we expanded our press capacity last year. We are executing our next laminate expansion in Belgium, which will support additional sales of approximately $150 million when the production is fully operational at the end of 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales increased 3% as reported and 10% on a constant days and currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was 6% as a result of productivity and pricing and mix improvements, offset by European energy crisis, inflation and a return to more normal seasonality. Mexico, Brazil and Russia outperformed in the period even though sales in those regions were constrained by capacity limitations.\nOur U.S. ceramic products are gaining momentum as imported ceramic service levels have become less reliable and landed costs have increased. Residential remodeling and new construction drove sales growth in the quarter with commercial improving though still below prepandemic levels.\nWe grew sales and improved mix with our innovative floor, wall and mosaic offerings as well as expanding our position in exterior products such as our outdoor porcelain papers. We have introduced a variety of new sizes and unique shapes and expanded our polished and rectify collections with enhanced performance features. Our courts and porcelain slab sales continue to grow, improving our mix and margins. Inflation in material, labor and energy continue to impact all of our markets, and we are taking additional pricing actions to recover.\nLast year, in Europe, natural gas prices accelerated at an unprecedented pace due to supply shortages and are presently about 5 to 6x higher than last year. Most European ceramic industry participants are implementing price increases to offset these extraordinarily high energy costs. We anticipate our prices aligning in the second half of the year. Due to uncertain availability this winter, we are forecasting continued energy volatility, which will impact our first quarter results. Future prices will depend on stability in the region and whether Russia increases supplies beyond its contractual obligations.\nMohawk is the world's largest producer of ceramic tile, and we have many opportunities to leverage that position and grow our long-term sales and profits. We are well positioned for significant growth in markets such as Russia, Brazil and Mexico, where ceramic tile is the dominant residential and commercial flooring. In Russia, we are expanding our porcelain tile capacity with a new production line that should be operational later this year and an additional line that will be completed in 2023.\nIn Brazil, we are constructing a new porcelain tile facility that should be operating fully by the end of next year. In Mexico, we are expanding our production of mosaics and specialty products while allocating more of our ceramic production to the local market. In Europe, we're adding capacity to expand our porcelain slab business and enhance our successful outdoor and specialty tile business. In the U.S., we are investing in our quartz countertop production to keep pace with rapidly increasing demand. Collectively, these expansions will support additional sales of approximately $300 million when all of the lines are fully operational.\nThis year is the 20th anniversary of Mohawk's entry into ceramic tile manufacturing through the acquisition of Daltile. In the past 2 decades, we have grown our legacy sales and expanded into new markets through major acquisitions. Ceramic tile is the primary flooring in many large markets where industry consolidation has not yet taken place, providing significant opportunities for expansion.\nIn the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales increased 5% as reported or 12% on a constant basis, and operating margin was 9% as a result of productivity, pricing and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation and a return to normal seasonality. The robust U.S. housing market supported sales growth with both remodeling and new construction remaining strong, particularly in the Sun Belt. The success of our differentiated products benefited our mix, though some consumers traded down to maintain their budgets.\nThe commercial sector continued to slowly improve, with COVID concerns still deferring some projects. In the period, we increased prices due to higher energy and material inflation. We improved our service levels, though our production costs increased with greater energy expenses, absenteeism and training of new hires. Some product manufacturing was constrained by raw material shortages, limiting operations and increasing costs.\nWe are expanding our manufacturing capacity in LVT, laminate, commercial, carpet tile and floor mats to increase our sales. We expect continued improvement in the residential markets for the foreseeable future. Commercial will continue to recover as business confidence grows and new projects are initiated.\nMohawk is the leader in U.S. laminate market, and we have reinvigorated the product category with improved visuals and waterproof performance. All sales channels are expanding the use of our premium laminate, and we are increasing our capacity to support $300 million of additional sales. The first expansion phase is starting up this quarter with the second phase following in 2023. The new production lines will have capabilities to produce the next generation of proprietary laminate to extend our leadership in the category.\nLVT remains the fastest-growing floor product in the market, and our LVT business delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter as we continue to improve production at our existing facility. We are starting up a new LVT operation to support sales of over $160 million. The plant's first equipment is being installed now, and the project will be completed in phases through the second half of 2023. Once all planned lines are fully operational, the site can be expanded further as needed.\nTo provide more value to our customers, we are incorporating unique technical features utilizing proprietary technology developed for our laminate business. In addition to these capacity increases, we also have many cost-saving investments, including fiber manufacturing and transportation projects that will improve productivity and profitability within the segment.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Lorberbaum\n\nChairman & CEO, Mohawk Industries, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. After a record-setting 2021, we're enthusiastic about Mohawk's future growth and profitability. This year, GDP is expected to grow 3% to 5% in most of our markets with residential sales remaining strong and commercial improvement. Interest rates will likely rise but should remain historically favorable and support continued home sales and remodel. During the year, we anticipate inflation moderating and constraints in labor, material and energy declining. We're selling all of our capacity in many product categories and are optimizing our mix and margins this year. We've initiated multiple expansion projects to increase our sales in this growing area this year and beyond.\nSignificantly -- significant short-term material, energy and transportation inflation is affecting all of our businesses, and we are reengineering formulations, reducing spending and improving efficiencies to offset. We're presently implementing price increases, have announced additional ones across products and geography. We will continue to adjust our pricing as necessary to recover our margins over time.\nIn Europe, energy costs have dramatically accelerated and have also affected the cost of our materials. Our European ceramic business has been the most impacted, which we anticipate will create a $40 million to $45 million headwind net of price increases in the first quarter. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.90 to $3, excluding any restructuring charges. In the second half, we expect our margins to improve as capacity expands, inflation moderates and pricing aligns.\nBased on the strength of our company, our product and geographic diversity, investments in growing categories and potential acquisitions, our long-range outlook is for higher sales growth and margin expansion. Flooring is an essential part of new construction remodeling and as the world's largest flooring manufacturer, Mohawk has built leading positions in major flooring markets around the globe. We expect our business to benefit from strong demand through this economic cycle.\nGiven today's low inventory of existing homes, new residential construction and remodeling should remain strong for many years. Mohawk's sustainable products appeal to today's environmentally conscious end users, which gives us an added advantage in our markets and enhances our bottom line. In time, we expect the commercial sector to return to its historical growth, with pent-up demand representing a significant opportunity.\nIn addition to expanding capacity, we continue to invest in our organization's talent and state-of-the-art technology to deliver exceptional design, value and service to our customers. Over the next 3 years, we anticipate higher sales and margins as we implement our product, manufacturing and marketing initiatives. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to pursue acquisitions that further our geographic reach and product offering while growing our sales and profitability.\nWe'll now be glad to take your questions."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com we will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2.\nStatements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.\nJoining me on today's call are David Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid S. Regnery\n\nEVP of Climate & Industrial Segments, Ingersoll-Rand Plc\n\nThanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining today's call. Please turn to Slide #3.\nI'd like to open the call with a few thoughts on our purpose-driven strategy that fuels our strong performance over time. The demand for sustainable resilient infrastructure has never been greater. That's especially true here in the U.S., where the AI revolution and reshoring of industry are transforming how businesses operate at an unprecedented pace.\nTrane Technologies is at the heart of this evolution, helping customers reimagine their operations for greater performance and sustainability. Our high-efficiency solutions help our customers save energy and reduce operational costs. We're proving that there is no trade-off. That's good for the environment, is good for the bottom line.\nAs we look ahead, our innovation and expertise continue to set us apart. With our elevated backlog, robust customer demand and strong financial performance we are well positioned to continue to deliver long-term value to our employees, customers, shareholders and the planet. Please turn to Slide #4.\nQ3 was another strong quarter marked by record quarterly bookings of $6 billion, representing organic growth of 13% year-over-year. We delivered 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 15% adjusted EPS growth and robust free cash flow.\nOur global commercial HVAC businesses delivered outstanding performance. This was particularly true in the Americas where commercial HVAC bookings reached an all-time high, surging 30% year-over-year, with applied bookings more than doubling. The strength of our commercial HVAC business is further underscored by our Q3 ending backlog of $7.2 billion. However, this total backlog figure does not tell the whole story.\nCompared to year-end 2024, our Americas and EMEA commercial HVAC backlog has grown substantially, increasing by over $800 million or approximately 15%. Excluding residential, revenue growth remains robust, up approximately 10% in the third quarter. We are well positioned for growth in 2026, given strong execution through our business operating system and our rapidly expanding pipeline of projects in data centers and core verticals.\nOur leading innovation and direct sales force provide us with distinct competitive advantages. Our services business, which constitutes approximately 1/3 of our total enterprise revenues remains a durable and consistent growth driver, up low double digits year-to-date and boasting a low-teens compound annual growth rate since 2020. Our guidance reflects the impact discussed during our September update, which Chris will elaborate on shortly.\nPlease turn to Slide #5. As discussed in our Americas segment, commercial HVAC continues to deliver standout performance. The team achieved its third consecutive quarter of record-breaking bookings with approximately 30% growth. We are winning in both core vertical markets and high-growth verticals such as data centers. In high-growth verticals, customers demand innovative, highly engineered solutions tailored to their specific requirements. They need customer-focused partners with the expertise and capacity to grow alongside them, which plays to our strengths.\nOur direct sales strategy enables us to capture a significant share of these opportunities and consistently outgrow our end markets. This is demonstrated by our Applied Solutions bookings growth of over 100% in the third quarter. Commercial and HVAC revenue growth was also robust, increasing by low teens in equipment and low double digits in services. Our consistent market outgrowth compounds revenues year after year for perspective. In the third quarter, our applied revenue growth on a 3-year stack was up more than 125%.\nTurning to residential. Bookings and revenues declined approximately 30% and 20%, respectively, consistent with the update we provided in September. In Americas, transport refrigeration, bookings were up low teens, while revenues were flat despite end markets being down over 25%, we continue to outperform.\nCommercial HVAC strength was not limited to the Americas. In EMEA, commercial HVAC bookings increased by high teens, while revenues grew by mid-single digits, consistent with our expectations. EMEA transport bookings rose by high single digits, while revenues declined by low single digits, outperforming end markets, which were down mid-single digits.\nIn Asia Pacific, Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-30s, while revenues grew low teens in the quarter. Growth was strongest in China, rebounding from the anniversary of our credit tightening policy in the prior year. The rest of Asia delivered solid performance. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChristopher J. Kuehn\n\nVP & CAO, Ingersoll-Rand Plc\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. Dave covered many key points from this slide earlier, so I'll keep my comments brief. Our organic revenue growth of 4% aligns with our September update, where we shared our expectations for a $100 million revenue shortfall from our July guidance related to softer residential markets.\nDespite the challenging residential markets, we achieved strong margin expansion and EPS growth, driven by robust growth in our commercial HVAC and services businesses, strong productivity levels, and prudent cost controls implemented early in the third quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide #7. In the Americas, we delivered 4% organic revenue growth, driven by strong volume growth in our commercial HVAC business and positive price realization, offset by a significant volume decline in our residential business. Adjusted EBITDA margins rose by 90 basis points to over 23%, supported by strong productivity and prudent cost management.\nWe also sustained high levels of business reinvestment. In EMEA, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, primarily from volume growth in our commercial HVAC and transport businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margins declined by 60 basis points as expected, mainly due to year 1 M&A-related integration costs and improved sequentially from the second quarter.\nWe have intensified channel investments and M&A this year to support growth and future opportunities, which are impacting near-term margins but strengthening our business for the long term. We also maintained high levels of business reinvestment. In Asia Pacific, organic revenue increased 9% due to strong volume growth and price realization. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 230 basis points, driven by strong volume growth in China and productivity across the segment. We also sustained high levels of business reinvestment. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid S. Regnery\n\nEVP of Climate & Industrial Segments, Ingersoll-Rand Plc\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. 2025 is unfolding as expected for most of our businesses with the residential market slowdown being the most significant change impacting our outlook. Our commercial HVAC businesses globally are performing well, meeting or exceeding our expectations for the full year. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business is executing at a very high level, significantly outperforming end markets.\nAs mentioned earlier, both bookings and revenues are compounding at a high rate. especially in Applied Solutions. Our Americas commercial HVAC results are remarkably consistent with 3-year stack revenue growth of approximately 50% achieved in Q1 through Q3 of 2025 and expected for Q4 as well. Our residential business outlook remains unchanged from our September update with Q3 and expectations for Q4 revenue to be down approximately 20% each. Compared to our July guidance, the combined revenue impact is a reduction of approximately $250 million, with $100 million in Q3 and $150 million in Q4 as channel inventory continues to normalize.\nTurning to the Americas transport market. As forecast for 2025 has softened incrementally with the fourth quarter taking the brunt of the impact now down more than 30%. Despite this, we expect to outperform in Q4, with revenues expected to be down approximately 10%. Our outlook for EMEA and Asia remain unchanged. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChristopher J. Kuehn\n\nVP & CAO, Ingersoll-Rand Plc\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. Our revised guidance anticipates approximately 6% organic revenue growth for the year, factoring in headwinds from the residential and Transport Americas markets, as Dave mentioned earlier. In addition, our Commercial HVAC Americas business saw the timing of some customer desire delivery dates move from Q4 into 2026. Altogether, the total impact of these headwinds is approximately 2 percentage points on 2025 revenue growth.\nOur 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range is now $12.95 to $13.05 and up 15% to 16% year-over-year and incorporates the Q4 revenue headwinds previously discussed. We expect organic leverage of 30% plus in 2025 and believe we're on pace for another year of 100% or greater free cash flow conversion. For the fourth quarter, we expect approximately 3% organic revenue growth, driven by continued strong commercial HVAC growth.\nExcluding residential, organic revenue growth is expected to remain robust at approximately 7%. We're targeting organic leverage of approximately 30% in the fourth quarter which includes strong business reinvestments for future market outgrowth. Consistent with our full year adjusted EPS guidance, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85. For additional details related to our guidance, please refer to Slide #17.\nPlease turn to Slide #10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on deploying excess cash to maximize shareholder returns. First, we strengthened our core business through relentless reinvestment. Second, we maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure optionality as markets evolve. Third, we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our approach includes strategic M&A to enhance long-term returns and share repurchases when the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value.\nPlease turn to Slide #11. Year-to-date through October, we've deployed or committed approximately $2.4 billion through our balanced capital allocation strategy, including approximately $80 million to dividends, $160 million to M&A, $1.25 billion to share repurchases and $150 million to debt retirement. These figures exclude $260 million from M&A and $100 million from share repurchases made early in the year, which were included in our fiscal year 2024 capital deployment targets as discussed during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nWe have approximately $5 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization, providing us with significant share repurchase optionality. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach. Overall, our strong free cash flow, liquidity, balance sheet and substantial share repurchase authorization offer excellent capital allocation optionality as we move forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid S. Regnery\n\nEVP of Climate & Industrial Segments, Ingersoll-Rand Plc\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #13. The Americas transport refrigeration markets have been dynamic but the long-term outlook remains strong. [ ACT ] projects the trailer market to bottom in the first half of 2026 improved in the second half and grow over 20% for the full year.\nIn 2027, [ ACT ] anticipates another significant increase with growth exceeding 40%. We are navigating the down cycle effectively in outperforming end markets. We continue to invest heavily in innovation and look forward to adding another growth driver to our portfolio when the market strengthens.\nTurning to Slide #14. We expect to provide 2026 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call, but I'll discuss our early views based on current insights. We expect continued strong growth in our commercial HVAC businesses, which make up 70% of our total revenues. Our world-class direct sales and service teams give us a competitive edge, allowing us to pivot quickly across vertical markets to capture growth opportunities.\nWith the broadest and most innovative portfolio in the industry, we are relentlessly reinvesting to support a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. Our proven track record of compounding bookings and revenue growth, especially in high-growth verticals like data centers, underscores our strength as a leading climate innovator. Our commercial HVAC backlog is not only elevated but growing, up more than $800 million from year-end 2024, positioning us well for continued strong growth in 2026 and beyond.\nIn residential, which represents about 15% of our revenues, we believe over the long term that the industry remains fundamentally healthy with a GDP plus framework. We expect 2026 to be a tale of 2 halves. A challenging first half due to tough comps, followed by improvement in the second half against easier comps.\nIn our Americas transport business, accounting for about 7% of our revenues, we also foresee a tale of 2 halves, with soft markets in the first half and recovery in the second. While the recovery slope may vary, we are aligned with freight markets recovering in the second half of 2026. Our focus on innovation yields healthy pricing opportunities and our business operating system is prime to stay ahead of tariff and inflationary pressures.\nOur services business comprising about 1/3 of our enterprise revenues is a key driver underpinning our growth in 2026 and years to come. We have a proven track record of driving strong services growth. We see continued growth opportunities across our portfolio, particularly in commercial HVAC, where our large and growing installed base and increasing mix of applied solutions carry a strong higher margin services tail. Additionally, our rapidly growing connected services portfolio is seeing increased demand for digital performance optimization and demand side management for our Energy Services business excels. Overall, we are excited about the opportunities for continued growth in 2026.\nPlease turn to Slide #15. In closing, our leading innovation, elevated backlog and strong customer demand position us for strong performance in 2026 and beyond. Our uplift in culture continues to attract the best talent, powering our innovation. Our solutions offer strong returns to customers and also contribute to a sustainable world. This drives our consistent track record of performance and positions us to deliver differentiated value for shareholders over the long term. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?",

My name is Regina, and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit your questions to one and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and everyone for joining today's call. Please turn to slide number three. I'd like to begin with a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our leading financial results. The global demand for energy is increasing at an unprecedented rate, while many areas lack access to reliable power sources. This is not just a supply equation. At Trane Technologies, we see tremendous opportunities on the demand side. In an average building, we estimate a staggering 30% of energy after the meter is wasted. Our solutions are addressing this head-on, helping our customers save energy and reduce emissions, with a strong return on investment. We are setting the pace for the industry and paving the way to a more sustainable world. With our leading innovation, robust customer demand, and talented team, we're well positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value over the long term.\nPlease turn to slide number four. Q2 is another strong quarter, marked by record bookings and revenues, a 90 basis point expansion in adjusted operating margins, and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. Our enterprise and Americas commercial HVAC organic bookings reached new all-time highs, with increases of 4% and over 20%, respectively. In our Americas commercial HVAC business, we continue to lead the industry by solving our customers' most complex challenges with applied solutions in large, high-growth verticals. Notably, orders for applied solutions surged by over 60% in the quarter and are up over 120% on a two-year stack. Our commercial HVAC businesses have demonstrated remarkable durability and resilience, achieving compounded growth over multiple years. Our project pipelines are expanding, underscoring continued opportunities ahead. Our direct sales strategy enables us to capture a significant share of these opportunities and consistently outgrow our end markets.\nOur backlog remains strong at $7.1 billion US dollars, up 6% compared to year-end 2024. There was a sequential decline from the Q1 of approximately $125 million US dollars, which was due to expected backlog reductions in our shorter-cycle businesses, mainly residential. Our commercial HVAC book-to-bill ratio exceeds 100% in all regions, further elevating our global commercial HVAC backlog. Our services business remains robust, representing 1/3 of our enterprise revenues. We delivered low teens growth in the quarter, and have maintained a low teens compound annual growth rate since the inception of Trane Technologies in 2020. We are effectively managing and mitigating all enacted tariffs and inflationary impacts through our world-class business operating system. This system includes advanced mechanisms for pricing, supply chain management, and scenario planning, which we leverage to offset tariffs, drive market outgrowth, and minimize the impact on our customers.\nAs we review the key drivers for the quarter, our results were in line with expectations, with two notable exceptions. First, Americas commercial HVAC. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, exceeding our expectations and aligning with our track record of consistent market outperformance. Second, residential HVAC revenues fell short of our expectations due to a near-term industry shortage of our 454B refrigerant cylinders. However, the strength in our Americas commercial HVAC business more than compensated for this, positively impacting our adjusted EPS for the quarter. Overall, we are confident in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which Chris will cover in more detail shortly. Please turn to slide number five. In our Americas segment, as we discussed, commercial HVAC continues to deliver standout performance. In the Q1 of 2025, this business achieved all-time high quarterly bookings.\nIn the Q2, we surpassed this record by nearly $300 million US dollars, with growth of over 20%. Revenue growth continues to be exceptional, increasing by mid-teens on top of a mid-20s growth comp in the prior year. Our market outgrowth has been consistent, compounding year after year. For perspective, in the Q2, three-year stack commercial HVAC revenues are up approximately 60%, with equipment up approximately 80%, led by applied. Our growth in applied solutions is broad-based, aided by market outgrowth in sectors with large CapEx investments, such as data centers, and high-tech industrial. These sectors require the most complex applied solutions, and our ability to win more than our fair share of business here adds to our leading growth profile. CapEx spend in these sectors is expected to remain high over the next several years, providing further growth opportunities.\nIn addition, applied solutions carry strong service revenue tails, generating 8 to 10 times the equipment sale, meaning the majority of the revenue from our applied growth is still ahead of us. Turning to residential, revenues were down mid-single digits due to the near-term cylinder-related headwinds I discussed earlier. However, combining our strong Q1 revenues, up high teens, with our Q2, our year-to-date residential revenues are up 3%. Additionally, we saw very strong growth in the Q2 of 2024, up low teens, which was a multiple of the industry growth rate. Given the varying business models of mix of two-step versus three-step distribution across the industry, it's important to look at residential over the long term to get a clear picture of growth trends.\nIn Americas transport refrigeration, bookings were up low single digits, while revenues were down low single digits, significantly outperforming end markets, which were down over 30%. In EMEA, commercial HVAC bookings were down low single digits, against a tough 20% prior-year growth comp. However, two-year stack bookings were strong, up high teens. Revenues were up low single digits, impacted by timing of customer shipments from Q2 into the second half. EMEA transport organic bookings were down low single digits, while revenues were up low single digits, significantly outperforming end markets, which were down low single digits. In Asia Pacific, the quarter met our expectations. As we approach the anniversary of our tightened credit policies in China, we expect results to improve. The region is on track to meet full-year 2025 expectations for flat revenues, with stronger performance in the rest of Asia. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. This slide underscores our robust Q2 performance. Organic revenues increased by 7%, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 70 basis points, and adjusted EPS rose by 18%. Our services business delivered impressive organic revenue growth, up in the low teens, while our equipment business achieved mid-single-digit growth despite softer residential results. Please turn to slide number seven. Our Americas segment delivered 9% revenue growth, driven by our commercial HVAC business. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 120 basis points to 24%, marking a record quarterly EBITDA for the segment. Margin expansion was fueled by volume growth, productivity, and price realization, despite softer residential revenue. In EMEA, revenue growth was up 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 200 basis points, consistent with our expectations.\nWe are doubling down on channel investments and M&A integrations in 2025 to support our growth and position for future opportunities. These strategic investments are impacting margins this year, as expected. In Asia Pacific, revenue declined by high single digits, and adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 220 basis points, primarily due to lower volumes in China, consistent with our expectations. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. 2025 is shaping up largely as expected, with modest adjustments in our Americas commercial HVAC and residential outlooks. In residential, we face temporary headwinds mainly affecting Q2 and Q3 of 2025 due to the cylinder shortage. We expect this issue to improve in Q3 and be resolved by year-end. At this point in the selling season, we also believe it's prudent to factor inventory normalization into the second-half outlook. The estimated revenue impact of these combined headwinds is roughly $150 million US dollars for the second half. We now expect residential revenues to be flat for the full year versus our prior expectations of mid-to-high single-digit growth. We expect to return to a healthy GDP-plus framework over the long term. On the positive side, our Americas commercial HVAC business continues to exceed expectations, particularly in complex, bespoke applied solutions.\nLeveraging our best-in-class operating system and direct sales force, we have consistently outperformed our end markets over multiple years. For 2025, we are raising our Americas commercial HVAC outlook from high single digits to low double digits. Overall, while we're addressing temporary challenges in residential, the strength of our commercial HVAC business more than offsets these impacts and provides clear long-term benefits for our stakeholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. We are raising our revenue guidance to approximately 8% organic growth, up from 7% to 8% previously, and our adjusted EPS to approximately $13.05 US dollars, up 16% year-over-year, and up from $12.70 to 12.90 US dollars previously. With the US dollars softening through the end of Q2, we now expect FX to be neutral for the year. M&A contribution remains unchanged at 100 basis points for the year. We expect to manage and mitigate all enacted tariff impacts through proactive measures, including pricing. Based on tariffs in place as of 28 July 2024, we estimate the cost impact in 2025 to be approximately $140 million US dollars, roughly half of our estimate provided at the end of the Q1, and our full-year organic revenue growth guidance includes an estimated pricing impact from tariffs.\nThe tariff environment remains dynamic, and we will provide updates as appropriate throughout the year. We continue to target organic leverage of 25% or higher for the year, consistent with our long-term goals, and we anticipate another year of 100% or greater free cash flow conversion. For the Q3, we expect approximately 6% organic revenue growth and around $3.80 US dollars in adjusted EPS, consistent with the outlook dynamics Dave highlighted earlier. For additional details related to our guidance, please refer to slide 16. Please turn to slide number 10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on deploying excess cash to maximize shareholder returns. First, we strengthen our core business through relentless reinvestment. Second, we maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure flexibility as markets evolve. Third, we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nOur approach includes strategic M&A to enhance long-term returns and share repurchases when the stock trades below intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 11. Year-to-date through July, we've deployed approximately $1.5 billion US dollars through our balanced capital allocation strategy, including $420 million US dollars to dividends, approximately $15 million US dollars to M&A, $900 million US dollars to share repurchases, and $150 million US dollars for debt retirement. These figures exclude $260 US dollars million from M&A and $100 million US dollars from share repurchases made earlier in the year, which were included in our full-year 2024 capital deployment targets, as discussed during our Q4 earnings call. We have approximately $5.3 billion US dollars remaining under repurchase authorizations, providing us with significant share repurchase optionality moving forward. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach.\nOverall, our strong free cash flow, liquidity, balance sheet, and substantial share repurchase authorization offer excellent capital allocation optionality as we move forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 13. The Americas transport refrigeration markets have been volatile, as have ACT's forecast, but the long-term outlook remains strong. For 2026 and 2027, ACT projects a strong rebound with greater than 20% growth each year. We're managing well through the down cycle. We continue to invest in innovation, and we look forward to adding another significant growth driver to our enterprise portfolio in 2026 and beyond. Please go to slide number 14. In summary, we have the optimal strategy, team, and capabilities to deliver leading financial performance in 2025 and beyond. Our uplifting, inclusive culture helps us attract the best talent in the market, powering our innovation. Our solutions offer strong returns to customers, and also contribute to a sustainable world. This drives our consistent track record of leading financial performance and positions us to deliver differentiated shareholder value over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit your questions to one and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask on commercial HVAC, specifically in the Americas. Obviously, this business has been strong for a number of years, but the Q2 order acceleration was really a standout, kind of 20% plus versus low to mid-single digit in the prior quarters. Can you maybe just kind of talk about what end markets are driving that acceleration? Are you seeing a broadening of the strength? Do you think commercial HVAC could be getting better?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I'll start with Chris adding. Look, we had exceptionally strong results in Q2 2025 for our commercial HVAC business here in the Americas. You said at all-time high bookings, up over 20%. I would also tell you revenue was very strong. It was up in the two-year stack. Bookings are up over 40%. It's led by Applied. Our Applied solutions were up over 60% in the quarter. Our two-year stack Applied is up over 120%. Yeah, we are executing extremely well in that business. I would tell you to your question, it's really broad-based growth once again. Yeah, sure, we had some nice strengths in healthcare. We had nice strengths in government. We had strength in data centers. We had strength in higher ed.\nAs I look across the 14 verticals that we track, I would tell you the majority of them were positive, which you would expect from Trane Technologies with our direct sales force, with expertise across all of these verticals. Look, that team continues to execute well. I would just, before I turn it over to Chris, the pipeline of activity, we do a lot of work tracking pipelines. I would tell you that remains very, very strong. The last point I'll make is our services business, once again, here we are at low teens growth. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone because our compound annual growth rate, really, since the inception of Trane Technologies, has been in that same range. Very strong, and I'm very proud of what that team has been able to accomplish. Chris, I don't know if you have anything you want to add.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nI'll add on the bookings and the revenue growth. If you remove data centers from the vertical, very strong growth, ex-data centers, in both revenues and bookings. We like that growth in data centers. We were strong in data centers in the quarter. You remove that, very strong growth as well.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. The only other thing I would add, Chris, because I know it's a typical question, is, well, what happened with Applied and Unitary? Obviously, we had a lot of strength in Applied. I would tell you both were positive. Applied was stronger than Unitary, as you would expect, because of the broad-based growth that we're seeing. We're serving, again, all the verticals, and some of those verticals are more dominated with Unitary product versus Applied.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nNo, thank you. I really appreciate that. Super supportive to hear about the broadening. I did kind of want to follow up on what does that mean for the service flywheel? In the past, Dave, you've talked about maybe a two-year rough lag between when the equipment starts driving service revenue. If we look at commercial HVAC equipment, it top-line accelerated in 2023 and 2024, kind of versus where it was at previously. What does that mean for the outlook for service into the back half of the year? Any color on what's implied for the back half service growth guide? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, you're spot on, right? Our service business is really built around our Applied portfolio. It doesn't mean we don't service Unitary, but it's really built around our Applied portfolio. We model that it's 8 to 10x versus the equipment price what we'll get over services over the life of that asset. It's a compounding effect, right? You can see that our growth has really been quite substantial for a number of years, and that compounding is now starting to impact our service business. Look, we're at the low teens. I'm not going to commit more than that because I think that's very healthy. We're putting a lot of investments in our service business, and it's 1/3 of our company. I would tell you it's very, very resilient, and it's got a lot of upside in the future. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. As you described services on a regional basis, the margins with services are accretive to the segment margins of each of our regions. To your point, Chris, yes, it takes maybe a couple of years post-warranty to start seeing the inflection point of revenues. We're connected to those customers from day one. We're making sure maintenance is getting performed, executing to service plans. That five-year kegger now of low double-digit services growth gives us a lot of confidence that revenue is really in front of us when we think about these Applied bookings today.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Just one other point is, if you think about it today, right? Services, roughly, if I go to our commercial HVAC business, think of it half equipment, half services. Another thing that's really accelerating services is these connected solutions. We were talking about the other day, I had a meeting on how many connected buildings do we have with BrainBox included in that equation. We're up to over 60,000 connected buildings and millions of connected assets. Now we're able to have a lot of structured data that we've had as Trane Technologies adding on BrainBox. We're now starting to augment that with some of the unstructured data.\nAs far as the energy efficiency that we're able to achieve in buildings now, it's not only getting the building to operate the way it was designed, it's how can we even do better than that versus how the building is actually being utilized. It's a very exciting time at Trane Technologies, specifically in our services business.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, appreciate all the information.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just first off, wanted to try and understand the second half Americas organic sales growth outlook a little bit better. I suppose is the sort of Americas framework, it's kind of high single-digit organic growth, both Q3 and Q4, and then you have Rezzi and transport down mid-single in both quarters year-on-year. Is that the right way to think about that guidance?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian, it's Chris. Yeah, we've guided the Q3 to 6% organic revenue growth. The implied guidance for the Q4 would be in that 9% range. Think about commercial HVAC Americas being very consistent Q3 and Q4, really up low double digits in both quarters. It's a tougher compare, actually, in the Q3 to prior year results in commercial HVAC up high teens, and easier compare in the Q4 for commercial HVAC up mid-teens a year ago. Think of that business as continuing to execute. We've got a lot of visibility in the backlog to when projects need to be shipped and revenued. We see that being consistent across the quarters. Think of transport probably more down in the Q3 as Dave explained, those markets continue to be under pressure.\nMaybe that's a little more flattish in the Q4. Residential, we've in the second half of the year taken about $150 million US dollars of revenue out in the second half. Think of that as more in the Q3 than the Q4. We're expecting residential to be down more in that high single-digit range for Q3, and we'll sequentially do better in the Q4. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of context around the Americas segment.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you, Chris. My second question, I suppose, just following up on that residential side of things, sort of help us understand on the cylinder point, the sort of progress on getting that resolved. Beyond that supply chain issue, I suppose on the demand side, are you seeing any change in customer behavior around sort of mixing down or repair versus replace? Anything on the competitive side shifting?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Julian, how are you? This is Dave. Look, we started the year in Q1 very strong in residential. We were up in the high teens. The Q2 was down 6%. Year to date, we're up 3%. Look, we have a very, very high concentration in our inventory channels of 454B product. When we had a bottleneck that occurred really towards the end of April, we were impacted. We reacted quickly. We've been overcharging units from the factory since May. We're working very closely with the suppliers of the refrigerants. We know what they have committed to us. We know what they have committed to the industry. I mean, I guess the good news is, yeah, it was an impact. It's isolated, okay?\nAs we sit here on 30 July 2024, I would say that we could argue whether it's 90% or 95% of this is behind us. We're looking forward, and we'll get this business back to what our framework is, which over the long term is a GDP plus business. In the second half, we're forecasting inventory coming out of the channel. We talked about having high inventory at the end of the Q1. Unfortunately, that inventory is still there as we exit the Q2. That will burn through. As Chris said, that'll be more of an impact in Q3 versus Q4. On your question on repair versus replace, look, it was probably a difficult quarter to be able to decipher what's happening there with the bottleneck in refrigerant. We'll see what happens as the year progresses.\nWe haven't seen anything. Again, I think it was probably not the optimal quarter to see if that's actually moving more to repair versus replace. We're obviously watching that very closely. The last thing I'll say on residential is, and I know you heard me say this at the end of the Q1 when we had high teens growth, look at residential over the long term, right? There are a lot of different models out there as far as how we satisfy this channel, two-step, three-step. You could have one competitor look like they're gaining share and then losing share. Look at the long term and look at the growth trends over the long term. The good news is, we look forward to getting back to our framework, which is a GDP plus business.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you, Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Dave and Chris back.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott, how are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood. It's getting to be a broken record, but congrats again on the numbers and such.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nA couple little ones. I mean, your incrementals sequentially went up from kind of 25% to 32%. Was that mostly just a mix, or was there timing on investment spend, or any other kind of things that impacted that?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nScott, as Chris, I'll start. I mean, in the quarter, nice growth in our services business, right? We like the margins in services, really good productivity in the factories, and it's a hallmark to make sure that we're offsetting other inflation with productivity. That was strong in the quarter, and even the volume growth, we got strong leverage on that. All in, really just managing the full P&L here in the Q2, but gives us a lot of confidence that the full year will be 25% or better incrementals.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Don't think that we haven't stopped investing, Scott, because we continue to invest at a very high level back into the business. This is all about future growth.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Understood. You seem more confident in the China outlook this quarter than back in April. Has the entire market adjusted? I mean, I know your US competitors have followed suit with pricing terms, credit, and such down payments, etc. Have your foreign competitors adjusted in suit, and has there been a kind of a reset of that market at more favorable terms for you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think it's mixed. I mean, the good news there is, look, in Asia, it really met our expectations. We think the full year is going to be flat. It's a smaller part of our business, as you know. The good news is, our anniversary of our tightened credit policy is upon us, so the comps certainly get easier. With that said, our team, if you look at the sequentials, right, and we spent a lot of time analyzing this, the sequentials are improving. Now, you got to take seasonality out of that, but the sequentials are improving from when we first put in these new credit policies to where we are today. We're very confident in saying that Asia will be flat for the year, and the good news is our China credit policies have had a one-year birthday. We're moving forward.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott, I love your videos too. Keep it up, okay?\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'll try. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning, Dave, Chris. How are you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood. How are you?\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGood. I guess, Chris, we're moving to the higher end of the CapEx range. Do we think the higher CapEx translates to kind of a burning of the backlog, or do you still expect backlog to stay elevated? Just kind of related to that, I think 50% of the product revenue is sitting in backlog today. Just curious in terms of how much visibility does that give you actually into 2026 from where we stand today?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, backlog remains elevated through the end of the Q2. Our expectation, Amit, is that it's going to remain elevated through the balance of this year going into next year. We're building backlog already for 2026 and beyond. We've got about $2.5 billion US dollars in backlog for 2026 and beyond at this point in time, so it's giving us some good visibility to next year. With lead times really coming in over the last 18 months, 24 months, you're seeing orders getting placed at roughly a time that's maybe only six months away, nine months away from when deliveries go out, especially in the applied space. That really then refers to what Dave talked about on pipelines, making sure we have really good insight on the pipelines, and those continue to be growing. Yeah, I think backlog will remain elevated. Right now, it's actually over 90% of our backlog is commercial HVAC globally, and the majority of that's applied.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe good news of it is we were kind of early in the CapEx investing in capacity, and now with really the surge in our applied business, we're able to meet our customers' expectations from a delivery standpoint. No issues there.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just one follow-up on growth in data centers and how that growth piece is kind of evolving. I mean, obviously, some of these next-generation chips are proliferating now more than they were before. I noticed you guys talked about kind of expanding your liquid cooling product last month, I think, if I saw that correctly. Can you just talk about, I know you guys are very well positioned in that vertical, and you've been doing it for a long time. In terms of the fastest growing parts within the data center, can you just talk about how you guys are positioned there?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, I think the data center vertical, and I've been saying this for years now, it's one of those verticals that moves really, really fast from a technology standpoint. We're on it, right? We're constantly working with the data center customers, which I can't name by name. They're constantly in our labs, and we're working together. Yeah, we did introduce a CDU. That's part of the solution. Obviously, our water-cooled, air-cooled portfolio is extremely important there. Our air handling systems are very important there. Different aspect ratios of those air handling systems are very important there. We like to look at things at a system level, okay? When you do that, you start to see where the opportunities are. These customers want a strong partner, and they want differentiation.\nI mean, I was telling a group the other day, we did a project in Australia. I can't say who it was with, but we measure efficiencies of systems by the COP, or coefficient of performance. We were able to get a coefficient of performance for this customer in Australia, very large data center. The COP was north of 10. That was unheard of. If I told someone that four years ago, they'd think I was kidding them, right? These are the types of innovations that our very clever, experienced engineering teams are able to develop with these data center customers. Look, we're excited about data centers, but we're more than just data centers. You could tell that by our broad-based growth.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, man.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you?\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? Dave or Chris, someone asked about margin, but I wanted to ask it maybe a slightly different way. Organic leverage was impressive despite Asia Pacific and European margins down. I think Q2's Americas margin was the highest we've seen from Trane. I'm just trying to figure out how enduring Americas' performance is. I know you said you want to continue to invest, but there's a lot going on: mix-up, better productivity. You're burning more complex, large applied jobs. I'm trying to figure out if they're a cleaver or not. Maybe just all this interplay, the durability of this Americas' performance moving forward.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andy, I'll start. Look, I think the old tape of the mix of businesses having different margins, hopefully that puts us finally to rest as you think about the commercial HVAC performance in the quarter and what we were able to perform there. I really think it's across the P&L in terms of where we saw the benefits and the leverage. The strong productivity, good incrementals on volumes, price over inflation on a dollars basis and a percentage basis, also making sure we're making the investments in the business. I think the Q2 is really kind of following the same playbook. Margins came in a little bit ahead, healthy leverage there. Again, the services business continues to drive margin accretion as part of 1/3 of the portfolio of the enterprise. We've not changed the formula. The investment flywheel continues. We just say that we're really confident that we'll have growth in the full year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nIt's helpful, Chris. Dave, I think you guys mentioned that your unitary business is still doing reasonably well, which is a bit of a contrast versus some of your peers. I know it's difficult to draw lines between larger unitary and applied. Maybe talk about sort of that particular end market and why Trane is outperforming.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, look, first of all, I think the unitary market is going to be much softer than the applied market, at least here in the Americas. Look, we continue to, we're performing well, really. I mean, as I said, applied was much stronger than unitary. Both were positive, that's a good thing. Andy, I think it really goes to the focus we have on the broad base of the verticals that we're servicing. There's some verticals that have more of a concentration around unitary solutions.\nWith the direct sales force and being able to have expertise within our regional offices, we're able to capture where those growth opportunities are. It's really just good execution. I would say we're now into the kind of the book and burn kind of side of that unitary with the replacement market with high heat. We'll see how the year finishes out, but we're happy with our performance right now, really across our commercial HVAC businesses, but certainly here in the Americas.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color, Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right, thanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you?\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Doing great, thanks. Hey, Chris, can you maybe just unpack the guidance increase? Twenty-five cents at the midpoint. It seems like, look, FX is about a nickel, and you're only increasing your organic growth by 50 basis points. Is this just going to be better margins, better performance in the first half? Just help me unpack the $0.25 US dollars number.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Last guide for the year was $12.70 US dollars to 12.90 US dollars. We said we were really at the higher end of that range three months ago, Joe. Raising it to $13.05 US dollars on the full year, think about that as taking the Q2 beat and then some and passing it through. FX was probably around in that range of what you were talking about. It really is the operational performance in the business that I think we like, putting out guidance that we can meet, achieve, or exceed. The fact is the operational performance is really led by commercial HVAC. The execution in the team is really driving the performance and how we think about the outlook for the balance of the year. On revenues, think about it as to get to the 8% on the full year versus where we were three months ago.\nThink of it as a stronger commercial HVAC Americas business. We're taking that guidance up to low double digits in terms of revenue growth. Residential, we think prudently we've reduced the revenues around $300 million US dollars on the full year. That's about a rough point and a half at the enterprise. That's a subtraction. We're layering in ± tariff pricing where we're really trying to thread the needle between the price-cost equation there on pricing to really offset the cost, starting with mitigating the cost, but then ultimately trying to price for any residual. That's really the puts and takes on the top line. A lot of confidence on the operational performance here driving comfort and raising the bottom line.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That makes a lot of sense, Chris. Maybe just my follow-up, Dave, going back to your comments earlier about getting back to being a GDP-plus business on the residential side of things. I know it's early, but as you're kind of thinking through maybe beyond this year and this whole, some of the noise that we're experiencing here because of the refrigerant change, when you start thinking about 2026, is that a year where we start getting back potentially to GDP-plus from a volume standpoint on resi HVAC? Also, just how are you thinking about pricing? There's a lot of pricing that went into the system, and the elasticity of your dealer network or customers ultimately taking on additional price in resi.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Look, first of all, I think we had an isolated incident in Q2, number one, right? We didn't see that coming. I don't think the industry saw that coming. There's no structural problems within residential, and people need to really understand that. We've been saying for a while that this is a GDP-plus business. Look, there's a lot of noise out there in 2025, a lot of change happening there, a little bump in the road here in Q2. We believe we're going to get back to a GDP-plus business. I'll give you a more definitive answer when we get our, when we pour our Q4, we talk about the guide for 2026. Look, overall, this is a good business. Don't let the noise confuse you. It's a good, solid business. We do well here. This is going to get back on track here. Like I said, there's no structural problems within the industry.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm good. Thanks as always for the details. Can you just maybe hash out for resi what your price and mix expectations are for the back half? Can you help us parse out, I think you guys said $75 to 100 million US dollars in pre-buy last year. Maybe square that with the $150 million US dollars number.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nLet me start with your first question, residential. We're expecting in the second half, if I remove the 454B impact from volumes, which is really how we started the year in thinking about it, but if we really want to isolate volume impact from price, then we're expecting volumes to be down in the second half, more so in the Q3 based on how that $150 million US dollars of revenue reduction in the second half, that's more, Steve, in the Q3 than it is in the Q4. We expect both quarters to see some volume reduction in the second half. Dave talked about having to get some of that inventory out of the channel as well. We think that that's prudent. Pricing is in that double-digit range, low double-digit range. Net-net, it's a reduction in the second half, and that gets you to roughly flattish on residential for the full year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nRight. Yeah, because your mix is included in that volume, right? That's the way you guys report it. The mix is kind of included in your volume discussion?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, that's how we started it. If I remove that mix from volume and I say, okay, let's just put the isolate volume.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. Got it.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nVolumes are down, right? I just think that was prudent to maybe talk about it that way this time around.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nYeah. Okay. The $75 to 100 million US dollars, that pre-buy, that came, I don't quite recall, that came mostly in the fourth, correct? Last year that you guys had estimated?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThink of it as $100 million US dollars, right? If you remember in Q1, we had a very strong Q1, but we said the $100 million US dollars is still there. I think we probably replaced the 410 with the 454 product, which is obviously that's where we had the bottleneck that occurred. We believe that our inventory in that independent wholesale distributor channel is still at an elevated level. Think of it in that $100 to 125 million US dollars range . There's still a bit of noise with the 454B canister replacements. That's how you get to the $150 million US dollars, Steve, roughly.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. Got it. Just one last quick one on services. Really good, obviously, growth around the low double digits. It's decelerating a bit from the mid-teens you guys did last year. I think the HVAC cycle really picked up a couple of years ago. Is there anything moving around that is influencing that? You said two years from the pickup, you'd start to see an acceleration. Is there anything going on outside of this chiller tail, if you will, in services? I guess the implication is, is that low double-digit number that you're seeing today, does that accelerate because of all the applied stuff that you're putting in there now?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, we always like to see it accelerate things. Look, I think the only, first of all, we're very happy with our service business. We're investing a lot in it. It is 1/3 of the company, and it's had stellar performance, really, over a long period of time. If I had to say what's changing there, it really comes to these connected solutions, Steve. I think early on, we explained to you about how being connected to the asset, think of it as continuous commissioning. That has now really started to accelerate. Hopefully, that becomes more of a flywheel in the future. We have a lot of people working on it.\nIt's part of some of the big investments that we're making there to make sure that we can ensure that this 30% of energy after the meter, we estimate that number to be very conservative, is being wasted, right? We know we have solutions today that can solve that. I think as the price of energy continues to escalate, that's going to become more relevant to everyone. It also provides great, great paybacks for our solutions. I think that you're going to hear more of that in the future. I know you're hearing it from Trane Technologies, but you're going to hear more of that in the future because the demand side does not get enough attention. We want to talk a lot about the supply side. The demand side, okay, if we're wasting precious energy, that is something that we can solve relatively quickly. It provides paybacks for customers.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nRight. Yeah, it's good growth. It's good growth. 12% is very good growth, obviously. Thanks a lot for the details.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Steve. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nI'm doing great, thanks. Maybe just a few nits to wrap up here on my side. Just, hey, Chris, back to your comment about resi price mix, low double digit. I would have thought mix itself was maybe 10-ish. Can you just give us a little bit more color on kind of the mix effect you're getting, and then what kind of price you're actually getting on top of that?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I just put a price mix together, Jeff, and that's up the low double digits here in the second half. That'd be inclusive of what we're seeing on 454B and otherwise. Mix is obviously a part of that, but I just put it together.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Just on tariffs again, Chris, you mentioned your margin positive in the quarter on tariffs. I don't know if that was a tariff isolated number or a total kind of inflation number, but do you see your expectations for the balance of the year imply that you remain margin accretive on inflation?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Jeff, my comment was really around just price and inflation all in. Think about inflation not just being tariffs, but as we think about our commodities, our tier one, our tier two, and just making sure that price is staying ahead of inflation, part of our business operating system. That was my comment there. On tariffs, look, it was pretty modest, almost immaterial impact here in the Q2. The pricing on tariffs, assuming what we knew as of Monday hold, since it's very dynamic, as we all know, with negotiations ongoing, that'll ramp as it moves throughout the year. The goal is still to keep mitigating the actual impact, but we know that if there is a net impact, we're going to have to plan us to price for it. Don't think of it as it's margin accretive on tariffs. We're going to thread the needle to make sure that it is margin neutral on a dollars basis. We don't want this to become a profit center, that may take a little bit of time to get there. Ultimately, that's our target, and we're still executing to that.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're welcome. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets",
    "content2": "Doing really well. Thank you. Hey, I'm really interested in how many times this revenue multiplier has been talked about on the call, the 8 to 10x over the economic life of the business. How does that vary either by region or probably more by application? I would imagine data centers got to be the highest given how complex and redundancy they have, but maybe it's more how much connected the systems are, like that continuous commissioning. How does that vary, the 8 to 10x, and might it go higher the more connected the customer is?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI don't see it going higher, okay? I think the higher would be on the energy savings, and it'd probably be a different revenue stream that would be in the future on the digital side. On the 8 to 10, think of it as it doesn't really vary by region. It would vary by product, okay? Think of it as the more sophisticated chillers are in that 8 to 10 range. Obviously, unitary, we're not including that when we say that because that's not the focus of our service business. Don't think of it as a regional variation. Think of it more as a product variation. We're obviously very strong in the chiller portfolio, and that's a big part of our service business. That's where we would see this 8 to 10x tale.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's really helpful. Just to follow up, on data center, you divided up your commercial, made a reference between data center and non-data center. Your competitor yesterday did the same thing. How did data center do in the quarter? What kind of growth rate are you expecting for the year for that vertical?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Deane, it's a great question. We're not going to size it there. We haven't sized our data center business for various competitive reasons. I think when I think about the applied bookings, and that's where data center bookings would go into, I think we're getting more than our fair share. I think it really comes down to innovation. It comes down to those relationships that Dave talked about, and having the direct salesforce that stays connected with these customers over a long period of time to innovate for the solutions today and then what they want to bring in two to three years' time. The 120% two-year stack of applied bookings is really indicative of our strength across all the verticals. It's important to highlight, it's not just data centers. We don't want it to solely be that.\nThese are verticals that have ebbs and flows, and we like having the broad-based growth. We're there when these verticals, if they're slower now and they return, we like having that salesforce direct and exposed to that. That's why we just keep investing fully in our services business to make sure we're ready after the applied business comes in. We've got the ability to execute on services.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's really helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I promise you no more resi questions. I think we've beaten that dead horse too.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNigel, I was going to ask you what you have in your home, but you probably won't tell me.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI'm not going to disclose that information. It's confidential information, but I'll tell you offline. Here we go. I just want to pick up on the last question around the applied, the broad-based strength. You called out education and healthcare. In education, we've had a lot of angst around the SF funding rolling off, muni bond issuance, etc. In healthcare, we know the hospitals have got a lot of funding pressures. Just curious, specifically within those two markets, what do you think is driving the continued strength in order patterns?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, education, we've been saying for a while, look, just because that's where funding is, it's not behind us from a revenue stream, but it's behind us from an order stream. Don't assume that market's going to fall off a cliff because if anything, it kind of heightened the demand for how underinvested in the infrastructure is of many of the schools around the, certainly here in the United States. Well, we still see activity there, but we see really strong growth in the higher ed side of things. This is really where the universities are using their physical space and how they control that physical space as a way to attract students into their organization. If you've ever had the opportunity to go on a tour, they'll talk about that, about their dormitories and how they're conditioned and what they're doing for indoor air quality.\nWe're seeing a lot of demand there. As you would expect, that's right in our sweet spot. These are usually complex systems. In some cases, they're retrofitting buildings that are extremely aged, and the solutions sometimes become more complicated than you might imagine. We're doing really, really well there.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nWell, I'm going through that process with my second boy now. I'll definitely keep my ears out for that indoor air quality. I was kind of hoping you're going to talk about heat, electrification of heat, and sorry.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOn a separate call, you could tell me what schools you're going to, and I'll let you know, okay?\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Well, let's have that call. I was kind of hoping you're going to talk about maybe sort of electrification of heat, but maybe touch on that in a separate question. In China, I know it's not a huge business for you, but we're seeing just broad-based another step down, it seems, in China, which might not be a big surprise based on the stats we're seeing from the market there. Just maybe talk about what you've seen in China, and more importantly around pricing, around credit quality, and things like that. Just wondering if there could be some risks going forward in China.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Nigel, I'll start with Chris. Look, the Asia region makes up around 7% of our enterprise revenues, and half of that would be China, half of that would be rest of Asia. Think of that as 10-plus countries that we operate in. We're seeing the slower markets in China. To Dave's point, it was a year ago that we implemented the tighter credit policies there. Now, starting in the Q3 of 2025, we've got comps that are comparable to that credit policy implementation from a year ago. We think from a comp perspective, things certainly get easier, but we're watchful. It's a choppy environment for sure, and it's why we're viewing still the Asia segment to be flattish on the full year, with declines in China, with positive performance in the rest of Asia. Let's see how it plays out, but we're investing still in that region. It's a region-for-region methodology, and a lot of great confidence in the team there.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNigel, your question too on electrification and heating, that's still, I mean, we now have a core portfolio of products on a global basis there, and we're making a lot of headway there. It's part of this growth profile that we have.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, yes. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andrew. How are you?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI'm good. Just a little bit on transports. It seems like we're at the bottom. I know that you are referencing the ACT forecast, but the truck cycle and the reefer cycle has been very strange over the past couple of years. What do you guys see in the channel, and when do you think it bottoms? I do appreciate the ACT disclosure. Very useful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, look, at the end of the day, transport, you're right. It's been very volatile for the last, I think we kid ourselves and say we're in year three of a two-year cycle or maybe even year four of a two-year down cycle. We do see that ACT is going to come back, or I'm sorry, the market's going to come back in 2026. That's what ACT's saying now. We're looking forward to it. The key here is make sure that you're investing in the business when it is in a downturn. That's what we've been able to do. We have a lot of really cool solutions that we're now having in the marketplace. One of the reasons why we're clearly outperforming the end markets is because of that.\nWe're looking forward to this coming back in 2026, and we're going to be ready for it. Look, as an old president for the Thermo King business earlier in my career, this is a great business, and it's going to be very successful in the future.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI appreciate it. Just on data centers, as you have noted, you've introduced the CDU. Any interest in getting more scale in this area through M&A? I think there might be some sort of private equity assets available down the line.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andrew, it's Chris. I mean, as a large player, we get a chance to see just about everything that comes across from an M&A perspective. We will remain disciplined. We will look at returns, we will look at where we can integrate, where we can drive value. Certainly, we like the space that we're in, we like having the partnerships that we have, and then the relationships with customers over time. As you know, we've got the financial firepower to do almost anything, but we're going to remain disciplined here around M&A.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIs there sort of a limit on how big an asset? All your acquisitions have been very prudent, but they've been really bolt-ons. Would you be willing to step up for something larger in a critical area?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would just say, look, bolt-ons for us is a billion dollars or less, and that number keeps growing as we keep growing. We like the bolt-ons, we like the channel investments, we like the early-stage technologies, and match it up with deep channel. Maybe a little bit below the radar, but we've had, I think it's 25 to 30 acquisitions over the last five years.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's right, yeah.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, deployed over $1 billion US dollars of capital to them, I think closer to $1.5 billion US dollars. Look, we like that flywheel. We look at everything, and if we think that there's an option that makes sense, we'll certainly give it a look. We'll remain disciplined, I think, is the key message.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nReally appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andrew. You're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Chris, just to go back to Jeff's question, can you give us the updated price assumption for the enterprise for the year? Maybe more broadly, we can talk through where pricing power is and applied given the booking strength and the fact that you're always pricing for value creation.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think for price on the full year, think of that, it's probably a bit above 3 points. We delivered 3 points in the Q1. We were tracking a bit above 3 points in the Q2. For the full year, as we're baking tariffs in there, we're probably a bit above 3 points on the full year. Think of volume as really closer to 5 points on the full year.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Maybe just add one more on EMEA. You mentioned those channel investments, and the margins improving in the back half. Maybe just if you can help us think about how that translates to growth accelerating, stronger incrementals setting up in 2026. I'm sure these investments are really fortifying your channel position there.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Think of them as investments in the channel for both transport and our commercial HVAC business, thinking about where we have partners and where we want to grow share. Those are just businesses, actually part of the bolt-on acquisitions we've done over the last six or nine months. They just come with low operating margins that impact the margins in the region. I mean, we're talking a bit around the law of small numbers here as well, but very much part of our plans for the year. You're right. What it does is it gives us even more optionality to have formidable businesses going forward and continuing to drive revenue growth well above what the markets are showing in both of those platforms. This is very modest in terms of the relative scale to EMEA, but we think the right long-term decision here, and I think it'll continue to give us confidence we're going to outperform those markets in EMEA.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAll right, thanks so much for the call.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks. You're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude our question and answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for any closing comments.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining me on today's call. Much appreciate all the good questions. We'll be on the road in the coming months, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. Obviously, we'll be around over the coming days and weeks to take any investor questions or analyst calls and questions. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

My name is Regina, and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit your questions to one and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Finance and Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies Q4 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and everyone for joining today's call. Please turn to slide number three. I'd like to begin with a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our differentiated financial results over time. At Trane Technologies, we continuously innovate for a sustainable world, and our innovation is driving significant customer demand. We are the partner of choice to ensure optimal performance while reducing energy use and emissions. Our customers know that our solutions are green for green, good for the planet, and good for the bottom line. Our relentless investment in innovation powers our flywheel of market outperformance and strong free cash flow. With this momentum, our proven business operating system, and our uplifting culture, we are well-positioned to deliver a leading growth profile and differentiated shareholder value into the future. Please turn to slide number four.\nWe expect to deliver top quartile financial performance over the long term, consistently and reliably for our shareholders. This is core to our culture, and central to how we set our targets and execute our strategy across our global portfolio. 2024 was a standout year for the company. I'm proud of how our global teams exceeded our targets, top to bottom. We closely track top quartile performance against our core peer group, and believe our performance will rank in the top quartile on organic revenue growth of 12%, as well as Adjusted EPS growth of 24%. We also delivered free cash flow of $2.8 billion, or 109% free cash flow conversion, enabling us to make key strategic M&A investments while raising our dividend, and returning significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Please turn to slide number five.\nRelentless investment in innovation, growth, people, culture, and our business operating system have yielded clear benefits over time, demonstrated by our strong track record. Since 2020, we've delivered a revenue compound annual growth rate of 12%, expanded our Adjusted EBITDA margins by 400 basis points, and delivered free cash flow conversion of 108% while deploying approximately $12 billion of capital. We believe that consistent business reinvestment is key to our long-term success. For over a decade, we've added a high level of incremental investments each year in high ROI projects. This has resulted in a world-class direct sales force, channel, and service organization. It has also enabled us to develop cutting-edge solutions for the most pressing customer challenges, driving strong demand. We have all the essential ingredients to execute our strategy and continue driving differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. Please turn to slide number six.\nWe delivered robust financial results in the fourth quarter, extending our strong track record of execution and industry-leading revenue and EPS growth. Our global team achieved 10% organic revenue growth, 110 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and 20% Adjusted EPS growth. Organic bookings for full year 2024 were strong, up 11%, with a book-to-bill ratio of 102% on top of 12% organic revenue growth. This contributed to a highly elevated backlog of $6.75 billion entering 2025. We saw strong performance across our segments, led by our commercial HVAC businesses. Q4, Americas and EMEA organic commercial HVAC bookings were both strong, each up more than 30% on a three-year stack. Q4 organic revenues were exceptional, with Americas commercial HVAC up mid-50% on a three-year stack and EMEA commercial HVAC up more than 60% over the same period.\nOur teams are excelling in complex, bespoke applied projects, which are key to the multi-year CapEx cycle, especially in high-growth verticals. For instance, three-year stack organic revenue growth in applied systems for our Americas and EMEA commercial HVAC businesses is up over 120% and 90%, respectively. Applied systems offer a durable service tail of 8x to 10 the initial equipment cost over their lifespan, meaning our strong growth in applied solutions presents tremendous service opportunities with higher margins that are largely still ahead of us. Looking beyond the continued strength in commercial HVAC, we see several tailwinds in 2025. We believe residential markets have largely normalized and are returning to our long-term framework of GDP plus growth. The Americas transport refrigeration markets are expected to bottom in the first half of 2025, paving the way for a second-half recovery and strong growth in 2026 and 2027.\nIn addition, the challenges associated with our actions in the second half of 2024 to tighten credit policies in China are improving ahead of our initial expectations. Given our consistent performance over time, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2025. We are initiating a strong guide for the year, which Chris will cover in more detail in a few minutes. Please turn to slide number seven. Demand for our innovative solutions was broad-based across our segments in the fourth quarter. In our Americas segment, commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits. Revenues were up mid-teens in both equipment and services. Residential revenues were up low teens, consistent with the second and third quarters. Transport refrigeration bookings were down high twenties after being up high twenties in the third quarter, reflecting the inherent lumpiness associated with the timing of large customer orders in this business.\nRevenues were down low teens, outperforming end markets, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. In EMEA, commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits in the quarter versus a tough prior-year comp. Two-year stack bookings were up 20%. Revenue was also strong, up low teens. Our transport business performed in line with our expectations, with revenues down low single digits. In Asia-Pacific, our team demonstrated resilience, achieving strong sequential improvement. Bookings in the region were up 8%, and revenues were up 1%. Strength in the rest of Asia more than compensated for the softness in China, where bookings were down low single digits and revenues declined by low teens. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number eight. This slide provides a snapshot of our fourth quarter performance, showcasing strong execution across the board. Organic revenues were up 10%. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 110 basis points, and Adjusted EPS rose by 20%. At the enterprise level, we achieved robust organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single digits and low teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to yield results, with relentless investments in innovation driving top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth. Please turn to slide number nine. At the enterprise level, we achieved robust volume growth, positive price realization, and productivity gains that offset inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In the Americas, we delivered nine points of volume growth and two points of price. Strong performance in commercial HVAC and residential was partially offset by softer transport results.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 140 basis points, driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization. In EMEA, we delivered 6 points of volume growth and 1 point of price, with strong commercial HVAC performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 20 basis points, driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered 1 point of price, and volume was flat. EBITDA margin expansion was driven by price realization and strong productivity, more than offsetting inflation and business reinvestment. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 10. This slide outlines the key dynamics shaping our market outlook and guidance for 2025. In the Americas, we anticipate continued strong execution and broad-based strength in core markets, with particular momentum in high-growth verticals. Our world-class direct sales force and leading innovation are powerful competitive advantages that enable us to optimize opportunities and drive market outperformance. We expect residential markets to return to a GDP plus framework in 2025, following a modest pre-buy of around $75 to 100 million in Q3 and Q4 of 2024. Most of this pre-buy is expected to impact the first quarter of 2025. For the full year, we see mid-single digit growth in the residential business, with a tailwind from the low GWP mix. Turning to transport, we expect relative flat markets in 2025, ±low single digits.\nThe market should bottom in Q1, down about 25% year-over-year, then rebound in the second half, aligning with freight market recovery forecasts. While the exact timing and speed are uncertain, [AC] predicts a sharp recovery in both 2026 and 2027, up mid-teens each year. We've continued to invest heavily during the market downturn, and we are well-positioned to outperform as the market comes back. In EMEA, we expect continued strength in commercial HVAC in 2025, driven by strong execution in core markets, and tailwinds from thermal management systems, services, and key growth verticals. EMEA transport markets are expected to be flat to up low single digits in 2025, and we expect to outperform. In Asia, we anticipate a flattish market for the year due to a soft macro backdrop and our tightened credit policies impacting the first half of 2025.\nWe expect muted performance in China to be offset by growth in the rest of Asia. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 11. Our 2025 guidance reflects the market dynamics outlined on the prior slide, and our optimism about our ability to outperform. It also incorporates our value creation flywheel, emphasizing continued investment in innovation, market outgrowth, healthy leverage, and strong free cash flow. We are initiating 2025 guidance with 7% to 8 organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $12.70 to 12.90, representing approximately 13% to 15 EPS growth. This includes about 100 basis points of negative FX, and roughly 50 basis points of growth from M&A impacting revenue, which together are expected to negatively impact earnings by about $0.20 for the year. We are targeting organic leverage of 25% or higher, consistent with our long-term goals. We anticipate another year of 100% or greater free cash flow conversion in 2025.\nLooking at the first quarter of 2025, we expect approximately 6% to 7 organic revenue growth, driven by continued strength in commercial HVAC. We expect Adjusted EPS in the first quarter to be between $2.15 and 2.20, with a midpoint of $2.17. This midpoint represents about 17% of our full-year guidance, ahead of our three-year and five-year historical averages of approximately 15% to 16. Overall, we believe our Q1 guidance is strong and an achievable start to the year. For additional details related to our guidance, please refer to slide number 18. Please go to slide number 12. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on deploying excess cash to maximize shareholder returns. First, we strengthen our core business through relentless reinvestment. Second, we maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure flexibility as markets evolve. Third, we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nOur approach includes strategic M&A to enhance long-term returns and share repurchases when the stock trades below intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 13. In 2024, we deployed or committed approximately $2.5 billion through our balanced capital allocation strategy, with approximately $800 million to dividends, $470 million to M&A, and $1.3 billion to share repurchases. We made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions, enhancing our AI and digital building management capabilities, expanding specialized refrigerated transport, and making multiple channel investments. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach. In addition, with $6.2 billion remaining under repurchase authorizations, we have strong flexibility as our shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. For 2025, we expect to deploy between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in capital. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, balance sheet, and significant share repurchase authorization provide excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 15. We've already covered our transport market expectations in the Americas and EMEA on slide 10, so I'll keep my comments brief. While the Americas transport refrigeration markets have been more volatile in recent years compared to the five years preceding the 2020 pandemic, the long-term outlook remains strong. [AC] forecasts show an average of 44,000 trailer units per year over a 15-year period. For 2026 and 2027, [AC] projects mid-teens growth. The future looks bright, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. Please turn to slide number 16. In summary, we are well-positioned to deliver leading performance and differentiated shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond. Our uplifting and engaging culture, combined with our leading innovation and proven business operating system, continue to set us apart. I'm proud of our team's consistent track record of growth, including our standout performance in 2024.\nI truly believe our brightest days are still ahead. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit your questions to one and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you for the question. I wanted to ask on service with Q4 up low teens again. I think Americas was in the mid-teens in Q4, and service has now grown at a double-digit rate for the last three to four years. Dave, I know you typically talk about high single-digit service growth. I just wanted to get a sense for the outlook here and what's baked into this 2025 guide on service, which I know in the past you've said has usually lagged equipment by a couple of years. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Chris, how are you doing? Thanks for the question. Yeah, I'm so proud of our service business, just the growth rates that we've seen there. Chris makes me use a seven-year kegger on that, so that's where the high single digits come from. It's very high, high single digits. Look, we were up mid-teens or low teens, I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter, low teens for the full year. Our service business now, from a dollar basis, is $6.5 billion. Just tremendous growth that we're seeing there. If you think about our backlog, right, which is predominantly on commercial HVAC, predominantly applied, that's really where our service business was designed around our applied solutions. The more complex those solutions become, the more propensity for the OEM to do the service work.\nLook, we'll keep our guide at the high, high single digits, but think about $6.5 billion that's growing at a close to 10% rate per year. In the last couple of years, I've been in that double-digit range. As you said, it's a very resilient business, and I could tell you that we're operating very well there. It's part of our operating system, the cadence that we have there, and we're really hitting on all cylinders right now.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nNo, really, really appreciate that. Maybe turning over to the commercial HVAC equipment orders this quarter, high singles, a bit better than last quarter, low singles. Comp seems to be the same. I know there's always a lot of focus on data center, but you guys do, obviously, I think you talked to 13 or 14 commercial verticals. With that improvement, is that just project lumpiness? When you look across those verticals, do you see a positive rate of change across some of them? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat's a great question. Look, our order grade for commercial HVAC in the Americas was up high single digits. On a two-year stack, it's over 20%. On a three-year stack, it's over 30%. We continue to see tremendous growth in our commercial HVAC business. As far as the verticals, yeah, we track 14 different verticals, and we're seeing growth. Yes, we're seeing growth in data centers. It's been a strong vertical for us in the past. It's going to be a strong vertical for us in the future. We're seeing broad-based growth. If you think about it, I mean, the revenue for the Americas for the year was up over 20%, and we had growth in 13 of the 14 verticals. The only vertical that did not show growth was life science, and it's been challenged all year, but we're very optimistic about the future there.\nThink about that. We're showing broad-based growth, and you would expect that from Trane Technologies with the broad-based portfolio of products and services that we have. We didn't design our portfolio of products to serve a particular vertical. We designed it to serve the market, and that's exactly what we're doing. If you take that with our direct sales force with deep domain expertise, knowledge at both a technical level, and then within a vertical level, you could understand why we're being able to have this broad-based growth. We're very excited about what we're seeing in commercial HVAC. The team's performing very well, and the pipeline, too, is very, very strong. Obviously, we report orders, but the pipeline is what the team's working on, and that remains very, very robust.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nChris, I would add, think about our applied solutions, which impact many of those 14 verticals. Revenues in applied are up over 120% in the Americas commercial HVAC business over the last three years, and the EMEA business is up more than 90%. That is building an install base that then drives services. Think of that as a few years after the install base, the service revenues start to apply post-warranty period. That's largely in front of us. It is a very durable tale, as Dave described, and really excited that, again, applied serves multiple verticals.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys. Really, really appreciate that.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around the sort of organic sales guide through the year. I think a lot of investors would have expected maybe a slow start to the year and then an acceleration because of resi HVAC recovering from the pre-buy headwind and TK picking up a bit. Your organic growth guide looks very steady through the year, just a point less in Q1. Trying to understand, does that reflect not a big headwind from resi HVAC and TK in Q1, or does it just reflect some conservatism when we're thinking about the second half and the commercial HVAC sales growth?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hi, Julian. It's Chris. I'll start. Yeah, think about the first quarter, and I'll start with residential, right? Dave called out the pre-buy estimate that we had around $75 to 100 million. We expect that should largely impact the first quarter. It may extend beyond that, but right now, we're thinking that should largely impact the first quarter. Probably means residential is flat to slightly down in the first quarter. Transport markets, as you described, I mean, we're seeing them bottom out in the first half of the year, probably a bit under challenge here in the first quarter. I mean, we're seeing continued strength in the commercial HVAC businesses. Think of them as up high single digit, could be 10% growth here even in the start of the first quarter.\nIt's really why we have a range of 6% to 7 organic revenue growth for the first quarter. We think the guide's in the right range. We've got opportunities, and multiple ways to get there. You're right. I mean, transport, residential, it may have a start that could be a little bit down at the beginning of the year, but a lot of strength coming through commercial HVAC. We have multiple opportunities as we execute to the guide on the full year, as we said, with 7% to 8 organic revenue growth. A lot of confidence in our guide for the first quarter and for the full year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much. My follow-up would be around the price sort of volume outlook within the organic sales guide. I think fourth quarter price was sort of 1% to 2 across the company, higher than that in the Americas. When we're thinking about the year ahead, is it sort of a similar 1% to 2 price tailwind in the sales mix? Any sort of concerns about customers, for example, in the Resi channels pushing back on price increases?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. For the fourth quarter, price was a little bit above two points. It really has been coming down over the last couple of years. Now, for the full year in 2024, it was a little bit above two points as well. The Americas would be really the driver there, a little bit above two points in the Americas. Julian, for 2025, we'd expect pricing to contribute about 1% to maybe 1.5% on the full-year revenue growth outlook. On 7% to 8, we'd get 5.5% to 6, 6.5% around volume, and then 1% to 1.5 coming from price. It's less of the carryover from 2024 pricing that would impact 2025, just given the low nature of the contribution in 2024.\nIt's really around the new price increases that we put in place for 2025. On residential, you mentioned that. Just to be clear on the transition to the lower refrigerant, the R-454B refrigerant for us, we're going to report that price increase, which is high single digits for that portfolio. We're going to report that in volume, so that would not be part of price. Think of that as on 65% of the portfolio, and then about 75% of the year, three-quarters of the year really being impacted by that transition for the A2L Refrigerant. Hopefully, it gives you a sense. We're probably in that one to one and a half point price range for the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you doing?\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? David, Chris, I wanted to ask Chris's question in a slightly different way. I know you have the 14 verticals, but are data center project bookings set to lead growth, for instance, in 2025 versus 2024? It seems like education-related bookings are holding up well. There's been some consternation about that. Just on the comps issue, comps in North America seem like they continue to get a little more difficult. Can you still grow commercial HVAC bookings in North America even against difficult comps?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, lot there, Andy. Look, we saw growth in, like I said, almost all verticals. Data centers were strong, but we had a lot of other verticals that were very, very strong. You've hit on one, education. Education has been strong. Certainly, ESSER funding was a tailwind there. Even in the fourth quarter, where ESSER funding is now, at least from an order standpoint, behind us, we still saw growth in fourth quarter bookings. I would tell you the pipeline there in education is very, very robust. As far as do we think there's opportunities that comps get hard, we still believe there's tremendous opportunities here for growth in all verticals, right? If you think about the megatrends around decarbonization and energy efficiency, they continue to intensify.\nIf you think about reshoring activity in the United States, that continues to intensify. If you think about the multi-year CapEx cycle with mega projects, that continues to have momentum. We're very bullish on our commercial HVAC business. I would tell you that the portfolio of products, and the innovation that we have there, I said in my prepared remarks, we are green for green. When you have a solution that's very sustainable for the planet and has a great payback for the customer, it's a great place to be. That's what we have at Trane Technologies. I'm very bullish about the future.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVery helpful, Dave. Just focusing on margin, APAC margin was obviously surprisingly strong in Q4. Maybe just comment on the durability of those margins in 2025. I think your incremental margin dropped a little in Americas and EMEA in Q4. You mentioned transport mix. Is that really what it is? You also talked about investments quite a bit. Could you quantify how much they were and what you're thinking for 2025?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andy, I'll start. I'll start with Asia. Yeah, we expected sequential improvements in Asia in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and our team in Asia just has even outperformed those expectations. It's still going to take some time to continue to normalize in China the tightened credit policies. That'll probably extend into the first half of 2025. Their decisions were the right decisions, and you're seeing that come through on sequential improvement versus what we saw in the third quarter. Margins, look, that team has just been outstanding in terms of managing their productivity, their investments, and ultimately still investing in the business. Let's see where margins go for going forward.\nThey're certainly leading margins across the regions, and it gives us a lot of confidence that EMEA and Americas can continue to grow their margins into the future as well, given just to recall our Asia business, it's largely commercial HVAC that they're selling into the region. For the other markets, very strong results in terms of margin expansion. We're driving all of those businesses for 25% or better leverage into 2025. We like that framework. The last couple of years, actually, we've taken the lid off of investments. We're making sure that we can drive strong leverage, and also accelerating as many investments as we can. That's really across all three of our regions. Otherwise, I think that hopefully answers the question. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to grow the margins, and really the leverage with the investments we're making.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll just add that, look, I'm super proud of the team in Asia. I know Asia, it's only 8% of our revenue, 50% of that's China, 50% outside the rest of Asia. I mean, just great performance. I mean, the rest of Asia had 10% growth, and it had order growth in the high teens, so very strong performance there. As Chris commented, the team in China just executed very well implementing our new credit policy, and the credit tightening is the right reason. That was the right prudent thing to do. I was very clear on the third quarter, if we don't have an order, we're not going to—if we don't have a down payment, we're not going to take the order.\nIn the fourth quarter, we made some adjustments to our backlog to make sure that everything in the backlog had down payments in it. That team is just executing at a very high level.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure, you're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning, guys. Dave, can you talk about the margin? Coming back to the service conversation at the front of the call, just to understand the margin opportunity in the service business over time. I know there's a lot of investments in technology to make technicians more efficient, maybe predictive maintenance. Hoping you could just speak to the runway there, just given, obviously, 1/3 of the business and the installed base is growing quite rapidly, and a few years from now, it could be quite larger. If you can talk about that.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's Chris. I'll start. Look, we like the margins in the service business. It's higher margins when you think about what we're delivering to customers and making sure that their products are running efficiently. As Dave's described in the past, the service business is rapidly evolving from running to go fix something that's not working effectively to now making sure that the equipment's always optimized, right? It may be running. You may think it's operating well, but the fact is it may be operating inefficiently. Therefore, that's a really nice opportunity for us. It gives us a lot of confidence that we should be driving organic leverage 25% or better. A reminder, services is a third of the enterprise revenues. It remains 1/3 of the enterprise revenues.\nYou're right, the investments that we've been making across our portfolio also include investments on our service portfolio. Think about service technicians, think about front-end tools, digital in terms of diagnostics. It's an area that, again, that's a great area to take the lid off and keep investing in that part of our portfolio.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, one of the things that we announced in Q2 was the closure of an acquisition, BrainBox AI. That's really going to help our service business as well in the future. If you think about today, we have roughly 42,000 connected buildings. We have well over 2 million connected assets. We're getting a lot of data at the building level and at the asset level. We'll call that structured data. What AI does is it augments that with unstructured data. When you combine that, that's really where you're able to make buildings operate more efficiently. Our service teams will be a big part of that in the future. I know you've probably heard me speak in the past about demand-side management.\nLook, we've done hundreds of thousands of energy audits, and we know that about 30% of the energy consumed after the meter is being wasted. Our goal is to help decarbonize that built environment and to get everything back to where it was designed to operate. If we could save that 30%, there's so much opportunity there well into the future.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nJust related to that, because obviously, paybacks are so compelling today, which is what's driving a lot of the growth. There is this expectation that power prices will continue to go up over the next several years. I guess the BrainBox acquisition probably allows the equipment to run even more efficiently. Can you just talk about how you think the payback map evolves over the next few years? The question you routinely get is, how long is it sustainable? If paybacks can actually improve, I wonder if just growth can actually re-accelerate.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think you're spot on. I don't think anyone's projecting that the cost of energy, or at least electricity, is going to go down in the future, right? You think of the paybacks, it's actually going to become more punitive if you're not running the system the way it was designed. The paybacks will actually increase. We think there's a tremendous opportunity in demand-side management, and we're executing to that strategy. BrainBox can be a big part of us. It's a small business today, but we've been really good at taking these technologies, in this case the technologies on the software side, and scaling it within our channels. We're really excited about the growth that we're going to see in the future from it.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How are you doing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood. Good. Congrats on a very strong year. Guys, I wanted to go back. I mean, you talked a lot about energy audits, and it just makes a ton of sense. It seems like that's kind of what drives the sales cycle. Do you measure internally the number of energy audits that you do kind of each quarter? Is there such a thing as kind of thinking about that as, I'll just call it, like front log, that energy audits are up X percent this quarter, and that gives you some additional confidence on the backlog or on the front log?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. No, it's a great question, Scott. Obviously, we have a lot built into our operating system around our energy management audits that we do. I won't disclose too much there, but absolutely, we track a lot of different metrics, and a lot of them are leading metrics, and that would be one of them. We track a lot of others as well. At the end of the day, when you're connected to an asset, you're going to make sure the asset is performing the way it was designed, and it's not wasting precious energy. When you show that to customers and they start to understand it, it becomes very compelling.\nWith the addition of not only the structured or machine learning data that we've been able to derive in the past, this unstructured data that we bring into the equation with BrainBox, it really, we're able to drive results that we didn't think were possible three or four years ago.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nDave, can you use AI now to do a digital twin meaningfully faster than you could in the past? Are we there? Are we at that point yet?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, we do a lot of work with digital twins. I'm not sure if you saw it when you went to 55 Water Street because I think we demonstrated one there. The speed is always getting better in the tools that we're using. Obviously, we're using all the tools that we have available to us, and AI is one of those tools. There are other tools as well that have really sped up that process. When you can see it visually and you see the digital twin and then you see the before and after, it's very, very compelling for the customer to understand the impact that we're able to have by constantly monitoring the equipment and constantly making sure it's at the peak performance levels.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Best of luck this year, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Scott. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you?\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOh, doing great. Thanks, Dave. For better or for worse, your stock at times tends to trade with the sentiments surrounding AI, CapEx, and data centers. I guess just maybe as you think through the trajectory of your data center business from here, maybe just give us some color on how you think that you expect that to progress. Also, just on your commercial HVAC backlog, are you still well above normal on that backlog in terms of how long cycle it is, or is it starting to normalize?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Why don't I start with the backlog, then I'll get to the data center question. Look, our book-to-bill in 2024 was over one. It was 102%. Our backlog year-over-year is relatively flat. It's down a little bit. What everyone needs to understand is we had a couple of adjustments that occurred within the backlog, right? There are really three. One is currency worked against us all year. Two is I've been very clear in Asia, specifically in China, that if we don't have a down payment, we're not including something in our backlog. We adjusted that out of our backlog. The third is the normalization of our transport businesses, which have been under pressure all year. That accounts for about a half billion dollars of backlog adjustments that we took in the year.\nIf you think about it, our backlog would actually be up year-over-year versus what we're reporting right now. That said, our backlog is very, very elevated, which gives us a lot of visibility into 2025. That's why Chris and I could speak with so much confidence about the guide that we're putting forward. It gives us great visibility. The other thing that we track a lot of is the pipelines, and these are orders before they become orders. That activity remains very, very robust. As far as data centers go, look, data centers have been a strong vertical for us for decades, and they'll be a strong vertical for us well into the future. As far as the news about a new competitor coming out of China and the impact that will have, we'll see. I can't comment on that.\nI could just comment on what we're seeing right now. We're seeing a lot of growth in data centers, and we're seeing a lot of pipeline activity in data centers. I had the opportunity to listen to the earnings call from Meta last night. If you listen to them, they would say that they're building out their infrastructure, and that's part of a competitive advantage that they have. It doesn't appear as though they're going to be slowing anything down. We'll wait and see. Everyone needs to understand that we're much more than just data centers. Data centers are strong. They've been strong in the past. We're really good in that vertical, but we're really good in 13 other verticals that we track very, very closely.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's super helpful, and bless you to whoever's new to the background. The quick question follow-up there is just maybe just a tariff question. Any comments on how you see this playing out, and any thoughts on your potential exposure there?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, good question, Joe. Look, for decades now, we've had a manufacturing strategy of in region for region. You think about in the Americas, we have a plant in Mexico, we have over 20 plants in the United States, we have plants throughout Europe, and we have plants throughout Asia, some in China, some outside of China. In the past, we've dealt with tariffs. Should they happen, we'll react. Do I think they could impact our supply chain? For sure. There's a little bit of flexibility there, but they will have an impact. I think part of our operating system is we understand our cost inputs, and if we see something change, we're going to react, and we're going to act very quickly to make sure that we stay margin neutral over time.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood. Always interesting times. I guess just on this RESI guide, roughly, I do not know, 4%-ish on the mixed benefit, which you'll call volume, a 1.5%, maybe 2% headwind from pre-buy. This is all annual. What are you thinking about the market on a volume basis this year, just from an underlying demand and replacement events perspective, if you will?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Steve, it's Chris. Yeah. You're right. There are three elements that really come into the guide of around mid-single-digit revenue growth for residential. The first one would be that mixed tailwind from the A2L refrigerant change, right? You can think of that as maybe around 4 points. High single-digit price on 65% of the portfolio multiplied by, say, three-quarters of the year impact gets you to around 4 points. The view around a GDP-plus framework would be the second element. Think of that as maybe 3 to 4 points of growth from returning to GDP. IRA tailwinds, right? That money is at the state level, and it's really starting to be deployed. That could be a tailwind for 2025. Items around consumer confidence, tax cuts, those are all things that could be beneficial to a GDP-plus framework for the year.\nThe third element would be that pre-buy dynamic, which is probably around 3% of a headwind. Altogether, you get into that 4% to 5-ish range on growth, which is our guide for the year around residential. To be fair, if it turned out that things were softer in the markets and it was not necessarily growth, but it was flattish, really the impact to our enterprise revenues would be less than a point. It would be 70 or 80 basis points, and we really feel comfortable. We have got that, and it is manageable within our guidance for the year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, that makes sense. What are you guys seeing in light commercial? What's your expectation for the year on light commercial?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We certainly think applied markets are going to grow faster than the unitary markets will for 2025. We'll see where it plays out. The best thing about Trane Technologies is we've got the broadest portfolio of products. Unitary versus applied, it's harder and harder to kind of figure out what the need for the customer is. We're looking at a solution, and many of those solutions will involve multiple products to ultimately deliver the energy savings that they need. Let's see. Probably more growth in applied for 2025 than unitary.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Sorry, one last thing. Given services is such a topic. Dave, you said like 8x to 10, I think, the multiplier on services. That just seems like a big number for an asset that has, I don't know, a 30-year useful life that basically people are spending that much money every three years to service. Is that really considered an annuity, or is that more like every five years they do a major refurb or something like that? How visible is that revenue? It just seems like a really big number for a building guy or an equipment owner to spend relative to his initial buy.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Just understand eight to 10x over the life of the asset, right? The asset's going to add 30 years, and the asset costs $1 million. Think of it at $8 million in service over that time period. Yeah, I mean, there's the maintenance that happens. Obviously, at some point in the useful life, you tend to do renewals for it where you'll change out controls or make it run more efficiently just because technology continues to advance. We're very comfortable with that number. We've done a lot of analysis on that with installed base. I'm very comfortable with the eight to 10x over the life of the asset.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How's Connecticut, Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nIt's a little chilly. It's warmed up recently. Yeah, we're not needing any HVAC in the, well, we don't need any [AC]. We need some H. That's what we need.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou need a heat pump, Jeff. Go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah. Yeah. Hey, a lot of ground covered. Maybe a couple of nits from me. Just first on backlog, I think you include everything in backlog regardless of how far out it reaches. Maybe you could just give a little color on the backlog staging, what's deliverable in 2025, and how far out it does reach.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Jeff, it's Chris. I'll start. $6.75 billion of backlog at the end of 2024. Again, the majority of that, call it 90%, is going to be driven by commercial HVAC globally. Of that, it's going to be majority applied systems. That backlog, the majority of it will revenue in 2025. That's actually fairly consistent with how we've seen the backlog in terms of the growth over the last few years that the majority will turn in 2025. There'll be a small amount that'll push out into 2026. That's really at the customer demand, but the majority of that backlog will turn within 12 months.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, understand, Jeff, remember, we don't have services in the backlog.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nRight. Yeah. Majority doesn't mean 55%. It means 80% or 90% or something like that, it sounds like.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, it would be, yeah. It's not a tick above 51 or 50, but no. Yeah, absolutely right.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah. Could you just also, just really in the weeds on RESI, how do the two-step channel perform in the quarter versus your internal channels as we kind of think about all the pre-buy gyrations we went through here?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe pre-buy obviously happened in the two-step with our IWTs, independent wholesale distributors. Think of that pre-buy, that $75 to 100 million, Jeff, as between Q3 and Q4, all right? We don't think it was all in Q4. It's hard to tell because we're estimating. We think probably about 50% was in Q3, 50% of it was in Q4. We also think, as Chris said earlier, that the majority of that will be impacted in the first quarter. Some of it will probably go into the second quarter. We can give you guys an update on that when we get to that point.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. I'll leave it there. Good luck this year. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Lots of questions on services. Here's another one. I probably should know this, but what is the mix between predictive connected type services versus, I guess, transactional services where there's a phone call from a customer, where there's parts involved, etc.? Just wondering what that mix is. Does it matter? I mean, is there a growth differential? Is there a margin differential between connected versus transactional?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Yeah. It really doesn't matter. We haven't disclosed that, Nigel, for a lot of different reasons. We're strong in both. I mean, obviously, we want to encourage our customers to have agreements because we make sure that the assets, we do more maintenance to make sure that the assets are performing. Obviously, we're going to respond if we get just a cold call saying, hey, my system is down, can you help me? What we'll do is if that happens, the goal is to make sure that we try to sign that customer up for a more comprehensive service agreement over time.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Is there a margin differential between whether the contract versus more transactional?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll say no, but there might be one if it's a cold call, okay, depending on what's going on. We try not to, because if someone's in a dire need, charge them more. That's usually not a long-term way to grow a business. We try to be competitive in both, just because we want the customer for life.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. A question on BrainBox AI. It seems like it's quite a chunky deal. It looks like $3 million or so EV. Just wondering if you'd give any details on the size, growth profile, how you can really kind of really expand this business. A nerdy accounting question for Chris, I think. This sounds like a very sort of intangible heavy business. Just curious if the intangible amortization is coming down when we think about that step down in the Trane amortization from 15 years ago.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Nigel, I'll start with BrainBox AI. Less than $300 million from a purchase price. We had another meaningful acquisition that we closed on in the first week of January, like we did with BrainBox AI, actually over in Europe, acquiring one of our independent channels there, very similar to a strategy that we have in the US. Yeah, less than that from an EV perspective. Not dissimilar to Nuvolo in 2024 with an early-stage technology company. Has a lot of amortization expense. We're expecting that to happen in 2025 for BrainBox AI. It's part of the guide in terms of the FX headwind and the amortization from the newly acquired business. We'll have about a $0.20 negative impact on earnings, and we've got that incorporated in our guide. You're right. That's kind of the accounting rules around the acquisition.\nOn the accounting rules, going back to Trane, you're right. We start stepping down on the Trane amortization in 2025. It's around $25 million or $30 million of lower amortization expense. That's really being offset fully with the investments we made over the last few years in CapEx, and the rising depreciation that comes from that. We've also had a few acquisitions that have some higher amortization as well. In 2025, the net impact of that benefit from the Trane amortization is really offset and nil. Let's see this in 2026. It's a bigger step down in 2026 on Trane amortization. We'll update you then for next year. For 2025, it's really a neutral impact.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. As far as the growth rates go, Nigel, look, we're pretty excited about it. It's small today, but we like these technology companies that we could scale. We have 42,000 buildings, right? There's 42,000 potential customers that we already have the data on that we're going to start running algorithms against to understand what the impact could be with structured and unstructured data together. This is going to be exciting. Like I said, it's going to be a nice tail for our service business earlier.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nDoing real well. Thank you. Maybe we just circle back on the pre-buy. It seems like it was relatively uneventful, at least in terms of how you were positioned. If you just step back, anything that surprised you in terms of the demand, the timing? There's always this nuance about competitive positioning, who cuts over first. Kind of just the postmortem, was there anything that you'd call out in terms of what you were expecting or what didn't play out?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNot really, Deane. I mean, we said for a long time we thought it would be a modest pre-buy. It was. The team did a nice job of executing the changeover to the A2L Refrigerant. We're fully operational on R-454B product now. We have the capability of running mixed model lines in our factories, so we can support the aftermarket for R-410, which will be needed, but not a lot. I mean, it was pretty much as we predicted. The only thing I would say maybe a little bit different is we probably had more of the pre-buy in Q3 than we anticipated. I didn't realize it was kind of a pre-buy until we got into Q4. That would have been the only maybe oddity. It makes sense, though, too.\nWhy would you wait to the fourth quarter if you were going to do a pre-buy and you might not have product? We probably saw more in Q3 than I anticipated. Again, we're talking about relatively small numbers that really don't have a big impact on results.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood to hear. I also like hearing that you say R-410 is going to be around for a while because I will be a user of that, so.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWe'll help you out if you're available. If you have a Trane product, you probably won't need to have it worked on for a while. If you ever do.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood. It may happen to be one of your units, so that's good to hear. Just second question, just circling back on China and that whole tightening the credit, it seems to have played out exactly the way you said you would be getting the down payments and maybe some progress payments. When I hear about tightening credit, it also makes me think that you actually turned down some customers or maybe shying away from particular verticals. Has there been any selectivity going on maybe related to this credit sensitivity?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, at the end of the day, we call it tightening credit. What we're doing there is we're requiring down payments, right? We're requiring a down payment when the order comes in, and we're requiring an additional down payment before the order will ship. It's not specific to any one vertical or any one channel. That's just the rules of the game that we're operating with. The team is doing a nice job of educating our customers as to the why. We made nice progress in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We have some work in front of us in the first half of 2025. This is our new way of doing business in China.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. I appreciate that, caller. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Tommy. How are you?\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nDoing fine. Thank you. Chris, you called out early in the call that if we look at the first quarter earnings contribution as a fraction of the full year outlook you've provided, it's a bit higher than the average. I thought about it differently just given the transport and RESI headwinds in the first quarter. Is there something we're missing that changes as you go into Q2, Q3, Q4, or is it perhaps some conservatism just about what's longer dated here? Just help us triangulate there. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We wanted to call out, Tommy, that EPS, the percent of the full year guide, is around 17%. It's normally 15% to 16%. We are starting the first quarter a little bit ahead of that three-year and five-year average, which we just wanted to make sure everyone understood. It's a strong guide for the first quarter, and we have a lot of confidence in it. As you work throughout the year, the transport markets are going to be expected to be down in the first half. There's expected recovery starting in the second half of the year, roughly flattish, maybe ± low single digits for the full year, but growth in the second half. Really, what's exciting is the growth expectations for 2026 and 2027 in the transport markets in the Americas. We'll see how the year plays out.\nYeah, there's more of a headwind in the first half of the year from transport. Residential, the first quarter, a little bit more of a headwind from that pre-buy, right? We think that'll largely impact the first quarter. It may drip into the second quarter or beyond. We'll update as we go throughout the year. That'll really normalize, let's say, by the second half of the year. We'll see where growth is based on market conditions, and then the tailwind we're getting from the A2L pricing. Those are the two that would stand out to me. Maybe the third would be Asia. Again, that new business in China and our team, again, executing very well there. That could be a little more headwind in the first half of the year, much easier comps as you get into the second half of the year in Asia.\nI think those three would probably really be the dynamics I'd call out now.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nThank you, Chris. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the comment made on some recent investments in Channel. I just want to ask if there's anything more you can share there. Dave, I think you mentioned one investment in Europe. If there's anything you want to call out in terms of a strategy update there, please do. If this is same as before and just some opportunistic transactions, let us know that. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Look, we've been buying up our independence in our commercial HVAC business for a long time. These are great businesses, they've had great leaders, and it's opportunistic for us to buy them up. Nothing's changed there with our strategy. There's not a lot of them left, unfortunately, because they're great acquisitions, and they become accretive very, very quickly, like almost instantaneously. It's just more of the same. We just had one this time. It was actually in Belgium over in Europe.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, for January. Think of it as we've been 95%+ direct, and it's these last few percentage points of those independent channels that, when they're ready, we're ready to kind of fully bring them into the Trane business.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nThank you both. I'll turn it back.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks, Tommy.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Finance and Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As usual, we'll be available to answer any questions you may have in the coming days and, frankly, in coming weeks. We'll also be on the road in the next couple of months attending conferences and other things. We hope to see you in person very soon. Hope everyone has a great day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Trane Technologies Q2 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Adam, and I'll be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of time, please ask only one question and one follow-up question. I would now like to turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' Q2 2024 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zac, and everyone for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our differentiated financial results over time. Our purpose is centered on creating a more sustainable world, and our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. We're all seeing the dire effects of climate change, and governments, NGOs, and companies around the world are increasingly taking action. We're hearing a lot about the need to invest in renewables and green the grid. What we're not talking enough about is demand-side management. That's where Trane Technologies comes in. Most buildings operate up to 30% inefficiently. Through our leading-edge technical solutions, sophisticated controls, and AI, we can help our customers significantly reduce energy demand and emissions.\nOur relentless innovation, proven business operating system, and uplifting culture enable us to consistently deliver a leading growth profile, strong margins, and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet. Please turn to slide number four. In the Q2, we extended our track record of strong execution. Our global team delivered robust performance across the board, not only bolstering our outlook for 2024, but strengthening our visibility to another year of leading performance in 2025. Bookings continue to be exceptional, with healthy momentum into the back half of 2024 as our pipeline of projects continues to grow. Q2 bookings of $5.3 billion rose to an all-time high, up 5% from our prior high in the Q1 and up 19% versus the prior year.\nOrganic revenues were up 13% with strong execution through the P&L, delivering 23% adjusted EPS growth. Notably, we continue to reinvest heavily in our business and accelerate key strategic investments, further strengthening our competitive positioning for continued market outgrowth. Booking strength continued to be led by our commercial HVAC businesses, where we're seeing broad-based growth. In top growth verticals such as data centers, market projections call for an exceptionally strong multi-year CapEx cycle, and high levels of project complexity play to our unique strengths. The power of our elite direct sales force, deep customer relationships, and leading innovation will enable us to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead. As the leading applied solution provider, we are driving significant market outgrowth in the most attractive, high-growth verticals in commercial HVAC. As an example, Q2 revenues of our Americas applied solution are up approximately 90% on a three-year stack.\nWe estimate that our applied systems carry an 8 to 10x multiple of higher margin service revenue over the life of the equipment. We're also excited about the service opportunities that lie ahead. Our robust bookings momentum and exceptional backlog of $7.5 billion US dollars provide strong visibility into the remainder of 2024, and increasing visibility into 2025. Our backlog includes $2.8 billion US dollars for 2025 and beyond, which is the level of backlog we would historically see entering a new year, and we're only halfway through 2024. All in, we're confident in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which would deliver our fourth consecutive year of 20% or greater adjusted EPS growth. Chris will cover guidance in more detail in a few minutes. Please go to slide number five. In our Americas segment, our Commercial HVAC business delivered industry-leading performance. Bookings were up more than 20% in the quarter.\nRevenue was up mid-20s and broad-based across vertical markets, with equipment up more than 30% and services up high teens. In residential, the team delivered very strong results, with bookings up more than 30% and revenues up low teens. Turning to transport, the business performed as expected. Revenues were down high teens against a tough comp of more than 30% growth in the prior year. The two-year stacked growth was more than 10% and well ahead of the market, which was down mid-teens. Bookings were solid, up low single digits. In EMEA, commercial HVAC strength continues, with bookings up 20%. Revenues were also strong, up high single digits in the quarter, and up over 25% on a two-year stack. Our transport business performed in line with our expectations, with bookings and revenue both down modestly. Turning to Asia, results were in line with our expectations for the Q2.\nAsia-Pacific bookings were flat, while China bookings were up mid-single digits. Revenues were down low single digits on a tough prior year comp of 40% growth. We're pleased with our performance through the first half, and expect Asia-Pacific to have another solid year overall. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. This slide provides a snapshot of our performance in the Q2 and highlights continued strong execution, top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 13%. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were both up 140 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 23%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low teens and mid-teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investments and innovation driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth. Please turn to slide number seven. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization, and productivity that more than offset inflation and continued high levels of business reinvestment. In our Americas segment, we delivered about 14 points of volume and about two points of price.\nOur Americas commercial HVAC business again outperformed the markets and delivered very strong volume growth of more than 20 points. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our EMEA segment, we delivered about 4 points of volume and 1 point of price, with strong volume in our commercial HVAC business. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our Asia-Pacific segment, the team delivered 310 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion despite a mid-single-digit volume decline. Strong productivity and positive price realization more than offset inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. Our end market segment and business unit outlook is largely unchanged, with some notable exceptions in the Americas segment. First, our Americas commercial HVAC business delivered another very strong quarter of market outgrowth. While we've highlighted particular strength in key verticals, growth was again broad-based. Revenue growth on a three-year stack was extremely strong, up approximately 45% to 50 in both Q1 and Q2. With our continued positive outlook and exceptional backlog position, we expect three-year stack revenue growth to remain at this high range in the second half of the year. Second, our Americas residential business delivered stronger-than-expected growth in the Q2, in part driven by three factors: the EPA clarification on the refrigerant transition, the normalization of channel inventories, and a strong start to the cooling season. We now expect full-year revenue growth to be up mid-single digits.\nThird, in our Americas transport business, ACT has lowered their outlook for the 2024 transport markets to down mid-teens. Their expectation is for a much softer second half, which they project to be down more than 25%. We expect to outperform the transport markets in 2024. Looking to 2025, ACT projects approximately 15% growth as freight rates improve. Overall, the changes to our outlook in the Americas segment represent a significant net positive to our enterprise outlook for 2024, and gives us confidence in raising our full-year guidance. All other businesses performed largely as expected in the first half, and the outlooks for the year are unchanged. We provided additional details on the slide for your reference. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. Our initial 2024 guidance reflected targets that we believed would deliver top quartile performance on organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth for the full year. Halfway through, we're exceeding those objectives. Given our strong performance, positive outlook, and exceptional backlog, we're raising our organic revenue guidance to approximately 10%, 1.5 percentage points above the midpoint of our prior range of 8% to 9. We're also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.35 US dollars at the midpoint to approximately $10.80 US dollars, up from a range of $10.40 to 10.50 US dollars prior. With this updated guidance, we're poised to deliver our fourth consecutive year of 20% or greater adjusted earnings per share growth.\nWe continue to expect about 1 point of growth from M&A in 2024, with a negative impact of approximately $30 million US dollars to adjusted operating income for the full year, or a negative impact of about 5 points to reported leverage versus organic leverage. We also expect about 1 point of negative FX impact in 2024, effectively offsetting the point of growth from M&A. Net, organic, and reported revenue growth guidance for 2024 are the same at approximately 10%. There's no change to our organic leverage target of 25% plus for the year, consistent with our stated long-term target, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings of 100% or greater. For the Q3, we expect revenue growth of approximately 8.5% and adjusted EPS of approximately $3.15 to 3.20 US dollars. Please see page 17 for additional information that may be helpful for modeling purposes.\nPlease go to slide number 10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A, which further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide 11, and I'll provide an update on our 2024 capital deployment. Year to date through July, we've deployed $1.1 billion US dollars in cash, with $379 million US dollars to dividends, approximately $100 million US dollars to M&A, and $650 million US dollars to share repurchases.\nWe have $1.8 billion US dollars remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, providing us with strong optionality as our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. We continue to have an active M&A pipeline with potential value accretive opportunities to further improve long-term shareholder returns. For 2024, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion US dollars in cash. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 13. We discussed the transport markets in our outlook discussion on slide number eight, so I won't cover them again here. However, we've continued to provide this slide for your reference. Please turn to slide number 14. We operate our transport business for the long term, and while we're moving through a down cycle in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a trailer market rebound in 2025, up mid-teens, and forecasts continued growth through their 2029 forecast horizon. We have a diversified transport business globally, with opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system, and a world-class dealer network, we're well-positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to slide number 15. In summary, we are well-positioned to drive differentiated growth over time.\nOur leading innovation, proven business operating system, and unmatched culture enabled us to consistently deliver top quartile financial performance over the long term while continuing to reinvest in our business. We believe our best days are ahead. We have the team, the strategy, and the track record to deliver leading performance and differentiated shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I'd like to remind everyone to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please limit to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the organic sales growth guidance. Understand sort of some of the year-on-year dynamics. It can depend if we're looking at one, two, three-year stacks and so forth. Maybe it's easier to look sequentially. I think the guidance implies sort of flat sales in Q3 sequentially. Normally, they're up the last few years, sort of mid-single digits. In the Q4, I think, is implied down double digits sequentially. Recently, it's been down high single. Just wondered sort of from a sequential standpoint, anything in particular you're seeing, or it's more of just a sort of conservative kind of construct based off the multi-year stacks?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, good morning, Julian. This is Chris. I'll start. Yeah, look, we're happy with the guidance we just put forth and raised full-year organic revenue growth target to 10%, up 1.5 points from our prior guide. Think about the second half of the year as I'll start with commercial HVAC Americas. They're going to have a great year on a full-year basis. As I've talked about in prior calls, the comps versus 2023 are just tougher as you go into the second half of the year. As a reminder, a year ago, that business grew mid-teens in Q1, high teens Q2. In the second half of 2023, it grew in the low 20s to mid-20s, Q3 and Q4 respectively. It's going to have a great year. Think of that second half range. It's probably in the 10% to 12 range in growth.\nWhat's interesting, and we did the math on this, when you think about the first half of 2024 in that business, the three-year revenue stack is a 45% to 50 growth. It's actually the same when you look at the second half of the year in 2024 as well. It's a 45% to 50 revenue growth over the last three years. It looks really consistent when you think about it over the last several years, with a lot of dynamic markets, so to speak, and dealing with supply chain. They're going to have a great year. Think of transport second half of the year, as Dave called out in his comments. I mean, those markets are expected to be down further than what we even thought three months ago.\nACT has called those markets down in the mid-20s in the second half of the year. We expect that business to be down, but we expect to outperform on the full year. Residential, I'll leave it within the Americas, mid-single digit growth plan for the second half of the year. Could it be better? Yeah, maybe it could be better. It is a bit of a step down from the Q2, but we're cautiously optimistic about that space. We're very much in the middle of the cooling season right now. We want to really see where it plays out. Maybe I'll end there that we're really confident in the full-year guide. Could things get a little bit better in the second half? Maybe. We'll update you as we get to the call next quarter.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much, Chris. Just my second question on the operating margin outlook. You've got the higher investments that are sort of pushing the full-year up leverage into that mid-20s plus framework after a 30s number in the first half. Anything else we should be aware of for the second half in terms of that margin element? Maybe flesh out anything around mix, perhaps? I suppose if resi and transport are a bit softer, there's a mix negative. Anything else to highlight in terms of, say, price-cost tailwinds? Also, within commercial HVAC mix, anything moving around on applied versus the light side in the back half?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, good question. I think it's really less about mix of the businesses. When you think about performance last year and EBITDA margins across EMEA, Asia, and the Americas, very different mix of businesses. EBITDA margins were fairly consistent across all three of the businesses, actually Asia leading. If I think about the second half, this is really where Dave has continued to challenge all of our business units with advancing investments, right? We see it as, and have seen it for a very long time, with accelerating investments. As we see high returns on them, that's where I would call out maybe second half of the year. There's a bit of compounding effect of the investments that we began to ramp in the Q1 of this year.\nThose wind up being a little bit more costly in the second half, but all of them have really strong returns. We like the full-year guidance and confidence in 25% or better organic leverage. Let's see where the year plays out. The focus here is making sure we continuously and relentlessly invest in the business to keep driving this market outgrowth in the next several years. Dave's keeping the pressure on. I'm sitting here smiling at Chris as he's saying that, Julian. Thanks for the questions. We love investing in our business, and we've been able to demonstrate the results of the investments we've been able to make, and we expect more of that in the future.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Dave and Chris and Zac.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott, how are you doing?\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm good. Thank you. Today's results have been good, so it's been a good day. I wanted to just dig in a little bit on backlog, kind of your comments about 2x normal, and trying to just tease out what's changed here. Obviously, demand is solid. Are these backlogs 2x normal largely because lead times have gone up substantially, because these projects have gotten bigger and more complex, and folks want to get in front of the line? I'm thinking data centers and semi-fabs, things like that. Perhaps I'm overstating that a bit.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Scott. I would say that we should maybe challenge ourselves as to what's normal, okay? We're a lot bigger business than we were four years ago, obviously. Lead times, I wouldn't say that's the—I would say lead times are back to what I would call a normal rate. For data centers, for sure, we have data center customers that are providing us visibility to their needs well in advance than, say, maybe some of the other verticals. That's a part of it. Look, we're seeing tremendous strength, really, in almost all verticals. As we looked in the Americas in our commercial HVAC business in the quarter, I think we spoke before, we tracked 14 different verticals. It was hard for us to find a vertical that was down. We just have broad-based strength.\nWe certainly are seeing a lot of demand in the high-growth verticals like data centers, but we're also seeing nice demand in other verticals as well.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, helpful. China, the bookings are up. I know it can be a little bit lumpy for sure. Is there an indication that China has bottomed? I guess my question is kind of, A, on the macro side, but B, you guys probably getting some outgrowth, I would imagine there. If you have some color around that, B.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I'd say it's a good question, Scott. Look, Asia is less than 10% of the revenue for the enterprise, okay? Think of it as 50% China, 50% the rest of Asia. In the quarter, the region performed as we expected. Revenues were flat. I would tell you that we did see some choppiness in China towards the back half of the quarter. We have our eyes wide open on that. I would also tell you that we have that baked into our guide for the year. I wouldn't say that China has bottomed. We performed well there. Our team is executing at a very high level. We have a very seasoned team there. A lot of innovations in their pipeline there that they're rolling out into the marketplace. Just to be clear, getting orders in China are pretty dynamic right now.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Congrats, Dave. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks. Appreciate it, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Nice quarter.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy. Appreciate it.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nDave, just a little bit more about bookings and backlog momentum going forward. We know you have more difficult order comparisons coming up, could you maintain book-to-bill at or over 1x? The renewed momentum in Americas commercial HVAC, I know you just said it was relatively broad-based, including data centers. How long do you think this elevated bookings environment could last? At what point do strong orders give you confidence that 2025 should be another strong earnings growth year or even a double-digit growth year?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I'm not going to forecast our incoming order rates for the rest of the year. I will tell you that we're going to have a backlog that'll be very strong going into 2025, much like you saw us at the beginning of 2024. We already have $2.8 billion US dollars booked for 2025. I mean, that's a number that we haven't talked about, that size of a number, in the past. We're very confident there. As far as the demand that we're seeing, look, we're seeing a lot of demand. I emphasize it's broad-based, right? It's not just in the high-growth verticals, because we're very strong there, but it's broad-based. It really has to do with a lot of our innovation and our ability to execute. With our direct sales force, we go to where the opportunities are.\nOur teams are highly technical, and we're winning in the marketplace. It's that simple. I couldn't be prouder of what that team's been able to execute. By the way, we're talking a lot about the Americas, but I would tell you that our commercial HVAC business in Europe also performed extremely well. Their order rates were up 20%. You could see that investing in the business, always having that long-term vision as to where you want to go, and the payback that you get for that, this is a flywheel, as Chris would say. We're seeing the impacts of that, and that flywheel is going to continue to spin for us.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that. Yeah, I tried there to get you to forecast bookings, oh well. Let me then ask you a follow-up. Chris, you kind of alluded to resi and the strength that you're seeing. It looks like revenues in the first half were already up mid-single digits plus. Orders accelerate, obviously, in Q2, up 30%. I know you said you want to be conservative, but really, is mid-single digit growth the minimum for the year? What have you seen so far during the cooling season?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndy, good question. Yeah, I think mid-singles is probably the floor for the business. Could it be better? Yeah, we think it could be better. As you know, bookings in that business, it's less important. It's really around seeing through the entire cooling season. As you know, there's a refrigerant transition that's happening later into this year, into next year. We're ready for that. We can certainly answer any questions there as well. We've got a lot of confidence in that team. It's been a challenging market leading into this cooling season for about a year, year and a half. Yeah, we feel like, could that be better? It could be better. Let's see how the year kind of plays itself out.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Andy, as I said in our prepared remarks, look, three reasons why we did so much better in resi in the Q2. One is the clarification on the refrigerant transition. The second is certainly the inventory is at what we would call a normal level in the channel list through our independent wholesale distributors. The third is not that I like to talk about the weather, but it's been a very, very warm start to the cooling season, which should have us all concerned for a different reason that we could talk about if you'd like. It's been a very, very strong start. As Chris said, we're cautiously optimistic in this business. The team performed very well in the Q2, and it's a great start for that team.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations of any pre-buy given the A2L transition, and just, yeah, have you already introduced the product, etc.?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Gautam, good question. In our commercial business, we've introduced about half of the products that would be affected. Think about it, any product that uses a scroll compressor is a target for a refrigerant change, okay? Just in a broad brush. On our commercial side, it's about half of it we've introduced. We're actually selling both. We're selling 454B, the new refrigerant, as well as still 410. In our resi business, not yet. We haven't introduced it. That'll be rolling out in the back half of the year. As far as pre-buys go, look, we're not anticipating in our residential business a large pre-buy towards the end of the year. We'll see how that rolls out. Right now, we're not forecasting that.\nThere's just too much timing that you have to work on to make sure that you could sell through all your products in the year. Our focus really is on helping our independent wholesale distributors transition their inventory properly. We'll be working with them as the year progresses here to make sure that they're ready for the cooling season in 2025. That's really where our focus is right now. To answer your question, not a large pre-buy. At least we don't have one baked in. I would tell you that the way we designed our operations, we're able to manufacture both products.\nWe have mixed model lines, which it was a little bit more upfront cost, but we'll leave that investment we'll pay because, as you know, in the resi area, you'll be providing components of 410 for some time into the future to make sure that we could service our product over the useful life for that product.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Gautam. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDamian Karas\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning, Damian. How are you?\n\nDamian Karas\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nDoing well, thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat.\n\nDamian Karas\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nI was wondering if you could maybe help us unpack the 13% organic growth a little bit. Just give us a sense for how much of this top line is being driven by volumes versus some price and mixed benefits, and just maybe kind of walk us through how you're thinking about that for the full year now.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Damian, it's Chris. I'll start. Yeah, for the quarter, think of it as a little bit over 2 points of price. You'll see this in the 10Q that gets filed later today. About 11 points of volume. As we anticipated coming into the year, we knew that price was going to be a contributor, but less of a contributor than what we saw in 2022 and 2023. That's been dovetailing. The offset to that, and a nice offset to that, has been improved productivity. As kind of came out at the end of last year, middle of last year with supply chain challenges largely resolved, we're continuing to see improvements on the productivity side. If I step back, we're getting the right combination of price, dollars, and margin above inflation. It is inflationary out there, to be fair.\nIf I think about tier one costs with copper up, aluminum up to somewhat flat, steel down, refrigerants up, and ultimately wage inflation really being up, all of that is still going to be a bit inflationary on us for this year. I like where we are price versus inflation. The productivity is getting stronger, and making sure that we're funding the business with investments. It was another quarter of a high investment and continued high investment quarter with projects we think are very, very strong. That volume growth, the 13 points of, or I'm sorry, 11 points of volume on the 13 points of revenue growth. Think of that as 20 points of volume in commercial HVAC Americas. On price, where we were in the Q2, we're confident that gives us a lot of view into the full year. Price should be around 2 points as well.\nThat'll look a little bit lower in the second half of the year versus the first half, ultimately landing around 2 points on the full year. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of added color.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nA lot of volume, Damian.\n\nDamian Karas\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, not a bad thing. That was helpful, thanks. I wanted to see if you might be able to share some color on how things are progressing with some of your kind of early-stage emerging growth opportunities, if you will. Think of your investment in emerging cooling, your AI partnership. Would you envision these being potential capital deployment opportunities down the road?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, I'll answer the first question here. The emerging cooling, as I've said in the past, that's sort of a, that's got some hurdles it still needs to work through. We're working through some of that with our partner there. That's not what I would call mainstream. As far as the AI tools, like the Nuvolo acquisition we did, it's early days, but we really like what we see there. This is going to really help us accel our connected asset solutions. In my opening remarks, I talked about demand-side management, and we're not talking a lot about that. A lot of people are talking right now about the generation side of power. A lot of people are talking about all the demand that's coming. What people don't realize is that in a building, 30% of the energy that's consumed is wasted, right?\nIf you're connected to the asset, if you're connected to the building, you're able to ensure that that asset or that building is going to perform the way it was designed. This 30% number, I'd love to show you some of our stats, but this is a massive amount of energy that can be saved. We're really happy. We're really bullish on Nuvolo. We're really bullish on what we're doing with our connected solutions. I think you're going to hear a lot more about demand-side management in the coming years because it's not just about generation, and it's not just about forecasting all the demand that's going to be coming. You see a lot about data centers right now. It's like, how do we use what we're generating today in a more efficient way?\nThat's what we know at Trane Technologies we could help our customers with.\n\nDamian Karas\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks, guys. That's a lot.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Damian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Joe. Good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHow are you?\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nI'm going to touch on data centers again just quickly. I know that broad-based growth across commercial HVAC in the Americas. I'm just curious, though, are you seeing any constraints on your bookings for data centers? I know that that's been a hot topic of late. Also, can you just maybe tell us a little bit about the margin profile of the business that you're booking in that vertical?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI'll start. I'll let Chris talk about margins. Constraints from a capacity standpoint, no. I mean, we've made capacity expansions over the last several years, so we feel as though we're in good shape there. It's more about working with the customers. It's more about working with the system level within the data center. We're not just a component supplier within a data center. We look at the entire cooling system, whether you're cooling at the building level, the server, or the servers themselves. This is something that we're really good at, and we're very strong in this vertical, and we've been very strong in this vertical for a long time. I'll steal a bit of Chris's thunder here, but the margins in this space are very attractive, and we really like our service tail that this provides. Chris, you want to add anything?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat's where I was going to go, Dave. I think, again, these are generally highly customized applied systems when you're talking about data centers for the most part. While we're pricing for innovation, we're also making sure we've got customers for life. These are customers that are putting in multiple locations, multiple data centers, and we want to make sure we have not only a solution for today's order, but what that order can be a year, two years, five years from now, as all market projections would suggest that this is going to be a multi-year growth factor with the growth of data centers. With that, to Dave's ending point, the opportunity still in front of us is to think about services here.\nWith typical applied systems generating 8 to 10x of the revenue and services from a dollar of equipment, that's still an opportunity well in front of us as we deploy products into this space. You're starting to see that a bit in the revenues, but more of that in 2025 and 2026. That's a nice opportunity still in front of us.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's helpful, guys. Just my quick follow-up. resi HVAC growth this quarter was much better than what some of your other public peers have reported so far. It looks like you took some share. I was just wondering, was there any disruption that you noticed with any of your public or non-public comps in the quarter? I know, Dave, you referenced some of the reasons why you grew this quarter, but I'm just thinking the growth was surprisingly good.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, the team executed very well. Look, I've been saying for a long time, Joe, you got to look at the share in residential over a longer period than just a quarter. Did you do better in a quarter? Tell me what you've done over the long term. I can't comment on whether there was any one of our other competitors that didn't do well. I don't know that. I am very pleased with our results. We're cautiously optimistic here. Look at share over the long term. Don't just look at it on a quarter. There are different sell-in models, and you get the wrong answer if you just look at a particular quarter. I am very happy with the results that we've been able to demonstrate.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, guys. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. You guys getting bored yet of putting up these kind of results?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSteve, I never get bored of putting up great results. It's the flywheel that Chris talks about, right?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah, congrats on great execution and very strong results. Could we just get a breakdown of the difference between applied and unitary equipment in the quarter, and then what you're expecting for the second half in those two?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Steve, I'll start. Happy with performance in both of those businesses with applied and unitary. I'd say both up strong. We talked about commercial HVAC revenues up over 20% in the quarter, and both contributing to that. Equipment was up 30%. Maybe unitary a bit stronger than applied, but not by much. Second half of the year, think of our—I’ll start with commercial HVAC Americas. Think of that all in about up 10% to 12 in the second half. I described earlier great performance last year in terms of tougher comps with the growth in revenue from, call it, mid-teens in the Q1 of last year to mid-20s by the Q4 of last year. That team's going to have a great year this year. We're even more excited about 90% of the backlog is commercial HVAC.\nThe $2.8 billion US dollars that Dave spoke about that we already have for 2025 and beyond, that's all equipment. We don't have service in that backlog, and that's all commercial HVAC. It's going to be a really strong follow-on to this year, and it's giving us a lot of confidence for growth going into next year. Hopefully, that kind of answers the question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nWill these diverge in the second half? I mean, it seems like, obviously, with the data center stuff, the applied business and the backlog-related business is continuing to grow really strongly. The more short-cycle stuff maybe slows a bit given the tougher comps. Is that how we should think about it? Will they diverge a bit, unitary and applied?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nI don't know if they'll diverge a bit. I mean, with unitary maybe being up a bit more in the Q2, I think they're going to be somewhat close to each other here in the second half. Services is going to be strong for the second half as well. We're tracking, as we saw in the Q2, and Americas business was up high teens. Enterprise was up mid-teens. That's going to be a nice contributor to the second half as well. I wouldn't say that there's going to be a big divergence in the second half.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I would agree with Chris. I think that— Sorry. Steve, I think that, again, when you talk about broad-based growth, right, different verticals are satisfied with different types of products.\nIn this broad base that we continue to demonstrate results in, you could see that we're growing both applied and unitary. Not that we look at the business that way because we're really selling systems. Our unitary, as Chris said, we were actually stronger in unitary in the Q2 than we were applied, despite the fact that we have very large backlogs in applied.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOne last question for you just on the services growth. I mean, usually think of services being pretty solid growth, but more stable. These types of growth rates in services, obviously very strong. Credit to you guys. What is the key driver here? It seems like it's more than just a run rate of recurring break, repair, stuff like that. Is there anything that's standing out? Because it just seems these types of growth rates, they're not lumpy, but they're just seemingly way higher than what you would consider to be a nice, steady services business.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's a great question, Steve. Appreciate you noticing our high growth rates there. Just to remind everyone, we've had a compound annual growth rate over the last six years of high single digits. In the Q2, we were up mid-teens, right? I'll just go back to our operating system, right? It's a system of things that makes our service business great. For sure, it helps when you keep growing your applied installed base because our service business is really built around our applied installed base. I would also tell you that the mindset that we have of an asset is not performing when it's not heating or cooling properly and/or it's using too much energy is a different way to think about it. There's a lot of growth potential when you start thinking that way. Think of our answer.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. Yeah, thanks a lot.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, Steve. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey. Hope everybody's well. I wanted to come back to data centers too. Maybe a little bit bigger picture, just kind of competitive and customer kind of behavior question. Obviously, you and your peers are talking about very strong growth. It seems like there's plenty to go around. It also does look like you're probably outgrowing them, but it's hard to tell. The nature of my question is, are your customers in general and maybe the hyperscalers in particular standardizing on OEMs? You end up dominating hyperscaler A and Carrier as hyperscaler B, or are we looking at mixed fleets based on what people can deliver at a point in time? Just give us a sense of, in this almost kind of gold rush to stand this stuff up, just how the competitive landscape and customer behavior is unfolding.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'd say hyperscalers, first of all, they like technology, and they like always pushing the envelope, trying to increase the efficiency of the system. They're always working with us, and they may be working with our competitors as well to make sure that we can have a more efficient system tomorrow. We have a lot of cool things that we're working on there with them. Some of it includes things that are maybe a little bit outside of that, which is the heat recovery side of things, which I've talked about in the past. Look, at the end of the day, these hyperscale customers like resiliency as well. They'll typically pick a prime, and then they'll pick a secondary. That's just prudent behavior on their behalf.\nWe've seen that before, but I would tell you they really, really, really like innovative technologies.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nDave, is there a way to think about just kind of your available served market here, dollars per megawatt deployed or some other metric as you try to really kind of game plan for the capacity you need and the revenue trajectory you might be looking at? Any way you could kind of help us frame that?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWe have some internal models that I won't share with you the results. Look, it's allowed us to be able to help forecast based on talking to our customers, understanding what their demands are, okay, and then kind of pushing that back into, well, what would it mean for us? I would tell you that think of units getting bigger, think of units getting more complex, and think of added features on units like heat recovery. That's certainly a trend that we're seeing, and that's certainly something that we're working with our customers, kind of pushing into the marketplace.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Great call.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHow are you?\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nObviously. Yeah. Good. Thanks. Look, everything's really good. I'm going to focus on a couple of areas that aren't so great right now. Dave, in a world of down 15% trailer declines this year and after, how does TK Americas perform? Maybe just on top of that, add in how the other verticals are performing, bus, rail, etc., and spare parts.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's a fair question. Look, the Americas transport business is going to be down in 2024. It's a more cyclical business than our commercial HVAC business. ACT is projecting the back half of the year to be down 25%. To be fair, our internal models say it could be down even a little bit more than that. That's what we have baked into our full-year guide. I had the opportunity early in my career, Nigel, to run this business. I would tell you that I've seen these downturns in the past. I would tell you that these markets will come back. Right now, it's projected they'll come back in 2025. We'll stay tuned on that. This is a very strong business, and when these markets come back, they're going to come back strong.\nThe key is to continue to invest in the business when you're in this down cycle. When you do that, when the markets come back, you're able to delight your customers with a whole portfolio of innovation that really allows you to win through that cycle. That's what our plan is right now. As Chris said, we've been investing heavily in the business. We're not stopping that. TK is a big part of those investments that we're making. I'm excited about the innovation pipeline that's going to come out in the Thermo King business. When the markets come back, we're going to be ready. As far as the other businesses, I mean, they tend to follow trailer. I mean, trailer is the big one, but they tend to follow that same cycle.\nIf we start to get freight rates to improve, if we start to get capacity coming out of the channel, we'll see the market start to rebound. I know they will, so.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, they certainly will. Absolutely. Would down mid-to-high teens be reasonable for TK Americas in the back half of the year?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Nigel, this is Chris. Yeah, I think they could be down mid-single to high single in the second half of the year. I mean, we expect it to be down probably in the range of low double digits on the year if trailer markets are down. Mid-teens, we expect to outperform. That is the innovation and the investments we've had in this business for many, many years. The key here is to make sure that while it is a down year and we're going to manage the decrementals as so far we have, we expect to do that for the balance of the year. It's making sure that we've got the investment pipeline that continues to run in the business.\nJust in June, we finished our long-range plans for each of our business units, thinking about capacity, and not only in commercial HVAC, but all of our businesses. This is one that we like, these markets, to Dave's point. We want to make sure we're still investing so that when the markets do recover, we're ready. Could the market be down more than mid-teens? I mean, that's what we've called it right now. To be fair, I know ACT has had multiple revisions here over the last several months. I think it's four or five this year already. Our internal models would suggest maybe it's down a little bit more than that, so we're making sure we bake that into our guide at this point.\nSecond half of the year, we expect it to be down on down comps from a year prior, but we do expect to outperform the market.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, guys, I had a follow-up question, but that was a great answer. I'll leave it there. Thanks, Lucas.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI'm doing real well. Thank you. Just want to circle back on unitary. One of your competitors this quarter talked about making a push into the emergency replacement of unitary into that market where they said they really don't have any share. How might the competitive dynamics change here? Any of the economic returns? Just any comments from you would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat's a tough one for me to answer. I'm not sure what they're planning on doing. I would tell you that we're very strong in unitary as far as the replacement market goes. Yeah, in the heat of the summer, if the unit stops working, it needs to be replaced. Having the available unit on hand is very, very important. We carry a lot of inventory stock, and we also have, with our lean thinking in manufacturing, quick ship programs, which allows us to really win in this space.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIs it fair to say that the emergency replacement market is basically half of the business today, or is that overstated?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I can't comment on that. I think it would really depend on the time of year, okay? You also have a planned replacement market as well. There's a lot of things that are part of that statement that you just made. It really depends.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAll right. No, I understand. That's helpful. Second question, any updates on all of the mega projects? Are you seeing any bidding coming through? Any updates would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I mean, we continue to track mega projects. As I've said in the past, mega projects tend to be in verticals that we were always strong in. It's hard to say what's incremental in that space. Right now, our teams are tracking over 300 projects. Some of them have been closed, but many of them are still in the pipeline. One of the things about these mega projects is they tend to have lots of different decision-makers, especially in the semiconductor space. I mean, I'll give you an example. We had a project where the decision-maker was in Asia, the engineer was in Seattle, Washington, and the mechanical was in Austin, Texas. One of the advantages that we have with our direct sales force is we could really help the customer triage all the information that's required.\nIt allows us to really be focused on the customer needs, but also all the different individuals that are part of that process. We really like our positioning with these mega projects, and a lot of these mega projects are very sophisticated engineered products, which actually plays to our strength as well.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure, Deane.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYeah. Thanks. I'll just ask one question. David, it goes back to your opening comments around demand-side management as an underappreciated lever here. You're sitting on one of the largest flexible capacity assets on the grid, and you're expanding your ability to play in distributed resource management, virtual power plants, and district heating. I was hoping you could maybe connect the dots for us a bit more and just frame up how meaningful this is becoming in terms of some of the commercial HVAC bookings and revenue trends, how much they expand your wallet share, anything you can do to help quantify for us some of these additional facets of the business.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, I appreciate the question, Noah. I think we're still in the early innings on this. I know we're in the early innings. It's more about an education process. We were working with a customer, a large customer in New York City, and we created a digital twin for their particular building. We were connected, and we were watching the energy consumption. We saved that particular customer. I mean, it may not sound like a lot, but it was like $120,000 US dollars, right, in energy that they would have wasted if we weren't connected to their solution. You think about the universe, okay? If you think about the commercial space at 400 billion square feet, I mean, it's crazy the opportunity that exists. Well, this is a massive opportunity. Demand-side management, you're going to hear a lot more about it.\nThe neat thing about it is you don't have to wait for new technology to be developed, right? This is technology that's readily available. Being connected from a structured data standpoint, which we've been for a while, but now we're adding in unstructured data with our AI tools, we're able to really dial in algorithms to really help our customers save energy, which is saving carbon, which is good for the planet as well.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay, thank you. We'll look forward to hearing more.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Noah.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be around for any questions that you may have. Feel free to ring us up. In the coming months, we'll be on the conference circuit, obviously, and we'll hope to see some of you on the conference circuit as well. Thanks for joining, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Trane Technologies Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brianna, and I'll be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and thanks everyone for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our engaging, uplifting culture, and enables our differentiated financial results over time. Our purpose is centered on creating a more sustainable world, and our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Customer demand continues to increase as the need to address climate change becomes more urgent. We need creative solutions and game-changing innovation to bend the curve on global warming, and that's where Trane Technologies leads. Our relentless innovation, proven business operating system, and high-performing culture enable us to consistently deliver a leading growth profile, strong margins, and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet. Please turn to slide number four.\nIn the first quarter, we extended our track record of strong execution. Our global teams delivered robust performance across the board. Quarterly bookings of more than $5 billion US dollars were at an all-time high and up 17% organically. Organic revenues were up 14%. Adjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 38%. First quarter booking strength was again led by our commercial HVAC businesses globally, which were up over 20%, with growth of more than 30% in equipment and mid-teens in services. Bookings in our Americas commercial HVAC business were once again a standout, up 30%, with more than 40% growth in equipment and more than 15% in services. Booking strength was broad-based, with growth in nearly all vertical markets.\nWe delivered exceptional bookings growth across our applied solutions, leveraging the power of our direct sales force, deep customer relationships, and leading innovation to capitalize on increasing project complexity in high-growth verticals. Our commercial HVAC pipeline remains robust around the world, and we see tremendous growth opportunities well into the future. Our strong growth profile provides us with excellent optionality to accelerate key investments in 2024 while delivering strong leverage, EPS, and free cash flow. We put a number of high ROI investments in flight in the first quarter. With a focus on future growth, these investments include product innovation, increased capacity, sales and service excellence, digital, and automation. Our bookings performance further strengthens our position for 2024 and increasingly for 2025.\nQ1 ending backlog of $7.7 billion US dollars is up 10% from year-end 2023, and we increased our backlog for 2025 and beyond by $800 million US dollars to a total of $1.8 billion US dollars, increasing visibility to future growth. Based on our Q1 results and expectations for continued strong performance, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. Chris will cover the details in a few minutes. Please go to slide number five. Demand for our innovative solutions continues to be exceptional, with a book-to-bill of 120% on strong organic revenue growth of 14%. In the Americas segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered strong performance across the board. Bookings were up 30% in the quarter and up over 60% on a three-year stack, led by our applied solutions portfolio, which we estimate carries an 8 to 10x multiplier of higher margin services revenue over the life of the equipment.\nBacklog for applied solutions continues to grow, which bodes well for future growth. Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-20s, with more than 35% growth in equipment, and mid-teens growth in services. The compounding of services revenue year after year provides strong growth in good times, and is resilient in more challenging macro conditions. We're investing heavily in sales and services excellence programs to strengthen our business for the long term. Turning to residential, bookings were down low single digits, and revenues were up low single digits. The business performed stronger than our initial expectations for Q1, and we're cautiously optimistic moving forward. Our transport businesses performed as expected, with bookings down low single digits, and revenues down mid-teens.\nWhile we see the down cycle in transport as modest overall, the business is facing tough comps from 2023: a +20% growth comp in the first half and a down 20% growth comp in the second half, which impacts the optics in the near term. Net, in 2024, we expect to see a soft first half and a strong second half. Turning to EMEA, the region performed in line with our expectations. Commercial HVAC bookings and revenues were strong, up low teens and up high single digits, respectively, while transport bookings and revenues were down low single digits. The book-to-bill was very strong at approximately 120%. Turning to Asia, the team delivered strong performance consistent with our expectations for the quarter. China remains very strong, with bookings up more than 20% and revenues up high teens. Asia's book-to-bill was also very strong at approximately 120%.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. This slide provides a snapshot of our performance in the first quarter and highlights strong execution, top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 14%. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up 200 basis points and 230 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 38%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in equipment and services, both up low teens. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investments and innovation driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth. Please turn to slide number seven. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization, and productivity that more than offset inflation.\nIn our Americas segment, we delivered about 12 points of volume and about 3 points price, with our Americas commercial HVAC business delivering very strong volume growth of approximately 20 points. Strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by strength in our commercial HVAC business, which more than offset the expected impact from revenue decline in our transport business. In our EMEA segment, we delivered about 3 points of volume and about 1 point of price, with stronger volume in our commercial HVAC business. Adjusted operating margins were up 30 basis points for the segment, and stronger when you consider the impact of acquisitions and FX in the quarter. Excluding FX currency losses related to the devaluation in the Egyptian pound in the quarter, EMEA EBITDA margins would have been 19.5%. The Asia segment delivered mid-teens revenue growth almost exclusively from higher volumes.\nStrong volume, productivity, and modest price contributed to 310 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. We reinvested heavily back into each business in the first quarter, and expect to ramp these investments through the year to drive growth well into the future. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. Our end market segment and business unit outlook is largely unchanged from our Q4 earnings call, with a couple of notable differences. First, our Americas commercial HVAC business had a very strong quarter, stronger than we expected, despite a tough comp of mid-teens revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023. We're encouraged by the strong start for the business, especially when you take into account the exceptional 30% bookings growth and 125% book-to-bill ratio on mid-20s revenue growth in the quarter. We expect the Americas commercial HVAC business to remain strong throughout 2024 versus increasingly tough comps from 2023 as we move throughout the year. Second, our residential business performed stronger than we expected in the first quarter.\nWe expected the business to be down modestly on continued destocking, and we believe the EPA clarification on sell-through helped to mitigate some of the independent wholesale distributors' concern heading into this season. While we're pleased with the results, the first quarter for residential is typically a very small percentage of the year and doesn't provide a sufficient read-through to the balance of the season. We believe it's prudent to move through Q2 and gain more visibility before extrapolating too much from Q1. All other businesses performed as expected, and the outlook for the year is unchanged. We provided additional details on the slide for your reference. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. Our initial 2024 guidance reflected optimism about key end markets, and our ability to outperform.\nWhile we're only one quarter in, our exceptional bookings, revenues, and backlog in our commercial HVAC businesses strengthen our conviction that 2024 will be another year of robust top-line and bottom-line growth. We're raising our organic revenue guidance by 2 percentage points to 8% to 9% from 6% to 7% prior. We're also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.30 US dollars at the midpoint and raising the low end of our guidance range above the high end of our prior guidance range. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is narrowed to $10.40 to 10.50 US dollars, up from $10.00 to 10.30 US dollars prior. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in relentless high levels of business reinvestment to drive end market outgrowth, healthy leverage, and strong free cash flow.\nWe expect to see investments continue to ramp in the second quarter and into the back half of the year, accompanied by leading growth and strong incrementals. We continue to expect about one point of growth from M&A in 2024, with a negative impact of approximately $30 million US dollars to adjusted operating income for the full year, or a negative impact of about 5 points to reported leverage versus organic leverage. The impact is primarily related to the technology acquisition, Nuvolo, which carries non-cash accelerated intangible amortization of approximately $25 million US dollars, plus year-one acquisition and integration-related costs. We also expect a negative impact to revenues of about 1 percentage point from FX in 2024. FX is expected to offset the point of M&A revenue growth on a reported basis, meaning our organic and reported revenue growth guidance is now the same at 8% to 9% for 2024.\nThere's no change to our organic leverage target of 25%+ for the year, consistent with our stated long-term target. Turning to cash, we had a strong start to free cash flow generation in the first quarter, and we expect 2024 to be another year of free cash flow conversion of 100% or greater. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 8.5% and adjusted EPS of approximately $3.05 US dollars. Please see page 17 for additional information that may be helpful for modeling purposes. Please go to slide number 10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve.\nThird, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 11, and I'll provide an update on our 2024 capital deployment. Year-to-date through April, we've deployed $540 million US dollars in cash, with $190 million US dollars to dividends, and $350 million US dollars to share repurchases. We have $2.1 billion US dollars remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, providing us with strong optionality as our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active. We continue to see potential opportunities for value-accretive M&A, as we did in 2023, where we made key strategic investments to accelerate our progress across energy services and digital solutions, industrial process cooling, and precision temperature control technology.\nFor 2024, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion US dollars in cash. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 13. As discussed, our transport performance in Q1 was as expected, and there's no change to our outlook for the year. The overall markets are expected to be down modestly, and we expect to outperform in both regions. We've continued to provide this slide in the deck for your reference. Please turn to slide number 14. We operate our transport business for the long term, and while we're moving through a modest downturn in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future.\nACT projects a strong trailer market rebound from 2024 into 2025, up 19%, and projects continued growth through their forecast horizon in 2029. We have a diversified transport business globally, with opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system, and a world-class dealer network, we're well-positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to slide number 15. In summary, we are well-positioned to drive differentiated growth and value over time. Our leading innovation, proven business operating system, and unmatched culture enable us to consistently deliver top quartile financial performance over the long term, while continuing to reinvest in our business. I believe our best days are ahead. We have the team, the strategy, and the track record to deliver leading performance in 2024 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. In the interest of time, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you. Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nDave, can you give us a little more color into your order momentum and backlog growth? You obviously enjoyed significant acceleration orders, and you mentioned the strength in applied. Can you give us any more color to how much of the continued Americas orders acceleration is coming from data centers? Do you think you can continue to grow your backlog from here? Maybe your thoughts on the duration of this order cycle if it is, in fact, data center-led?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Andy. Good question. Look, in the quarter, we saw broad-based growth, and it wasn't concentrated necessarily in any one vertical. I mean, we certainly had strength in data centers, education, healthcare, and high-tech industrials. It was almost hard for us to find a vertical that we didn't grow in. We did have a bit of weakness in, I guess you would say, conventional office and some in lodging. For the most part, it was broad-based growth, and it was really on a global level. A lot of strength in our commercial HVAC businesses. The good news is our pipeline is also very strong. This would be before an order actually comes in to be a booking. This is what our sales teams are working on. That continues to be very strong as well.\nLook, it's a lot of innovation. I'm certainly proud of what the team's been able to deliver, and we're executing at a very high level right now.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nDave, we definitely can appreciate that. On that note, organic incremental margins continue to trend higher than your 25%. Given the strength in your markets and the overall ability to execute, why isn't 30% or 35%, as you've been able to record for a while now, the new 25% for Trane? Where are you on, let's say, the slope of productivity projects that you've been undertaking? We know that you've been really focused on productivity after not being able to do as much during the pandemic.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. It's Chris. I'll start, then Dave may jump in. As we think about the first quarter, investments back into the business began to ramp really stronger into February and March than, say, the start of the quarter. Our run rate exiting Q1 is stronger than when we started. The pipeline for investments continues to grow, and these are across multiple categories. To your question, we really like the long-term framework of the 25% or better incrementals. That's what we're continuing to guide for 2024. The investment pipeline and where we can see the market outgrowth here and the order rates and the revenue rates, I think just tells us we want to keep investing back in the business. Think of these investments, again, around innovation, sales, and service investments that Dave talked about in the comments.\nThese are upfront tools as well as people investments, making sure we've got capacity investments, automation in the factory, digital. The list goes on, and we want to make sure we're always funding back into the business. On the productivity side, we're not there yet. We're getting better on the gross productivity, but there's still more opportunities for us going forward.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that, Chris. Great quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Dave, Chris, and Zach, good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, guys. Just following up on Andy's question a little bit, can you mark the market where you're at on data center capability? I know you made that investment in LiquidStack, I think it's called. Do you have kind of—are you developing kind of soup-to-nuts capabilities in the data center to be able to handle some of these newer, hotter chips?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Great question, Scott. I think we've been very well-positioned in the data center vertical for a long time. I think you know this, but technology tends to move pretty fast in this vertical compared to others. We're certainly aware of these new technologies that are being developed really at the terminal side of cooling. Think of that as direct cooling to the chip, or think of it as immersion cooling at the rack level. One of the things that we do really, really well at Trane Technologies is we think about systems. If you think about a data center's cooling systems, you need to think about the entire system. Some of it certainly is what we would call the terminal side, and that's what we just referred to. These systems also require sophisticated air handling, and they also require high-efficiency chillers.\nWe look at the entire system to really help the customer think through the entire energy needs for that, for the whole data center. The other thing that's really emerging, and you're going to hear more about this, is we think of the data center as a thermal management system. I know you know this, but when you're cooling a space, you're removing heat from it. Data centers have a lot of heat. What do you do with that heat that you're removing? Conventional thinking would be it gets emitted back out into the atmosphere. How can you repurpose that heat? We've done some projects, still early stages here, where we're creating district heating loops from the heat that would normally just be wasted and reusing it as an asset. It's a very dynamic space. It's obviously growing at a nice clip.\nIt will grow at a nice rate for the continued future. We're spot in the middle of it, and it's always been a very strong vertical, and it will be in the future.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nThat makes sense, Dave. Just a little bit of a pie in the sky here, but does it make more sense to think about you guys in a data center partnering with somebody like Vertiv or explicitly competing against them? It seems like you both have very different capabilities, but obviously overlap on some critical apps there. How do you guys think about that opportunity when you think about these giant, giant—think about like a one-gigawatt data center or something where the engineering capabilities would presumably almost rely on maybe more than one supplier, not just one? Is that accurate, Dave, or am I thinking about it wrong?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I wouldn't call out any particular company here, but I would tell you that we have technology partners that we work with because you're spot on. It's a cooling system, right? It's no different than, think about a system that exists within a building, right? We may not have every component, but we would have a partner that would have that component. We would help integrate it into a system that would be operating in an efficient way for the customer.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nVery fair. Thank you. Best of luck, guys. Congrats on the start of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian. How you doing?\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nHey. Good. Thank you. Maybe just the first question on the organic sales guide for the year. It looks like the first half you're up maybe about 11% based on the guidance. The full year, you've got up sort of high singles. Second half is there at maybe 6% or so. Is the way to think about that and understand we haven't yet seen cooling season and so forth, but is the way to think about that revenue guide framework? It's a big slowdown in commercial HVAC versus Q1 because of the extremely tough comps. I would have thought Resi and TK would look better year-on-year sales in the back half versus the first half. With the total enterprise sort of going from 11% to 6%, is it just really that commercial HVAC piece just battling the tough comps?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian. It's Chris. I'll start. It is tough comps for commercial HVAC, especially the Americas. They're going to have a great year on a full-year basis. When you think about go back a year in the first quarter of 2023, the growth there in commercial HVAC Americas was around mid-teens. By the fourth quarter of last year, the growth was mid-20s. Think of that as a 10-point increase in terms of growth and revenue throughout last year. The comps do get tougher as we work through 2024. Again, they're going to have an outstanding year this year. You're right. It is a bit of the tough comps in commercial HVAC. Transport Americas, we do expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. That is also due to tough comps.\nThe business was up 20% the first half of 2023, down 20% in the second half of 2023. The comps get easier as we go throughout the year. You're right. You've dialed it in a little bit there. Look, we feel comfortable with the guide that we've put out there now, and our ability to meet or exceed that guide on the full year. Let us get through another quarter of results here in the second quarter. As you know, the first quarter within Trane Technologies is generally our smallest quarter of the year. Let us get through the second quarter. We'll get a better insight on the second half of the year that time. We feel very confident with the guide that we just released today.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nThank you, Chris. Maybe just my follow-up would be on the sort of price and price mix outlook. I think in the first quarter, maybe price was about a 2% tailwind to revenue. Maybe remind us kind of what you're embedding for the year as a whole. Has there been any shift in the expectations on the sort of price mix tailwind in light commercial and Resi HVAC from the refrigerant change and the sort of various EPA movements on that?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Julian. In the first quarter, at an enterprise level, we delivered about 3 points of price. Those comps get tougher as we move throughout the year as we start getting to a little bit more of a normalization of price. Think of the full year now. We're guiding to about 2 points of price. It was certainly a question on the call that we had a few months ago on our full-year guide on price. We thought we could maybe do a little bit better there. Delivering on Q1 gives us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue by 2 points. Think of that as a point of price and a point of volume. In the Americas, we led with price. In the Americas, that's generally been the model within the company. Within that, commercial HVAC would have been stronger.\nAs we think about price mix and maybe inflation a bit, we're very confident in terms of delivering the 20 or 30 basis points, maybe better, in terms of price cost, price versus inflation on the full year. That's one of the best parts of, I think, about our business operating system, has been our ability to remain nimble with pricing, making sure that we've got the right inputs. As we think about commodities and how they kind of play out over the next year to two years, remaining nimble in terms of pricing is something that we've been our business operating. Your comment on residential, Dave, do you want to cover that?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We do not have a lot of 454B, at least in the Americas, built into our guide. Okay. We are obviously ready from a product standpoint, and we will be launching those products as we go through the year. We are not anticipating a large volume in 2024. We will see how the year progresses for 2025. One of the things too on 454B is I saw a couple of pre-comments come out about being a new refrigerant. I just want to make sure everyone's clear. We have been using 454B in Europe for over two years now. This is not a new refrigerant for Trane Technologies. We are very comfortable with the refrigerant, and we have had it in our portfolio for some time. A lot of it baked into the Americas in our time.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Julian.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Great results.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\nGood morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nI wanted to ask if you could opine again on what you think happens with average Resi pricing next year given the 454 transition. You still think it's up kind of 10% to 15%? Or just how would you characterize?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. That's a good question, Gotham. I hope all is well with you. Look, we don't anticipate a lot of 454B product in 2024, as I just said. That will obviously ramp up in 2025. We're not projecting 2025 yet. From a pricing standpoint, we'll announce pricing when we release the products. I think what you've heard from others is probably in the ballpark as to what to expect from a pricing standpoint. We're going to see how the year plays out, okay? We don't see a big pre-buy happening at the end of the year for 410. Maybe you'll get maybe a minor one with some high runners. It's really going to be—nobody wants to get stuck with inventory. We have to watch out to see how the balance plays out, and we'll give you an update as we move through the year.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem, Gotham.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Yeah, stellar results.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe just taking it back to the data center discussion for a second. Is there a way to maybe parse out or range or, on a relative basis, kind of give us any sense for your dollar content on a data center and what the opportunity is?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, you start talking about averages, which are always dangerous, Joe. I mean, I've read reports where people have estimated the 3% to 5% range. In some cases, I'd say they're in the ballpark, and then you get into some hyperscale that may have a different configuration. It's not that far off. Look, we're very strong in this vertical. We have been for a while, and it's going to have a lot of growth in the future, which is exciting. Understand, it's one vertical of many verticals that we play in. In the first quarter, we had broad-based strength. It wasn't just focused on data centers.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's helpful, Dave. Maybe that follow-on question to the other things that are strong, right? You had an electrical peer throw out a $1.2 trillion US dollars mega project number today. It seems like there's just a lot of investment on the come. At the same time, you do have some other funding, like ESSER funding as an example, that might be coming down. Just maybe high level, talk to us about what you see in terms of your quoting activity or what you see coming through the pipe over the next couple of years.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start with mega projects. I mean, I think that mega projects are happening in verticals that we've always been very strong in. It's always difficult to say what's additive versus what's ongoing strength in a particular vertical. That said, our team is tracking over 300 mega projects, and we've had some orders that have been received. However, the majority are still in the pipeline as these are typically longer duration projects to close. A lot of these projects that are deemed as mega projects are global in nature, which gives us really a competitive advantage with our direct sales force because we're able to triage decision-makers and provide technical support in different parts of the world. Well in tune to what's happening with mega projects.\nAs far as ESSER goes, look, ESSER funding, the way it's designed right now, you can take an order up until September of this year, and it has to be fulfilled within the first quarter of 2026. We've done very well with ESSER funding, but we don't believe that the whole education vertical stops after ESSER funding. There's also IRA funding that's available, and, of course, the municipal bond process that's always been very robust in the past. The education vertical has always been strong for Trane Technologies, expected to be strong in the future as well.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSuper. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right, thanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey. Morning, Steve.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSome very nice orders. Congrats.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCan you just talk about what you're seeing on applied versus light commercial, just orders and revenues?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, obviously, in the Americas, which I think is where your question's focused, we were very strong in equipment overall. I mean, our order rate for equipment was up over 40%, and we saw strength really in both applied and unitary. In the past, I've said applied's been a lot stronger. This time, they were pretty close. There's a lot of strength out there, and that makes sense because if you look, we had broad-based growth across really almost all verticals. A lot of those verticals are served with different applications, so it was very strong.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nI guess, are there particular verticals in light commercial that you think you're gaining share in because your main peer had orders down pretty dramatically there?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I can't speak to a competitor because you get comps from one year to another. I would just tell you that at broad-based, you're going to have some verticals that are more on the applied side, but some verticals are more on the unitary side. Think about education. It's probably a 50/50 split. Conventional office typically tends to be more on the unitary side. Not always, but tends to be. Retail will be on the rooftop side. Look, we're very happy with the performance we had in Q1. I don't remember a quarter when I was talking about 40% order growth, and it was as broad-based as we saw in Q1.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. Just one last one. On Resi, can you just break down in that business for the quarter, just the price mix and volume for the quarter?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Revenues were up low single digits. Think of them as very low numbers contributing price, volume in terms of residential. We started getting a lot of small numbers there on up low single digits. It did better than we expected, as Dave talked to earlier. Think of prices really de minimis. Maybe volume was up around one for Resi. Let's see. We're just starting the cooling season here. Let's get through another quarter, and we'll see how the year plays out for residential.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for the call.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Yeah, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey. Doing real well. Thank you. Those were pretty positive comments coming out of China. Can you kind of give us a sense of where the demand is, the outlook, because we have heard some mixed signals about, at best, stabilizing, but it sounds like you're seeing some pretty strong growth.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. The team there continues to execute at a very high level. Very seasoned team. Been in place for they have a lot of tenure with the company. A lot of strength in pharmaceutical, healthcare, high-tech, data centers, which is really where our portfolio plays well with our applied systems. Very happy with what we saw. Now, China is a small percentage of the enterprise in the 5% range, but a lot of strength there, which is encouraging.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's real helpful. Can you give us a sense of where you stand on your services mix, refresh us on the target, and how do you think that plays out for this year?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, it's a great question. I was telling Chris, I think we're going to have in the Americas, we always said our service business was 50% service and 50% equipment. With our equipment growth, we got to go back and look at the calculation. Look, we had a very strong services business in Q1. At a global level, it was up in the low teens. In the Americas, it was up over 15%. There's a compounding effect that's going on there. This is the sixth year where we've had service growth of low single digits. We've invested heavily in this. I think it's one of the areas that sometimes gets underappreciated in Trane Technologies, but I'd tell you it's 1/3 of our business. It's very resilient, and it is an enabler.\nThat team continues to execute at a very high level and expect it in the future as well.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Deane, the six years up high single digits growth in services. Last year was up double digits, and Dave keeps pressuring us to kind of move to the double digits. I'll tell you, the resiliency is he called out, and we like the margins there. Nice start to the year in the business.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dean.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks very much for the question. Good morning. I don't often say this, but great quarter. Fantastic results.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI guess I'm sorry. I've been going back and forth with the different calls here, maybe just step back. I mean, what surprised you to the upside this quarter? I mean, obviously, organic came in a lot better, really strong commercial HVAC trends. Specifically, what really surprised you during this quarter? Was it just backup conversion? Any color there would be helpful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I think there were really two things that were to the upside. One was our commercial HVAC business in the Americas. It really performed better than expectations. Just a lot of demand for our innovative products, and the team executed extremely well. The other upside was in our residential business. Look, we thought that was a business that was going to be down low single digits, maybe even mid-single digits in the beginning of the year for Q1 with destocking that was going to occur. I think that where we kind of got help there was the EPA coming out with their clarification on the sell-through for R-410A and gave confidence to our independent wholesale distributors that they should be stocking up and getting ready for the season, which is what we saw. Those would be the two big areas that kind of where we saw the upside.\nThe rest of the world really played out the way we thought. Europe strengthened, our commercial HVAC business continues. Our Thermo King business, look, it's going to be a modest downturn in Thermo King in the year. We'll do better than the markets, but that's exactly what we saw play out in the first quarter. Asia, pretty much as we thought, maybe a little bit stronger in our commercial HVAC business, but it really played out as expected in the rest of the world.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nMy follow-on is just the standard here, just the resilience of the commercial HVAC orders and backlog, especially in the backdrop of such weak DOT starts, ABI, etc. I'm just wondering, obviously, there's pockets of strength in data centers, etc., but is there increasing evidence of just more proactive replacement demands, CO2 emission targets really driving demands? Any color there?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I can't answer that specifically. I haven't looked that way, but I would tell you that we continue to see a very strong pipeline. This would be what our sales force is actually out working on, that they're putting in our CRM systems, and that remains very robust. There's a lot of activity out there. I hear the disconnect too when you look at API or some of the other macro numbers. You just have to look at, we don't look at just one, okay? You have to look at several. Some are aligned to one vertical versus another vertical. Look, we saw very strong demand, broad-based, and the pipelines are still strong.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI can. How are you?\nHey, good morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. How are you? How are you? Good morning.\nJust a question. As we think about cooling for semiconductor plants and data centers, right, it seems that the scale of the projects is going up. The question I have for that: A, does this provide an opportunity to provide more sophisticated solution to your customers, and also to capture more value to Trane? Second, what are you doing to your aftermarket support organization to take advantage of that?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We talked a little bit about data centers earlier, but look, this is a vertical that tends to move faster from a technology adoption than others. We're working closely with partners and data center customers to understand what the trends are. I would tell you, we're right in the middle of it. In a data center, Andrew, look at the entire system, okay? We like to look at things at a system level. You're hearing a lot right now on the terminal side of data centers. That would be like direct cooling to the chip or immersion cooling. We look at the entire system, the air handling side of it as well as the sophisticated chillers, the high-efficiency chillers with next-gen refrigerants that are also required.\nI think where you're going to hear a little bit more is on the thermal management side of a data center. They produce a lot of heat. That heat is taken out of the data center. How can you repurpose it? That's some of the technology that we're in discussions, kind of at a thought leadership level, as to how we can take an asset and heat or heat and turn it into an asset in the future.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, my question, I think, was more basic. I was just thinking that these systems are bigger and more complex. They're more energy-hungry, more opportunity for your, more need for your customers to partner up with you, and more opportunity for you to sort of provide these package energy-saving solutions. That's where I was going.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're right on, Andy. All opportunities. It's a growing vertical.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGotcha. Just follow-up on M&A. You guys have been pretty active over the past couple of years. Looking at the market, the market is on to the fact that, once again, manufacturing clean rooms by a pharma, all the areas you guys have been focusing on. These are, I think, are getting hot, pardon my pun. What's the environment looking like for these bolt-ons? What's your ability to sort of pursue targets that are reasonable valuations? What does the pipeline look right now? What are you interested in? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndrew, I'll start. It's Chris. Yeah. Pipeline remains very active. It's sometimes episodic when an M&A transaction closes. Quarter by quarter, maybe hard to call, but over the course of a year, I think the pipeline remains very active.\nWe're very happy with the acquisitions we've done over, say, the last 18, 24 months, right? You properly described them as a bolt-on bit of strategy. Think of that around investments in the channel, and investments in technology. In some cases, it's both. It's taking a great technology that has a limited channel and applying it to our deep channels in Europe and/or in the Americas. We've been very successful with that strategy. As it looks at the pipeline today, we're going to remain disciplined. We've got our hurdle rates, and as we think about what's constructive to be EPS accretive in three years, ROIC accretive in three years.\nI'll tell you that we've got a great balance sheet to really deploy to not only acquisitions, but also deploy if the cash isn't available for M&A over to share repurchases as we see the stock trading below our calculated intrinsic value. If you go back even six, seven years ago with an acquisition in Europe with Thermo Cold, and you really started out with our four-pipe chillers and thermal management systems and how that's grown over time now, I think to our sixth or seventh generation of thermal management systems, it tells you that we can take that early-stage technology and really grow it over a longer period of time. We've got the people, we have a great sales team, we have a great service team.\nThat's where some of those investments are going as well this year, to make sure we have all the infrastructure and support to keep growing those businesses. I'll tell you, we've got a great team in each of our regions that can integrate acquisitions. When you think about the challenge of an acquisition, a lot of times the success is dependent on how well you integrate. We don't think of it as Trane Technologies is acquiring and let's take our best of Trane to the business. It really is also, what are we learning from the business we just acquired and bringing it into our organization? I'll tell you, some of our recent acquisitions, it's spot on with taking the learnings of the businesses we've acquired, bringing them into the Trane family, and how do we replicate that across 40, 50 plants across the globe?\nI'll tell you where we're bullish in this area. I just say the pipeline remains strong.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat answer. Really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer",
    "content2": "Thanks. Dave, this is going to be a broad question, but it goes to what you discussed around the increasing complexity in applied. When we think about the customer value proposition, and I understand there are many dimensions that's going to differ across verticals, how does the increasing complexity play into the customer value proposition? Maybe give us the two or three biggest dimensions that that really speaks to, and where that creates a sustainable competitive differentiation for the company.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Great question, Noah. I think it all starts with our direct sales force that's highly technical, right? They understand the applications. A lot of times, helping the customer think through what the best solution is for whatever their need may be. I always tell people, we don't sell products, we sell solutions, and that's the way our account managers behave with customers. As the sophistication of these products continues to increase, obviously, our strength shines really on a global basis. A lot of the decision-makers, especially some of these mega projects right now, are on a global basis. Because we have this direct sales force globally, we're able to really triage the decision-makers and help them think through the technical side. Of course, the downstream effect is these products are more sophisticated, and they require OEM service in the future.\nThere's a long tail associated with these applied systems that we're selling. We're investing heavily too. It's not like people sometimes think about, as I say, we're investing in capacity. They think of it as just the plant. Okay, that's part of our capacity investment. We're also investing heavily in training of our direct sales force, adding to our direct sales force, adding to our service technicians, adding to our engineer skill set, adding to our critical-to-close process, adding to our back offices to make sure we have the right customer support. It's all inclusive, but the sophistication of these systems as they become more and more engineered really just plays into the strength we have as Trane Technologies.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, David. The follow-up is really around the attach rate of services to those projects, right? I think you've answered it in part, but just quantitatively, how do we think about services attach rates for applied at this point, and where those grow to as you see the increasing complexity of the projects you're working on?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAs I said in my opening remarks, we think about an applied system. You can think about an 8 to 10x multiplier of services over the life of that system. We want to be connected to the system, okay? It is no longer just a break fix. This is all connected solutions. By the way, the customer wants us connected to the solution. They want to make sure that their asset is always performing the way it was designed. I was telling a group earlier this week that it is no longer the system is not operating properly. The system is using too much energy. Well, we will be able to detect that. That is where the sophistication goes both ways. It is on the application of the system, but then how you monitor and service that system is also increasing in complexity. We are right in the leading edge there.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAppreciate that. Thanks, Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Noah.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Zach Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. We'll be around, as always, for any questions that you may have in the coming days and weeks. We look forward to seeing many of you on the road, or actually at our headquarters in some cases, in the near future here. Thanks again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks again and have a great day."

Welcome to the Trane Technologies Q4 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Julianne, and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies Q4 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.\nThis presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and everyone for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our differentiated financial results over time. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. These trends continue to intensify and increase the demand for our sustainable solutions. The year 2023 was recently confirmed as the warmest on record and caused many extreme weather events around the world. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change on people's lives.\nThat's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. We are the partner of choice to help our customers advance their own sustainability goals while driving broad impact through our Gigaton Challenge, a pledge to reduce customers' emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation, and proven business operating system enable us to consistently deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins, and powerful Free Cash Flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet.\nPlease turn to slide number four. We expect to deliver top quartile financial performance over the long term, consistently and reliably on behalf of our shareholders. This is core to our culture, and central to how we set our targets and execute our strategy across our global portfolio. I'm proud of how our global teams rose to the challenge in 2023 and met or exceeded our targets top to bottom. We track top quartile performance against our core peer group closely.\nWhile the results are not yet in, we believe we'll hit top quartile on Organic Revenue growth, up 9%, and Adjusted EPS growth, up 23%. We also delivered Free Cash Flow of $2.2 billion, or 103% Free Cash Flow conversion, enabling us to make key strategic M&A investments, while raising our dividend and returning significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Please turn to slide number five. Relentless investment in innovation and growth, people and culture, and our business operating system are hallmarks of Trane Technologies. Over time, we see clear benefits accruing, as evidenced by our strong track record.\nSince 2020, we have delivered a revenue compound annual growth rate of 12%, 260 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion, and Free Cash Flow conversion of approximately 100%, enabling us to execute a balanced capital deployment strategy. We believe we're well positioned to continue to drive strong performance for shareholders over the long term. Please turn to slide number six. Q4 was another strong quarter. Despite challenges in our transport and residential businesses, we leveraged the strength of our diversified, resilient global portfolio, and our best-in-class business operating system to deliver strong financial performance as an enterprise.\nIn the Americas, we expected the residential markets to continue to normalize and for the transport refrigeration markets to move into a moderate down cycle in Q4. While the markets were down more than anticipated, each business delivered strong bookings growth in the quarter, strengthening our position entering 2024. Global commercial HVAC markets continue to be robust, and we're leveraging the power of our direct sales force to identify and pivot to the highest growth opportunities.\nWe're thriving in key verticals such as data centers and high-tech industrial, working alongside these highly sophisticated customers to solve their most pressing challenges with ultra-efficient, bespoke solutions. This is one of the things that Trane Technologies does best, and our commercial HVAC bookings, backlog, and revenue reflect our success. To put this in context, our Americas commercial HVAC bookings are up more than 50% on a three-year stack. Our applied bookings, where we estimate an 8 to 10x multiplier of higher margin services for every dollar of equipment sold, are up over 100% on a three-year stack.\nAs we look at our commercial HVAC and markets over the next several years, we see a strong pipeline of projects increasingly playing to our unique strengths. We entered 2024 with a backlog of $6.9 billion, with the composition shifting increasingly towards commercial HVAC, including a large percentage of long-cycle applied systems. For 2023, backlog in commercial HVAC is up approximately $700 million. Over the past three years, our commercial HVAC backlog has nearly tripled.\nTurning to guidance, we expect another year of strong financial performance with Organic Revenue growth of 6% to 7% and Adjusted EPS of $10 to 10.30. Chris will discuss some of the key dynamics later in the presentation. Please go to slide number seven. Demand for our innovative products and services continues to be broad-based across our segments. During the fourth quarter, organic bookings were up 12%, led by our commercial HVAC businesses. In the Americas segment, commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-teens, and revenues were even stronger, up mid-20s. Revenues were up more than 30% in equipment, with particular strength in applied.\nServices growth was also outstanding, up mid-teens, as our service business continues to compound at a rapid rate. Our residential business continues to normalize as expected, the market declined at a faster rate than anticipated entering the quarter. We expect the normalization process to continue in the near term, to return to a GDP-plus growth over the medium to long term. Bookings were healthy, up 8%. Our transport business was the tale of two halves. The first half of the year, revenues were up about 20%, and the back half of the year, down 20%. Q4 marked the beginning of a modest market down cycle, which is expected to snap back in 2025.\nOur fourth quarter was down approximately 20% against a tough prior year growth comp of up 30%. For full year 2023, we modestly outperformed end markets, which were down 5%. Our AMEA segment delivered strong performance in the quarter. Commercial HVAC bookings were robust, up mid-teens. Revenues were up high single digits in Q4, and up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Transport bookings were flat as expected, and revenues were up mid-single digits for Q4. In 2023, revenues were up low single digits, outperforming end markets, which were down mid-single digits. Our Asia-Pacific segment performed in line with our expectations.\nRevenues were flat in commercial HVAC due to a tough prior year comp, which was up low 20s. China bookings were down low single digits, but up high single digits on a two-year stack. Revenues were down mid-single digits against an up low teens prior year comp. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number eight. The scoreboard for the quarter highlights strong execution, top to bottom. Organic Revenues were up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up 150 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively, and Adjusted EPS was up 19%. Q4 Adjusted EPS includes a $0.03 headwind related to foreign exchange losses from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low single digits and low teens, respectively.\nServices growth continues to be a standout, representing about 1/3 of our enterprise revenues and making Trane Technologies more resilient, with higher recurring revenues at higher margins over time. Over the past six years, our services business delivered a compound annual growth rate of high single digits. 2023 services growth was even higher, up double digits. Last but not least, I want to thank our global teams for once again delivering strong Free Cash Flow throughout the year, resulting in 103% Free Cash Flow conversion. Please turn to slide number nine.\nAt the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization, and productivity that more than offset inflation. In the Americas segment, we delivered about four points of volume, three points of price, and 200 basis points of margin expansion. While volume growth was modestly higher than price growth at the segment level, it's important to understand the dynamics below the segment level. Robust volume growth of approximately 20 points in commercial HVAC, accompanied by strong leverage, more than offset volume declines in residential and transport.\nThe AMEA segment delivered strong incrementals and margin expansion, with organic revenues up high single digits in the quarter, made up of approximately five points of volume, and three points of price. The segment also delivered approximately six points of M&A growth in the quarter. Organic incrementals were greater than 30%. The Asia segment delivered strong margin expansion and organic leverage on flattish revenues, with positive price and productivity in the quarter adding to margin expansion. As we've highlighted throughout the year, we reinvested heavily in our business and accelerated the timing of key projects across the enterprise in 2023.\nWe see a tight linkage between investments and innovation, and market outgrowth, and we will continue to leverage opportunities to go further and faster. A few high-priority areas in 2023 and 2024 are sales and services excellence, digital, and factory automation. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 10. Looking at our segments and markets, we're excited about the year ahead. We expect continued strength in our commercial HVAC businesses globally, which comprise about 65% of our revenues, supported by robust end markets, unprecedented backlog, our innovative portfolio, and our world-class sales and services teams. We expect the strength of this business to more than offset softness we may see in other parts of the portfolio. We expect the residential markets, which comprise about 20% of our revenues, to continue to normalize in the near term, but to show significant improvement in 2024 versus 2023.\nWe expect modest declines in our transport markets globally in 2024, which comprise about 15% of our revenues, with a snapback to growth in 2025. Further, we see opportunities to outperform and further mitigate the market impact and to deleverage within gross margin rates. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 11. Our guidance for 2024 reflects our optimism in key end markets and our ability to outperform. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in continued investment in innovation, outgrowth across our end markets, healthy leverage, and strong Free Cash Flow. We're guiding 2024 to 6% to 7% Organic Revenue growth and $10 to 10.30 in Adjusted Earnings Per Share, or approximately 11% to 14% EPS growth. We've included approximately one point of growth from M&A in 2024, reflecting the carryover impact from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2023.\nWe're targeting organic leverage of 25%+ for the year, which is consistent with our stated long-term target. While we expect our recent M&A transactions to have a strong payout over the next several years, we're expecting a modest headwind to operating income and to leverage in 2024 from M&A. Overall, we expect a negative impact of $30 million to operating income for the full year, primarily related to our technology acquisition, Nuvolo, which carries non-cash accelerated intangibles amortization of approximately $25 million, plus year-one acquisition and integration-related costs.\nWe expect this acquisition to be EPS accretive by year three, consistent with our M&A framework. Turning to cash, we expect 2024 to be another year of Free Cash Flow conversion of 100% or greater. We also wanted to provide some color on how we see the first quarter. We expect Organic Revenue growth of approximately 7%, led by continued strong commercial HVAC growth, partially offset by softer residential and transport markets. We expect Adjusted EPS between $1.60 and $1.65, reflecting high levels of incremental business reinvestment we've discussed for 2024, and consistent with our historical Q1 adjusted earnings as a percentage of our full-year earnings between 15% and 16%.\nPlease go to slide number 12. During 2023, we delivered an incremental $60 million of transformation savings. Over the last four years, we have successfully delivered $300 million of run rate savings from our business transformation program. The additional savings have allowed us to reinvest in our high-performance flywheel, which ultimately drives consistent top quartile EPS growth. While this discreet program is complete, as a lean-based company with a world-class business operating system, self-help cost reduction programs through productivity are part of our DNA. This has been a strong lever for incremental margins historically and will continue to be in the future.\nPlease go to slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nOur balanced approach includes strategic M&A, which further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 14, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. During 2023, and including activity in January 2024, we deployed $2.4 billion in cash, including approximately $750 million to share repurchases, $684 million to dividends, and approximately $900 million on strategic M&A. We are targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2024 and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nWe have significant dry powder, with approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our strong Free Cash Flow, Liquidity, and Balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and in 2023, we made key strategic investments to accelerate our progress across energy services and digital solutions, industrial process cooling, and precision temperature control technology. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 16. In 2023, we delivered solid execution across our transport businesses globally and outperformed our end markets. Over the past three years, we've outgrown our end markets by roughly 30 percentage points. Globally, in 2024, we're expecting a relatively shallow down cycle and an Americas transport weighted average forecast of down 10% and an EMEA forecast of down low single digits. In the table on the page, we've also included forecasts for the big three: trailer, truck, and APU, for your reference. We expect to outperform the markets in both segments in 2024 and to delever within gross margin rates.\nThis slide also includes some additional data points related to our transport businesses that you may find helpful. Please turn to slide number 17. We operate our transport businesses for the long term, and while we're moving through a modest downturn in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a strong trailer market rebound from 2024 to 2025, up 19%, and projects continued growth through their forecast horizon in 2028. We have a diversified transport business globally, with opportunities to grow across the portfolio.\nWith leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system, and a world-class dealer network, we're well-positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to slide number 18. In summary, we are well-positioned to drive significant value over time. We are proud to have been recently named to Corporate Knights 2024 Global 100 List. Our uplifting culture, and our talented team around the world, help us fulfill our purpose every day.\nThis focus on purpose, along with the strength of our business operating system and continued high levels of customer demand, enabled us to consistently deliver strong financial performance while continuing to reinvest in our business. We believe we have the strategy, the innovation, and the team to deliver strong performance in 2024 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Please kindly limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Dave and Chris and Zach.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. Good morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI feel like a broken record, but good quarter, year, etc. You took, looks like, $60 million or something of cost out structurally. Is that, just to clarify, is that to kind of reset the cost base into this downturn in transport and perhaps resi, or is that more kind of structurally spread out?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott, it's Chris. The $60 million is, let's say, the final year of that $300 million cost takeout program that we launched at the start of Trane Technologies. $300 million run rate savings now achieved by the end of 2023. We really just wanted to put a little bit of a bow around that program. However, I would tell you that the business operating system that we've had and we've built over a decade, it's really driven to drive strong productivity and cost savings over the long term.\nWhile that discreet program is behind us, I would say we're very focused on the cost structure of the company and making sure we're getting the right leverage over the long term. We'll always look at opportunities to lean out the structure in the organization.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Guys, you've got a high-class problem in that you're generating a lot of cash. You've delivered. Give us a sense that the M&A kind of possibles. Is there a pipeline? I know you have a competitor that seems like they're going to be selling some assets, but is there an active pipeline that's interesting and material enough to kind of help put capital to work?\nI mean, share buybacks obviously can always be an option, but walk us through kind of how you think about M&A, at least, and whether there is kind of a higher or lower or some sort of a TAM associated with potentials out there that you guys think about.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How you doing? This is Dave. Look, our M&A pipeline is strong, and I think we've been able to demonstrate. I think we actually closed five deals in 2023. We like technologies, we like products that we could put through our channels, and I think you see the success that we've had with those, whether it be MTA last year, AL-KO. We recently acquired Nuvolo, which we're very excited about from, think of it as augmenting our connected solutions. Very excited the more I learn about Nuvolo. Look, we have a very active pipeline.\nWe love the portfolio we have today. I think you've heard me say in the past, we don't need to do anything, but obviously, we're always looking for opportunities where we can take a technology or a channel and expand what we do great today. We'll continue to be active in that area and expect more to come.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nFair enough. Best of luck this year, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood luck. All right. Hey, thanks, Scott. Thank you. Thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the organic growth framework for the year. You have the 6% to 7% guide. When we're thinking sort of by maybe end-market vertical, let's say, rather than your geographic segments, is it fair to assume that that growth rate you're embedding, sort of 9%, 10% in commercial HVAC, maybe flattish in resi, and then down single digits in TK globally? Is that roughly the right framework?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're pretty close there. You're spot on there, Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you. My, I guess, quick follow-up would be on the operating leverage point. Yeah, the Organic Operating Leverage of sort of 25%+, you've got that's your normal run rate, but a step down from what was realized in 2023.\nThe step down, is that just it's early in the year, so no reason to diverge from the long-term framework, or is there anything specific going on in terms of, say, a much smaller price cost, tailwinds, maybe something in mix or accelerating reinvestment spend, anything like that you'd call out when thinking about the organic leverage 2024 versus last year?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Julian. It's Chris. Look, the 25% organic leverage or better, you're right, it's part of our long-term target within the company and our guide for 2024. It gives us a lot of optionality to invest back in our businesses at a steady rate, really drive market outgrowth. I'll tell you, we continue to see lots of opportunities to invest back into our businesses. We do expect 2024 to be a year of increased investments, just like 2023 was. Some of the examples we put out there, I mean, there's the continued innovation investment. Think about the electrification of our portfolios in heating, cooling, and transport products, self-help around factory automation.\nWe're always looking out three to four years in terms of demand and making sure we've got the infrastructure to keep up with that demand. Factory automation is a big investment for us. We continue into 2024. Digital, think about digital services, digital controls. Dave just talked about the Nuvolo acquisition we're very excited about. There's going to be continued investment there, expanding digital twin opportunities. I can keep running down the list, but I'll end with sales and service investments. We really see that over now six years, driving high single-digit CAGR and services growth.\nWe really like making investments in that space as well. It's about 1/3 of our overall enterprise revenues. The fact that we want to get started earlier in the year with those investments means that the payback will come sooner from that earlier start. Those are some of the reasons. The guide is 25%+. We want to make sure we're always relentlessly investing. Frankly, we don't want anyone to catch up to where our investments are today.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's a great question. We really like the model we have today with 25%+. It gives us a lot of optionality. As a CEO, you look at our results, right? You look at the top line, you say, okay, we're going to have 9% growth for the year. I'm not sure that's going to be top quartile. We believe it will be. We'll see when everyone else reports. I look at the bottom line, and I look at EPS growth of 23%. I'm pretty confident that'll be top quartile. By the way, that's the third consecutive year that we've had 20% or greater EPS growth. I look at the quality of our earnings, Julian, and I'll use Free Cash Flow as a proxy to determine that.\nOver a three-year period, Free Cash Flow of 100%. We're very happy with the model. You take that and you wrap it around our culture, which is uplifting and a can-do culture that we have at Trane Technologies. We're very excited about the future, and we're very happy with our performance in the past. I always tell people, our brightest days are still in front of us. Expect more investment, expect more growth, and expect us to continue to innovate for the industry.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. I just had one tiny follow-up on the sales outlook, Dave. Transport down single digits. Any big divergence first half versus second half in terms of the year-on-year there? Right now, it looks pretty sort of steady down through the year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo, I think the first half will be tougher than the second half. Okay. A lot of that has to do with the comps. As I said in our prepared remarks, think of the Americas. The weighted average will be down in the 10%. We'll do better than that. We'll outperform. EMEA's a little bit down, low single digits. We'll do better than that as well. Look, our Thermo King business, it's a great business. In fact, actually, right up to this meeting, I'm going to be joining the Thermo King dealer network in the Americas. It's a great business.\nWe have such a great dealer network there. We've been through these slight downturns before. This will snap back. If you look at what Axe is projecting right now, it's down in 2024, a quick snapback into 2025, and then they have growth through 2028. We're very optimistic with a lot of the innovation that we've already launched and what's coming, that this is a great business, not only today, but well into the future.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask about orders. In the back half of the year, orders have been incredibly strong, and they've really bifurcated when compared to any sort of industry benchmark we look at or peers. Is there anything specific that's driving that pickup in orders that we've seen over the last six months? Anything you would comment on data center because it feels like a lot of the ramp we've seen has kind of lined up with a lot of the investment that we're seeing in data center and AI specifically. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Chris, great question. Our team has just executed at a very high level. I'll start with that. You think about it, with the direct sales force, we're able to really pivot to where the opportunity is. We track it. I'll use the Americas here, but we track 14 different verticals. There are some verticals that are very strong right now. Data centers, you just spoke about. Also in the high tech, think of the semiconductor space. Education's another Healthcare's another very strong verticals.\nWe're able to capture those opportunities with our direct sales force, very technical sales force, and be able to really meet or exceed, in many cases, exceed our customers' expectations. Very happy with what we've seen from an order growth standpoint in the Americas. Very happy as well as in Europe. That team has continued to perform very well. In Asia, I know we've heard a lot on the different calls that have already occurred where people were talking about being down in Asia. Well, our business in Asia, with the leadership team we have there, we're doing very well in Asia.\nOur revenue growth in Asia last year was 10%. By the way, that's on a two-year stack, that's 20%. The team performs very, very well there. I'd be also the service business that we have. I could not be prouder of what our service business, really on a global basis, has been able to do. In 2023, our service business was up in the teens. On a compound annual growth rate over the last six years, our service business has been up in the high single digits. As our installed base continues to increase in the applied space, you could see that tailwind really happening within service.\nVery happy with our results and very happy with the order book that we have going into 2024. It gives us a lot of visibility into 2024.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nI appreciate that. Maybe just following up on data center. I know we're in the very, very early innings on AI. Is there any way that you could frame Trane's positioning in that market, the opportunity that you see going forward? Just because it is very new, but it also does seem very significant. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's not new to us. I mean, we've been in data centers for a long time. We're very strong in that vertical. There's a lot of public information out there that's trying to size the data center market. It's somewhat difficult. You have a lot of variations in those reports just because, by nature, the data center market, it's very confidential to data center providers. They don't want a lot of that information out. If you look at the reports and just kind of triangulate it, you get a global market anywhere between, I mean, it's a big range, but $6.5 billion to up to $10 billion.\nI mean, it's a big range up there. If you look at growth rates, if you take the most conservative growth rate, you're going to see high teens, maybe mid-teens growth on a compound annual growth rate for the next five years. This is a very strong vertical today. We do very, very well in it with our very technical sales team calling on data center customers and working with them. It's very strong today and anticipated being strong well into the future.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gautam. Gautam. Upper row. I think we might want to come back to Gautam.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. I'll move on to Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning and nice end of the year. Dave, look, the service business we've talked about now for several years, it's been great for you guys, and yet continues to accelerate. In 2023, the double-digit growth number is pretty impressive. Just maybe could you maybe just point out what's allowing you to continue to accelerate that business here? Is it something around your digital offering, connected, how much you're connecting, how much feet you're putting on the street? What is it that's kind of driving this acceleration and growth in that service business? How do you see that playing out in the coming years?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Joe. Thanks for the question. I think I'd say yes, yes, and yes. It's a system of things that makes our service business great. It starts with a great operating system around our service business. We track probably 30 different KPIs. If you went to one of our offices, you'd see very detailed tracking on our service, which really leads to our success. It's a great business. Okay? I won't disclose too much about our playbook, but we have a very detailed playbook, and you see it in our results. I would tell you that our service business is really built around our applied systems.\nAs our applied systems continue to populate at an increasing rate, you could see the tail that we're getting in our service business. Think about applied systems. I said this in our opening remarks. Think about it as for every dollar of equipment, think about 8 to 10x over the life of our service business. You could now start to see that flywheel that's being created in our service business. Great business today. As Chris said, it's about 1/3 of the enterprise, growing nicely. We're investing heavily in it because we know there's a lot of opportunities in the future as well.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, that's great to hear. I guess, look, there's a lot of good news in this print. I know that there's some investor concern around the healthiness of the office market in 2024, and ultimately whether that's going to be a drag on growth for a lot of companies. Can you maybe just address that market specifically and how that's impacting your business or expected to in 2024?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I mean, I'll speak of the Americas. I think I said earlier, we track about 14 different verticals. Office is one of the weaker ones in 2023, and right now, we're forecasting that weakness to continue in 2024. We do believe that at one point, office will come back. With our direct sales force, we'll pivot to that opportunity and capture that opportunity. Right now, it's going to be soft, at least through 2024. We'll report back as the year progresses as to how that vertical is behaving.\nThere's a lot in the news about it. It's got some recovery to do, but it'll be soft in 2024. That's all baked into our guide, Joe. We've taken that into account. I would tell you that the strength that we're seeing in some other verticals are going to more than compensate for what we're seeing in the office vertical.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Good morning and congrats on a very strong '23.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Steve. Appreciate it.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nWhat are you guys embedding for price this year in general for the Americas? I mean, you said it was 3% in the quarter, I think. What are you embedding for your 2024 guide?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Steve, it's Chris. Think about 2024 at the enterprise level around a point of price. It could be a little better than that. As we've seen throughout 2023, the price contribution has started to level off as we move through the quarters. We had over six points of price in Q1, and we ended the fourth quarter with less than 3% of price. There'll be some carryover into 2024, but we're dialing in at the enterprise level probably around a point. Could be a little bit better than that.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Your inflation is kind of stable, I would assume?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Tier one is fairly stable. I appreciate the notes you put out every weekend with updates on commodities. It's a close read. At tier two, that happens to be inflationary, right, as we're looking at wage inflation, refrigerants, or a couple of examples in that space. We continue to work with our vendors on the demand we're putting through with our order growth. Tier two is a bit inflationary. Freight could be a little bit inflationary going into 2024, with a very positive, at least for us, in 2023 on the cost side.\nOverall, I would say we're on track to get 20, 30 basis points price over cost in the year, like we would normally target. We remain flexible, right? Where we see things turn and we need to make another price adjustment, we've got the business operating system to do that.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nI would assume, sorry, just on a follow-up on the price, I would assume that the majority of that price is still coming in commercial. When you talk about that flat revenue number for Rezi, is that basically like what's the volume kind of price split that you're assuming in Rezi, I guess, is the question?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. All in for Rezi, we're dialing in a flat year. Our guide would take into account a ± low single digits on full year revenues for Rezi. I'd expect price to be at that one or less kind of level for residential. Really is going to depend on what we think for the volume in the year. Not a lot of price necessarily coming through at this point.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nFor 2025, are you guys going to push through the A2L price like everybody else? The 10%, 10 to 15%?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We do not have a lot baked into 2024 on the conversion to 454B. If we think that does have an impact, it is certainly second half of the year, maybe fourth quarter impact. We have not dialed in the pricing exactly on that. We will do that as we get ready to launch the products. It is in the ballpark of what others have said around pricing. We will see how the year evolves. We will see how the demand plays with the 410A product versus the 454B transition. We will update as we kind of go through the year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nTo be specific, Steve, this is Dave. Yeah. For sure, we will see that in 2025. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you? Good morning. Good.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? Dave, can you give us more color on the traction of your thermal management systems in EMEA and the progress you're making in bringing thermal management systems to the US? Is it possible to quantify the business at this point or at least give us color on how to think about how much of your growth in EMEA is coming from thermal management systems, and where you are in terms of bringing it out here in the US?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's a great question. We continue to do very well in Europe, obviously, as you see in our results. Obviously, some of that has to do with thermal management systems, which is really electrification of heating. Some of it has to do with some key verticals that are very strong, like data centers and electronics. Look, we're migrating that technology to different parts of the world. It's not just in the US. We're also bringing it to Asia. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to electrify heating and to significantly reduce the carbon footprint for buildings and help them decarbonize around the globe.\nWe have already introduced several products in different regions. That trend will continue in 2024. By the way, I don't want you to think that we've stopped innovating in Europe because that continues as well. I think the last time I was there, it was like our fourth or fifth generation of what's happening there. This is an evolving market. We believe it's a tremendous opportunity, excuse me, for the future. We have solutions that have such great paybacks for our customers that I know a lot of people are, I was getting asked the other day about some of the incentives around this.\nI'm like, yeah, the incentives are great tailwinds. These projects stand on their own. I mean, there's great paybacks. If you're able to increase the efficiency by three, four times, these are fantastic opportunities for Trane Technologies, and they're fantastic opportunities for our customers to really help them decarbonize and actually save money as well in the process. We're really excited about thermal management systems and expect to see more around the world.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVery helpful. Dave, I wanted to double-click on your comments around Asia and China in particular. As you said, China bookings barely down, I think, revenue up. As you mentioned, one of your peers had a relatively sharp deterioration in bookings in China. You mentioned the strength of your team there. Maybe talk about the durability of growth that you see there and what you're doing to sustain that growth.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'm so proud of what our team's been able to do in Asia. In fact, Thursday morning, I had my 6:30AM call with the Asia Team. They're super excited about what they see moving forward. I think that sometimes if you look at the headlines coming out of China specific, right, you're going to see GDP down, and you see what's happening in the residential space there. I would tell you that the verticals that we're really strong in continue to be strong. It is the pharmaceutical, it is semiconductor, it is data centers. We have great offerings there, and we continue to win. We're excited about the opportunities that exist in front of us there.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAwesome. Keep up the good work.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Andy. Talk to you soon. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYour line is open. Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey. Morning, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey. Morning. Sorry. I'm just a few minutes late. I got kind of the end market kind of organic outlook within the 6 to 7. How about geographically? Did you address that? How do three regions fit within the 6 to 7 guide?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Jeff. It's Chris. What we really talked about was in the Americas and in EMEA for commercial HVAC, we can really see from our guide probably up by single digits for the year. In the Americas with Rezi, we're guiding that around flat, ± LSD, but we're calling it flat. TK Americas, markets are down around 10 points on a blended average basis. We'll outperform that. Think of that around mid-single digits down in the Americas. If I go to transport and EMEA, markets also down, low single digits, and we'll outperform those markets.\nOne of the slides we really like putting into the materials is really just the history of market performance versus our performance within the transport businesses. It gives us a lot of confidence with the investments we made over the years, and we continue to make, that we've got the ability to outperform markets again in 2024. Think of EMEA as if the market's down low singles, then we're flat to maybe a little bit better than that. Asia, to Dave's point, with a great team there, we're seeing somewhere in the mid-singles kind of range. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context. Julian got pretty close to it when he asked the question before, but I'll just kind of summarize it here.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Just think about a lot of strength around commercial HVAC globally.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah. It sounds, Dave, that commercial HVAC price, I guess, is up a little bit more. Enterprise is up one. Rezi is up one on price. Maybe TK's got less with the volume pressures. I actually would have thought commercial price would be a little bit better than maybe kind of the 1+ implied. Can you just maybe kind of talk to that a little bit, like the price in the backlog versus new things that you're trying to do on price just to kind of react to that tier two inflation you were talking about?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Jeff, it's Chris. I mean, look, it's early in the year. Rezi on the comment, we're calling it flat on a full year basis. We'll see if we get any price growth there, maybe a little bit. Even on our 1% guide for the full year, could it be better than that? Yes. We remain flexible as we move through the year, and we'll look at the dynamics of cost. Right now, we've got a positive spread in the guide like we would target any year. We'll be nimble to opportunities. Think of it as just the start of the year. We like putting out guidance that we can meet or exceed on a full year basis, and we'll update you as we go through.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nRight. Hey, maybe one just quick follow-up. Dave, a lot of your earlier comments on the call kind of about making your own luck, right, with the Salesforce and everything. You may have heard one of your competitors sort of gave up on the IRA yesterday. It'd be nice if something happens, but we don't see it. What's your view on really how some of the stimulus might work its way through the system? Are you actually seeing any tangible benefits?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we're still holding out hope, okay? Look, we are seeing some of it in the commercial space with the 179D tax credit. That is driving some tailwinds, okay? On the Rezi side, yes, that's been a little bit muted. We're still hopeful that could work through. We're still marketing to the customers about heat pumps, the importance of heat pumps, and how we could help them. The key is going to be on IRA. I've said this in the past, Jeff, you got to make it simple, right?\nMake it simple. It's complex. Don't let that complexity make its way to the customer because they won't understand it. We've been really good with taking the complexity out of some of these more intricate policies, and that's going to be the key to success. The short answer is we still believe it's a tailwind. It's going to be a tailwind for both residential and for commercial. We just hope that the pipe starts opening in residential sooner versus later.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you for that color. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Jeff. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dean Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Dean. How are you? Good morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI'm doing real well. Thank you. What has surprised you about the Rezi inventory normalization process and how long you think it might extend into 2024?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, what maybe surprised me a little bit is the amount of time it's taken to burn off. I think you heard me in our third quarter call was we thought we'd be complete in Q4, and that's not the case. This will burn off eventually. Right now, it's going to go in through at least the first quarter, really the first half. Look, we're optimistic on residential. It's a great business. It will snap back. I've always said for a long time now, think of Rezi as a GDP-plus business. That hasn't changed. The inventory and the independent wholesale distributor channel will start to align to demand. It's the first quarter. I remind you of that.\nWe'll see what happens here as we get into peak season. We'll give you an update as we get to our first quarter earnings call.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's all good to hear. Data center has come up multiple times already, and where the fastest growth is happening is in liquid cooling. I know you all made what looks to be a great investment in Liquid Stack. The business is still really fragmented, and you see opportunities where you can invest further there because that's where you're seeing plus 30% growth for the next several years in that technology. You have a right to be in that business and a right to win, but you'll have to invest. What are the expectations?\n\nDave Regnery",
    "content2": "Chair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, Dean, I appreciate your insights in emerging cooling. I think you did a great piece on that. Appreciate that, educating really the industry on the possibilities that we have with emerging cooling. Look, we're still very bullish. Our view hasn't changed. We're working through the technology, really on the fluid itself. That's continuing to evolve. We also believe it's a big opportunity. If you think about it, I mean, think about data centers. It's a massive market today. Think about the growth rates that are going to happen over the next five years. Whether you choose the high teens compound annual growth rate or you're in the 20s, it's a large growth number.\nThe technology is going to continue to evolve. I think that emerging cooling could be one of those technologies of the future. We're certainly right in the middle of it, as you said, and we're going to continue to be bullish on that.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Dean.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Today, you've been fielding a few questions on price. Let's have a couple more pricing questions. What's really kind of struck me is that some of your competitors, some of your larger competitors, are actually going out with very aggressive price increases and really guiding for pretty significant realized price increases. Your message is very, very different. In your experience, have you seen situations where the market has this divergence on price? Does it tend to lead to share shifts? It just feels like it's unsustainable, this gap here. Any thoughts? Just kind of a sub-question to that would be the service fleets.\nYou've got obviously a lot of labor inflation to deal with there. I mean, would you expect service pricing to be better than that 1%?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Let me just start. I'll let Chris talk about price. Nigel, I think it's always important to look at the history on pricing. If you remember, we were really early with pricing, right? That's really because of our business operating system, we were able to see around that corner. You really have to go back in history and kind of look at what we did early on versus maybe some of our competitors are catching up a little bit. Chris, I'll let you answer the rest of the question.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think that's where it starts, Dave, right? '21, '22, even '23, we really saw where we led on price there. We're being strategic, Nigel, as we think about that. Again, the 1% guide for the year right now, it's early in the year. We'll see how we do as we move throughout the year. Services, what we would look at is we'd look at wage inflation, look at the demand out there in the marketplace, and make sure we're pricing appropriately. We're also not there, and we've said this for many years. We're really not out there to try to gouge our customers. What we were trying to do was offset inflation a few years ago with price.\nWe want customers for life, and we're going to think about that as we move through the process here. We don't see pricing moving backwards here in the businesses. Again, the 1% guide, it's just early in the year. We'll update you as we move throughout it.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. It sounds, obviously, you guide them for about $1.7 to 1.8 billion of capital deployment in 2024, consistent with what you did in 2023. Obviously, tough to know how much of that's going to be buybacks versus M&A. As you do more M&A, the amortization is going to be increasingly a burden to your GAAP EPS. I know I asked this question last year about a move to cash EPS, but is that something that's under consideration?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nWe'll give it some thought as we move throughout. You're right on amortization. It's actually really the main driver with the Nuvolo acquisition that we wanted to call out with higher amortization, non-cash, accounting rule-based, shorter-lived assets in terms of how you amortize those with a high-technology business that's a youngish company. Yeah, we'll watch it as we go forward. I really like our cash EPS in 2023. I calculated that after knowing your question was going to come up with 103% conversion on cash to net income. I like our cash EPS.\nWe have lots of opportunities still within our working capital, especially in inventory, to make sure we have that level set. That'll be a nice opportunity for us on cash going forward. As we move out into future years, right, at some point, we're going to start comping against the Trane acquisition amortization, right? As we move out into the future years, we may see some of that starting to roll off as well. Not so much here in 2024, but as we look out in the future, we could start seeing that being a tailwind, let's say, on operating income. That's why we like also showing the EBITDA margins for investors, right? It takes out that noise on the amortization and just gives another metric to look at.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nRight. Okay. Thanks for details, Chris. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're welcome. Thanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andrew. How are you?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nHey, how are you? Just a question on TMS. I think you highlighted it to us back last year. My understanding is that it sort of qualifies. ITC, I think, was clarified back in November. I think there are potential more tax incentives. Does this change the game on TMS in North America, or it's just more arrows in the equivariate and just to work with your customers and to provide a good solution for them? Is that a game changer? That's the question, I guess.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI certainly think it is a game changer when you start thinking about thermal management systems and electrification of heating, and being able to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a building and have a very, very efficient system versus a conventional system. I think if you wrap all together, I'd say, sure, absolutely. It's a game changer. It's making its way around the world as we launch it in different regions, and continue to see more of that in the future.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nYeah. I guess I was referring to is the tax credit a game changer? No, I know you're excited about the technology.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou know I think any policy or tax credit becomes tailwinds. I don't think they're the only driver. I think the main driver of these systems is they're very, very efficient. They're very sustainable. They have great paybacks with or without any kind of policy or tax credit. Tax credit will be a benefit to it, but it's not the only thing that's driving it.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nNo, that makes sense. As we think about inventory in the channel and the refrigerant change both on residential and light commercial, how do you see, I think you addressed inventory on residential, but how do you see it playing out on light commercial? I know it's sort of hard to pin down what qualifies as light commercial. The second question is, does it introduce different seasonality first half versus second half for the unitary business? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I really don't. I think last year, the EPA came out and kind of clarified you can manufacture to the end of this year, and then you have a complete through 2025 to do the sell-through. We see that as all that was a good ruling by the EPA. We support that. It gives the channel time to do proper sell-through. We see that all as positive. I don't see any different dynamic there on the light unitary. I'm defining light unitary as less than 25 tons. It will really be the same dynamic that we're seeing in Rez.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nHow big is under 25 tons for you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt's a large portion of our unitary business, but we also have this great applied business, Andrew, that's even bigger.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYour line is open. Appreciate it. Thanks. You talked earlier about some of the digital investments you're making this year. You appointed a Chief Digital Officer in December, which seemed like a pretty significant milestone. Just to help us understand, is there more of a digital transformation opportunity internally over the next few years, or is this more about adding offerings to your quiver? Maybe you can get a little bit deeper into some of the focus areas for those digital investments, cyber, digital twin, etc.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I would tell you we've been in the digital space for a long time, okay? Digital twins are not new to us. Connected solutions are not new to us. I think that bringing Riaz on board, which he's just a fantastic talent in early days, is just doing a great job. It's just creating a huge focus. We believe that digitalization is a big part of our future, and Riaz is going to help us see the opportunities that exist. With Riaz, you take Nuvolo that we've added on. You think about what we're doing with digital twins. There's a lot of opportunities there.\nYou think about the level that we're seeing in our service business today, the growth rates we're seeing. Just think of that even getting stronger with a digital application in the future.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAppreciate that, Dave. Maybe the last question. I think around this time last year, you shared with us your view of where backlog would end. You said greater than $6 billion exiting 2023. It's $6.9 billion. You clearly surpassed that. Can you share with us today where you see it ending 2024?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I would just say that expect our backlog to remain elevated for several periods. Look, we're at $6.9 billion right now. It's the same level we were at when we entered 2023, so it's very strong. I think one thing I would say is the composition of the backlog is changing quite a bit. As we went through 2023, it's now like 90%+ commercial HVAC. Think of that as applied systems, which has that long service tail associated with it. A lot of demand in the verticals, data centers, etc., really require applied systems. We're very happy with our performance there.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAppreciate that, color. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be around to answer any questions you have in the coming days and weeks. We'll also be attending a number of the upcoming conferences as we enter the big conference season, and we hope to have the opportunity to connect with many of you there soon. Have a great day, and we'll talk to you soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. This concludes today."

Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and everyone for joining us on today's call. I'd like to begin with a few comments on our purpose: to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world. Our purpose is at the heart of our strategy, which is aligned to powerful megatrends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Coming off the hottest summer on record, we see policies aimed at decarbonizing the built environment continuing to expand. We see growing sustainability commitments for our customers, our suppliers, and for our investors. We see corporations not only setting goals but taking action. We are their partner of choice. We have the technology to help bend the curve on climate change. That's exactly what we're doing. We are scaling today's technology and relentlessly innovating for tomorrow to meet our customers' needs to dramatically reduce emissions.\nThis enables us to consistently outgrow our end markets and deliver differentiated financial results. The end result is long-term value creation for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet. Moving to slide number 4, our global team performed extremely well in Q3, setting us up for a strong 2023 and positioning us well for 2024. We delivered strong organic growth of 9% and leveraged throughout the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 23% and powerful free cash flow. We continue to see very strong customer demand for our products and services, with the enterprise bookings at an all-time high of nearly $5 billion in the quarter. Bookings were exceptionally strong in our commercial HVAC businesses globally, with organic bookings growth of low to mid-teens in all segments.\nOur Americas commercial HVAC business was once again a standout, with organic bookings of mid-teens in the quarter and up approximately 65% on a three-year stack. Enterprise backlog ended the quarter at $6.9 billion, with the composition shifting increasingly towards commercial HVAC. Year to date, backlog in commercial HVAC is up approximately $800 million. Over the past three years, our commercial HVAC backlog has nearly tripled, up approximately 170%. As residential and Thermo King have normalized, the backlog burn in these businesses has been completely offset by growth in commercial HVAC backlog, including a large percentage of long-cycle applied systems. We continue to drive strong demand and a healthy pipeline of projects in key growth verticals across our commercial HVAC businesses.\nWe're leveraging the power of our direct sales force, which brings specific expertise on how to customize solutions and leverage policy, programs, and incentives to optimize customers' paybacks, total cost of ownership, and performance. Our leading innovation and unique direct go-to-market strategy enables us to quickly pivot and win in the highest growth verticals as markets evolve. We have a resilient and diverse portfolio, and our business operating system is designed to deliver consistent top quartile performance. As our residential business has normalized and transport markets have softened, our overall business has delivered strong results and is on track to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth and 20% plus adjusted EPS growth for the year, our third consecutive year of 20% or higher adjusted EPS growth.\nWe're on pace to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than 100% of net earnings, and continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy with high levels of business reinvestment, a strong and growing dividend, strategic bolt-on M&A, and share repurchases. Our strong execution, robust bookings and revenue growth, and exceptional backlog gives us confidence in raising our 2023 guidance, and confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance in 2024 as well. Please go to slide number 5. Demand for our innovative products and services continues to be broad-based across our segments, highlighting the strength of our global portfolio. Organic bookings were up 8%, led by our commercial HVAC businesses. In the Americas, commercial HVAC was very strong across the board.\nWe discussed booking strength on the prior slide, but revenues were exceptional as well, up in the low 20% range, with equipment up approximately 30% and services up low teens. Our residential business continues to normalize as expected, with revenues up low single digit. Consistent with our prior comments, the nature of our transport refrigeration business is lumpy, and our performance in Q3 was in line with our expectations on both bookings and revenues. Revenues were a bit lower than our guidance of down 10%, driven by the timing of customer deliveries between Q2 and Q3, but remained strong against a tough 60% prior year growth comp. On a two-year stack, revenues were up more than 40% in the quarter. Americas backlog is approximately 3x historical norms, with the largest component being commercial HVAC applied systems for 2024 and beyond.\nApplied systems are the most complex and innovative systems, and the largest driver of our service business in commercial HVAC. Our EMEA business was right on track with our expectations. Bookings were strong in both businesses, both up low teens. Commercial HVAC revenues were robust, with mid-single-digit growth on tough prior year comps. TK AMEA revenues were up versus a down market. Backlog remained strong, approximately 60% higher than historical norms, and predominantly commercial HVAC. Our Asia-Pacific business performed well, with strong bookings growth in China and the rest of Asia. Asia revenues were slightly lower against a tough prior year comp of nearly 30% growth. Our outlook for the region continues to be positive. The verticals we play in remain strong, with good opportunities for future growth. Asia segment backlog continues to be robust as we approach 2024, approximately 70% above historical norms, and predominantly commercial HVAC.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 6. The scoreboard for the quarter highlights strong execution, top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 9%. Adjusted operating and EBITDA margins were up 130 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 23%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single digits and low teens, respectively. We continue to highlight our exceptional services growth because our services business continues to differentiate us in our industry. It makes Trane Technologies more resilient, with higher recurring revenues at higher margins over time, and represents about 1/3 of our enterprise revenues. Over the past six years, including 2020, our services business delivered a revenue growth CAGR of up high single digits, and we're driving even stronger growth in 2023.\nOur high-performance flywheel continues to deliver results, with relentless investment in innovation driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth. Please turn to slide number 7. As an enterprise, we delivered about 5 points of volume and about 4 points of price in the quarter. Strong volume growth, positive price realization, and productivity combined to more than offset inflation in the quarter. The supply chain continues to stabilize, enabling improving productivity as we move throughout the year. In the Americas segment, we delivered about 7 points of volume and 4 points of price, with accompanied strong leverage and margin expansion led by our commercial HVAC business, more than offsetting volume declines in transport. The EMEA segment delivered very strong organic incrementals and margin expansion, with organic revenues up low single digits in the quarter.\nThe segment also delivered approximately 12 points of M&A growth in the quarter, which impacted reported leverage given year-one integration costs. The Asia segment delivered strong margin expansion and organic leverage in the quarter on slightly down revenues. For the enterprise, we earmarked an additional +30 basis points for incremental business reinvestment in 2023 to accelerate the timing of key projects across the enterprise. This nearly doubles our average run rate of approximately 40 basis points annually, for a total of +70 basis points in 2023. We're extremely pleased we've been able to make these incremental investments in 2023 while driving strong leverage. We see a tight linkage between investments in innovation and market outgrowth, and we're taking opportunities to go further and faster in 2023.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 8. Overall, our positive outlook for our segments and our end markets is largely unchanged from the prior quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, with continued high levels of absolute demand, exceptional backlog, and strong execution, we're gaining additional visibility into healthy growth in 2024. Across the enterprise, there are some key themes. Strong demand for our sustainability-focused solutions remains high. While we expect the law of large numbers to kick in at some point and for ordered growth to decline, absolute bookings are expected to remain robust, given our new baseline is at a very high level. Across our businesses, we see the stacking effect of supportive policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strengths as a leading climate innovator.\nIn addition to all the tailwinds at a national level in both the US and Europe, we see activity at the state and municipal levels, and our direct sales force is able to help customers leverage these programs. In Americas commercial HVAC, our business is extremely strong, as we've outlined. We're winning with customers and developing innovative solutions in data centers, education, and high tech, just to name a few strong verticals. We're driving tremendous growth in our applied business, which makes up the majority of our backlog. Applied business is the most differentiated and complex, and it's where our competitive advantages shine. It's long cycle with higher margin service opportunities representing a multiple of initial purchase price over the life of the system. Additionally, this business helps to forge long-term relationships with customers as they move from project to project over a multi-year period.\nWe have the most comprehensive portfolio of products in the industry, which enables us to compete and win across all verticals, driving leading, long-term, sustainable growth. There's no change to our residential business outlook. We expect residential to continue to normalize through the fourth quarter, and for the normalization process to be largely complete in 2023. Also, as expected, strength in commercial HVAC is more than offsetting the decline in residential in 2023. Our transport refrigeration business was largely in line with our expectations in the third quarter and up more than 40% on a two-year stack. We expect to outperform the market for the year. ACT is projecting a dip in 2024 and a bounce back in 2025, and continued growth afterwards. However, ACT's forecast has been volatile in recent months, and we are in the process of validating assumptions versus our internal forecast and other sources. We'll update the market when we hold our year-end earnings call.\nIn our EMEA segment, the third quarter was also in line with our expectations for both businesses. As we highlighted in our second quarter call, EMEA HVAC has very tough comps in both the third and fourth quarters, up high 20s and low 40s respectively, and revenue growth is expected to be more moderate in the second half. The two-year stack for Q3 is up more than 30%. Our transport refrigeration outlook is unchanged. Likewise, our Asia-Pacific segment, our outlook for the full year is unchanged. Revenue in the second half is expected to be flattish, purely related to tough prior year comps, while bookings continue to be strong. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 9. Strong execution, record bookings, and near-record backlog puts us in an excellent position as we move into the fourth quarter. We're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. Organic revenue growth is expected to be between 8-9%, up from our prior guidance of up approximately 8%, reflecting strong Q3 performance and a largely unchanged outlook for a robust Q4. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $9, up from a range of $8.80 to 8.90, mainly reflecting a flow-through of our third quarter outperformance versus our guidance, and continued strong leverage of 30% plus for the fourth quarter. We're pleased with our free cash flow performance of approximately $1.3 billion year-to-date. On the full year, we continue to expect to deliver powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than adjusted net earnings, or approximately $2 billion.\nAs we've highlighted before, we pay close attention to our investment peer group and consistently target top quartile financial performance, including adjusted EPS growth, and adjusted free cash flow conversion. We believe our guidance places us in a strong position to deliver against that target in 2023. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect an increased M&A contribution in the second half versus the first half due to the timing of acquisitions. We had approximately three points of M&A in the third quarter and expect to have approximately two points of M&A in the fourth quarter as one acquisition passes the one-year mark and is included in our base. There is no change to our full-year guidance of approximately two points from M&A. Please see slide 19 of the presentation for additional details related to guidance to assist with your models. Please go to slide number 10.\nWe remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023, including $60 million, which will be realized in 2023. We continue to invest in these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. Our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been extremely difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years, given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity is improving as supply chain challenges abate and is contributing to our 30% plus organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders.\nFirst, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. In 2023, we received upgrades to our credit ratings, which are now Baa1, BBB+, reflective of our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023. Year-to-date, as of the end of October, we've deployed $1.6 billion in cash, with $513 million to dividends, $535 million to M&A, and $550 million to share repurchases.\nWe have significant dry powder, with over $2.6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have deployed or committed approximately $900 million year-to-date as of the end of October to bolt on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments. Our latest acquisition, Nuvolo, was announced in early October. Nuvolo will augment our energy services, enterprise management, and digital capabilities in commercial HVAC. We expect a Nuvolo transaction to close in the fourth quarter. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 14. Transport refrigeration market forecasts for both North America and EMEA remain unchanged, and we expect to outperform each market in 2023. Our performance through the third quarter is on track to meet these expectations. The slide shows key data points on the markets and on Thermo King specifically, to provide additional transparency and reference information. Please go to slide number 15. As discussed, ACT's projections for 2024 have been volatile, and we are focused on conducting a thorough analysis of the markets. In the interim, we've included ACT's most recent forecast for 2023 through 2028 for your reference. Please go to slide number 16. We expect to provide 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. However, given increasing visibility, we believe it may be constructive to discuss key dynamics at play that give us confidence we'll see healthy growth in 2024.\nOur commercial HVAC businesses, which make up roughly 65% of our total revenues, are executing well in healthy markets, and the agility of our sales teams to quickly pivot focus to growing vertical markets is driving record bookings and backlog. Our applied backlog is a standout and provides a long, higher-margin service tail that makes our business stronger and more resilient. Secular megatrends continue to support growth, and policy and regulatory stacking is amplifying these tailwinds, with the majority of these programs still ahead of us. We expect to enter 2024 with our residential business largely through the normalization process and on path to our long-term target of GDP plus growth. We continue to lead with innovation, which yields healthy pricing opportunities, and our business operating system is primed to stay ahead of inflationary pressures. The supply chain is vastly improved, and pockets of remaining challenges continue to abate.\nOur culture is lean-based, and we're excited about the productivity we can unlock as we move into 2024. We've also been heavily investing in productivity-enhancing projects, such as factory automation, which we expect to unlock further value. ACT is forecasting a dip in North America trailer production in 2024, a snapback in 2025, and growth thereafter. While we're in the process of further assessing their forecast, our North America transport refrigeration business is approximately 10% of our total revenues. We expect to execute well, manage the business tightly, outperform the end markets, and, if necessary, manage deleverage within gross margin rates. Lastly, while we don't talk about our service business a lot, we're quietly putting up double-digit growth in 2023, on top of a six-year compound annual growth rate of high single-digit growth.\nOur service business is strong, resilient, and poised for growth, and we continue to build out our energy services and digital capabilities and offerings, which represents a big current and even larger future opportunity. Please go to slide number 17. In summary, we are well-positioned to drive significant value over time. We are proud to have been named one of Fortune's best workplaces for women, and one of the world's best companies by Time Magazine. Our culture and people fuel our innovation, and help us to fulfill our purpose every day. This steadfast focus on purpose, our leading innovation, and our proven business operating system enables us to execute our strategy and stay nimble across our resilient portfolio. This, in turn, enables us to consistently deliver a leading revenue and earnings growth profile, and powerful free cash flow.\nWith our strong performance, elevated backlog, and continued high levels of customer demand, we are confident in once again raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance, and reaffirming our free cash flow conversion target. We have the team, the strategy, and the track record to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, please press star one. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, Dave and Chris and Zach.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm kind of getting sick of congratulating you on good quarters, but this is one of the better ones.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nPlease keep it up.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYou're making Lehigh proud, Dave. All good. Guys, when you think about the backlog that you have and the demand environment in commercial, is this the type of environment where you can really be selective on projects and kind of cherry-pick the stuff that has really the price, margin structure that you want? Is that not kind of how it works, and you're just out there bidding on a wider array of stuff, but just bidding at a higher price? I'm just trying to get a sense of that interplay between project selectivity and really just the supply-demand imbalance that's out there right now.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Scott, it's a good question. We have strong core business right now, and we spend a lot on innovation, and we price our innovation to ensure that we get proper returns. I would say it's leading more with innovation, and we're constantly looking for how we can improve our portfolio, how we can improve the efficiency of our products, how our products can use next-generation low GWP refrigerants. That's all inclusive in our business operating system when it comes to innovation, and that's what's really leading our markets right now. I would also tell you that having this—and I know I've told you this before—but this direct sales force and being able to educate them on new innovations real-time and having them take those messages to the influencers on jobs is very, very important when you go to close, especially some of these large applied jobs.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah, that's helpful color. I have to ask this question. You have a competitor who had a ransomware issue in the quarter. Did that help you guys as it related to bidding on things and such, or was that a non-event?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt was a non-event, I hope everything's okay there, but it was a non-event.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, I'll pass it on. Thank you again.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nIndustrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. I think, Dave, you emphasized a couple of times the strength in applied bookings and the difference versus light commercial because of the service element. Maybe just a follow-up on that point would be around sort of what's the rough split today of, say, the revenues in your commercial HVAC business between applied and light commercial? I just wondered, when you're looking at the revenue outlook next 12 months, do you anticipate much of a difference in revenue trends of applied versus light commercial, maybe because of stimulus impacts or the scale of the respective backlogs? Any sort of perspective around that, please?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Julian, we don't look at just light. We look at units or in total, so it'd be light and large. Historically, it's been about 50/50 in our equipment business. Obviously, in the third quarter, we had very, very strong demand in our applied business. Think of data centers, high-tech, education. We're very strong. We had solid performance in other verticals too, like healthcare, life science, government, and industrial. There were some weaker verticals as well. Think of traditional office, warehousing, and retail. Those weaker verticals are where you tend to see more unitary than applied systems.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nIndustrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you. Just my follow-up. It's more of a sort of silly short-term one, but only one quarter left in the year. Your sales guide, I think your Q4 sort of construct on guidance is the same as it was back in July, and you just kind of flowed through the Q3 beat to your full-year guide. If I wanted to look at the Q4 for what that's worth, the revenue guide implies nearly, I think, sort of 8%, 9% sequential sales decline from Q3, which seems a bit heavier than normal. Is that just kind of noise around backing out from the year, or is there anything specific, maybe in transport or something like that, that's weighing on Q4?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian, it's Chris. I'll start off. The Q4 implied guide is kind of around mid-single digits, organic revenue growth. It is a little bit of a step down versus Q3, but if we put a few reasons behind it, one is when I think about the toughest comp of the year, our commercial HVAC businesses, this is really the toughest comp across the board going into the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Second would be the contribution from price. We would expect to be a bit lower in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We commented price delivered around 4% of growth in Q3. We probably dial that into about 2%-ish of growth in Q4. There's about 2% right there sequentially. Maybe just to round out another response here, it really would be around residential as it continues to normalize.\nWe did a little better in the third quarter on revenues. Our constructive view around residential for the full year hasn't changed, with revenues down around mid-single digits. We're very focused on making sure inventory in the channel is positioned well for the start of 2024. We would expect that normalization to continue really into the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of some view here on how we think about Q3 to Q4. Let's not forget maybe the first point, the commercial HVAC on tough comps. We had 40% growth in EMEA last year, 30% growth in Asia last year. Really toughest comp of the quarter.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nIndustrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat makes sense. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're welcome. Thanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Impressive quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, thanks, Andy. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nDave, with the understanding that orders can be lumpy, it appears that you actually had a positive inflection in orders in Americas commercial HVAC in the quarter despite concerns of higher US rates. Did you see larger mega projects start to hit a little more frequently in the quarter? I know you mentioned strength in data centers. Did you see some of your bigger verticals actually heat up a bit as the quarter went on? Would you say that that gives you more of a probability of ending backlog at the end of this year closer to $7 billion than $6 billion, as I know you're guiding?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we're still tracking a lot of mega projects, and we're defining a mega project again as a project where the total revenue will be over—the total size of it is over $1 billion. We're still tracking a lot of those in our pipeline. Yeah, we had a little bit of activity in the third quarter, but we just had some really nice growth. I mean, as I said earlier, data centers, education continues to be very strong. We had what I would call solid performance over a lot of different verticals: healthcare, life science, government, industrial. Those are all very solid performance in the quarter. I think a lot of the mega projects are yet to come, which is still good news.\nI think I've told you on our second quarter call, our ability to track these projects and to triage them on a global basis because some of these big mega projects, you have decision-makers that are in different parts of the world. You could have the owner in Korea, you could have the engineer in Seattle, Washington, and the project is in Texas. We're able to triage that and work with the customer and show the value that we can provide. We're super excited about a lot of the mega projects that are still in the pipeline.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that. Chris, could you give more color into the organic leverage you've been delivering? Organic leverage in the mid-30% range is obviously a good result for Trane. We know you're gone to 30% for Q4 and 25% plus long-term, but maybe you could talk about whether you have an extended period of productivity projects along with good price versus cost that could help your margin perform as well in 2024, given I think it was more difficult to engage these projects during the pandemic.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andy, it's a great question. I would say we go into every year looking at incrementals in the 25% or better category, right? We'll dial that in as we get a little closer to 2024. We continue to see this dovetail of the contributions from growth price normalizing with the gross productivity getting better as we've worked through the quarters this year. The supply chain has continued to improve with that. The volume growth has continued to grow each and every quarter. We delivered around 5 points of volume growth here in the third quarter. With that, the inefficiencies, as you said, it was hard to get that productivity the last couple of years. The inefficiencies have gotten less. There's a lot of room to go here.\nWe're starting to see some of the benefits of that in 2023, but this will be a continued opportunity for us as we go into 2024, really and beyond. We're really getting back to the DNA of the company, right? The ability for us to drive the lean culture, look at cost takeout, and ultimately lean through with automation in our factories. These are all investments we're making this year, and we're able to pivot the workforce to focus on that versus the supply chain challenges of the last few years.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andy, I had the opportunity to visit several of our locations during the quarter, and it was just such a great feeling to feel the flow that's happening in the operations today versus where we were a year ago, where we were looking at the yard full of product that had to go back on the line to be reworked. That's all helping with the productivity. We're really starting to hit our stride here in our operations, which is a great job by the team because they've had some tough times there working through the supply chain, but I'm glad to say that they're operating extremely well right now.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate all the color, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Gotham McCollum of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning, and great quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Gotham. Appreciate it.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nJust wanted to get your sense on—you mentioned transport refrigeration. You opened the order books in October. Any early read on how demand looks, and how far out you're booking into 2024 right now?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, like I said, we did open the order book in October as expected, Gotham. I mean, the Thermo King business has performed very well for us over a number of years. With our current guide, we're forecasting that we're going to outperform the markets again in 2023. It's a great business. We have a lot of innovation that we're pumping through that business right now as we electrify our portfolio of products. Great team, and I'm pretty excited about where we are with Thermo King. I know that ACT is forecasting a bit of a dip in 2024. We're validating that. There are some things that don't align up with our internal forecast, but we'll validate that in the short term and update everyone as we report out our fourth quarter earnings.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Can you comment on how far out you guys are actually booking into 2024 at this point, or?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt's always within a 12-month period. These orders don't get booked way out. In fact, in the prior years, we were only opening up the book for six-month increments, just because we wanted to make sure we had pricing right when we were in a higher inflation market.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I think for Americas, it may open through middle of 2024, Gotham. I think for Europe, it may be open for a bit longer than that. To Dave's point, the order book would really only be for 2024 at this point.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Just one quick follow-up on Resi. Any evidence of people differing replacement and instead repairing units? Are you seeing any uptick in those products?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I was with the Resi team recently. We're not seeing that. No, I think the short answer is no. We haven't seen that yet.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask on commercial HVAC. Orders this quarter clearly bifurcated from the broader industry. The company has always prided itself on driving innovation. I guess my question is, with the world moving to emissions targets and just higher electricity prices globally, are you seeing customers more so appreciate the innovation and efficiency that you are providing to them? Do you think that could result in a higher rate of share gains moving forward? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Chris. Hope all's well with you. Great question. Look, we always lead with innovation. I think our customers always appreciate higher-efficient products, greener products using low GWP refrigerants. We pride ourselves on that. We do a lot of innovation around verticals. I don't talk a lot about that for obvious reasons, but if you think of data centers, we had a very strong quarter in data centers. A lot of that has to do with the innovation that we're providing working with the customer. These are unique solutions for them, and then they scale it through all the data centers that they're building. We'll continue to do that in the future. We'll continue to sell our energy efficiency to our customers, and we'll continue to make sure that we have connected solutions so that our service business can continue to expand in the future.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I appreciate that. Maybe following up, Dave, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that orders need to go down at some point due to the law of large numbers. I guess my question is, would we need a step change negative in the macro to see that? It feels like the lead time compression headwinds are kind of largely in the rearview at this point. Commercial's healthy, Resi seems to be turning, and you mentioned before the mega projects really haven't ordered yet. It's mostly still in the pipeline. I mean, what do we need to see in a macro standpoint to have material order declines off these levels? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Chris, it's Chris. I'll start. This is why we want to make sure it's important that investors look at growth rates as well as backlog position, and just absolute bookings levels, right? I think the trends around decarbonization and, as you mentioned just before, customers putting out emissions targets, we see these as long-term tailwinds. Growth around data centers appears to be a multi-year tailwind as we think about the need for data, for saving data, and to process data. We see this as some longer-term tailwinds. When we think about the beginning of the year, we guided ending backlog down to around $6 billion, and that would have implied bookings down around 5-6%. Even on a down 5% or 6, that would have been still very elevated levels in terms of absolute bookings.\nWe continue to see that strength here through the third quarter. I would say the trends we do not necessarily see as abating. Could we find some quarters where the backlog will start to normalize or bookings growth will be negative? I guess we could. I would just encourage people to look at absolute bookings levels because when you look at two-year stacks, three-year stacks around bookings growth, they are significant. You think about commercial HVAC in the Americas, a three-year booking stack of over 65%. The fact is, if we went down five points in a given period, you still have to subtract that from 65% points of growth. Maybe a bit of a long answer to your question, but we are confident we have got a long-term tailwind here.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe. Appreciate it.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYesterday, Eaton resized the mega project funnel up 25%, now tracking almost close to $900 billion. They suggested that about 20% of the projects have kind of broken ground, and a lower percentage they've actually bid. I'm curious. I know that you guys have your own funnel, and you guys are also tracking projects over a billion dollars. Does that all kind of jive with what you're seeing in your pipeline broadly, or any other color around that would be helpful?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I haven't read Eaton's report, so I can't comment specifically. I would just tell you that we have a lot of projects in the pipeline right now that we're tracking. I think you always have to be a little bit careful when you track one company versus another company when orders are procured by different companies could vary. Eaton may be a bit before us, but I guess the good news is we still see a lot out there, and it sounds like Eaton does as well. We're very, very confident with many of the solutions that we have that we're talking with customers about, and we feel that on many of these projects, we're in a unique position.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Maybe following up on that, Dave, have you had any concerns? I know you're not seeing it really in your order book today, but are there any concerns out there on project financing or things pushing to the right just given the rate environment that we're in?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJoe, it's Chris. No, we're not. I think while certainly interest rates have gone in a negative direction on paybacks, I would tell you that the change in paybacks is minor when we think about the energy-efficient systems that we're able to quote customers. A payback may have gone from two, two and a half years to three-ish years now with interest rates. The fact is there's still very strong paybacks when you're implementing some of these solutions. We're not seeing that right now.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That makes sense. I guess maybe one last one quickly for you, Chris. I know that we're kind of not ready to bless any 2024 numbers at this point, but as you kind of think through both pricing and mix for next year, just any thoughts, initial thoughts on how that should kind of play out across the Americas business?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We'll dial in a little bit further, Joe, as we get a couple of months from now. We do target from a price inflation measure, let's say a spread of 20 to 30 basis points in a normal year. We'll dial that in as we get closer to next year. To Dave's earlier point, we're making sure we're pricing for innovation, and also long-term customer relationships. I'm confident that we'll have a good set of numbers there. We're going to target positive on a dollar basis and a margin basis on price versus inflation. We've been able to demonstrate that for the last three years, so I have a lot of confidence our teams will be able to do that going forward.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey. Morning, Steve. How are you?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. I'll echo those orders. Pretty strong, for sure. There's been a lot of strength in light commercial. How strong was your light commercial business, large and light?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOur revenue was up in the Americas, was up over 20%. Equipment was up over 30%. Applied was stronger than unitary.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nApplied was stronger than unitary.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYes. Both were strong, but applied was stronger than unitary. I mean, you could look at the verticals that really had the strength in it, Steve. Data centers, high-tech, education. Those tend to be more applied systems. Even the verticals that were solid, like healthcare, life science, again, those tend to be the more intricate projects where you need to really design system, which is our applied system. We're pretty happy with the performance that we saw in the third quarter. Again, not to reiterate, but these applied, I know you know this, but this is where you get the long service tail. This is going to continue to fuel our service business in the future.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Can you just give us maybe a little—I know you kind of—you haven't done this before, but you've mentioned these four verticals in every slide presentation for the last several years. Obviously, you guys are doing a great job there. Can you just give us—given it's so important now, I mean, commercial HVAC, 65% of your revenue base—can you just give us some sort of color on how much those four verticals represent now? I mean, is that like 50% of your portfolio, just roughly how much those growthy verticals represent?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThey're strong, Steve, is what I would answer. We track about 14 verticals in the Americas. Certainly, office and warehousing would be areas. Retail, that'd be a little bit weaker today. I know the office vertical has a number of things kind of buried in it today. We've been lobbying to try to break that out just given demand on warehouse and data centers. We won't dial it in specifically, but we like our positioning here. What I think is, again, most important with the direct sales force is their ability that if a vertical is slower, like office, the ability to pivot into another vertical is really a testament to that. [crosstalk]\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat's exactly where I was going to go, Chris. I mean, these verticals, we track 14. You could even get 18 if you do a little subdividing there. Oftentimes, when one vertical is stronger than another vertical for an extended period of time, I'll use warehousing as an example. Two years ago, three years ago, warehousing was extremely strong. We pivot our sales force to focus on warehousing, we develop programs for them, and they go capture share in those particular verticals. Right now, the strength in data centers, I don't see that going away in the near term. High-tech, we have all the mega projects that are really in front of us, and education. Education's been strong. Obviously, ESSER funding is helping that. I think ESSER funding is probably in the fifth or sixth inning, but we've been extremely strong in education for an extended period of time.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOne last one for you. Your peers have talked about this refrigerant change and Resi driving some pretty nice price mix, 10-15% or something like that over the next couple of years, perhaps a bit more back-end loaded into 2025 given the change comes then. Can you just give us your latest and greatest lens on price and mix from that transition and what potentially you could see in 2024 and 2025 on that front for Resi?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. The short answer is we're dialing it in. I mean, if you think about the whole refrigerant change, right, we've been leading with refrigerant change, really the industry. I think we've been at it since about 2013 with next-generation refrigerants. We're more than ready for this transition away from 410 to, in our case, 454B. Our designs are complete, our manufacturing is ready to go, and we're going to start up production here in early Q2. All systems go there. There are some definitions, Steve, that we're still working with the EPA to make sure our interpretation is correct. Really, our focus is going to shift to the channel to make sure we have a clean phase in, phase out of inventory.\nWe will be manufacturing both 410 product and 454 product in 2024 and probably even into 2025, at least our interpretation right now, what we're seeing with the EPA. As far as price, we're still dialing that in. The 454 product is going to be more expensive. Obviously, it's a slightly flammable refrigerant, so you're going to have to put different sensing equipment around the unit. We will get more data on that in the coming weeks here, and we'll update everyone on our fourth quarter call.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Jeff Sprig of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprig\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you?\n\nJeff Sprig\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research",
    "content2": "Hey, I'm doing great. Not as good as you guys, but doing well. Thank you. I wonder if we could just dig a little bit more into just customer behavior and backlogs. As big as the backlogs are versus history, right, if I think about 90% of $6 billion, maybe it's $6 billion plus, right, but that would be, call it my math, roughly half of your 2024 commercial revenues are in backlog. I mean, that's a good, healthy number. But given the size and scope of some of these projects, maybe it goes back a little bit to one of the earlier questions. I'm not sure why backlog would really go down much from here.\nDo you actually see customers just kind of changing their order patterns, or there's kind of something else that would suggest that backlogs really do need to kind of go back down towards where they were historically?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJeff, I'll start. I mean, I think the lead times are still a bit extended in Applied Systems, getting better certainly from where we were at the beginning of the year. Same in Unitary, getting better. So I think as the lead times come in a bit, you may see where the backlog contracts a bit over time. It is elevated today. You're right. 90% of the backlog would relate to our global commercial HVAC business. And when you think about our commercial businesses, including Thermo King, it's over 95%. So it gives us a lot of visibility into what we think 2024 would be with some healthy growth. But let's see how the policy stacking effects that continue to positively affect us and the order rates. Mega projects, as Dave said, are ahead of us here in terms of bookings. And Applied, these are long-cycle kind of projects.\nLet's see how this plays out. We think it could be elevated for longer, but it will start to normalize at some point.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think the only thing I would add to that, Jeff, is I'll go back to data centers again. And kind of our strategy was to work with the data center engineers and develop solutions that are optimal for them. Once we do that, they do tend to lock in for an extended period of time with you. So they'll provide orders beyond your lead times just to ensure that they have slots available and we don't disappoint by missing a shipment.\n\nJeff Sprig\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nAnd can you gauge in any way what percent of this forward project pipeline is tied to various stimulus programs, be they IRA, chips, other things, and what's coming down through the state promulgations?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJeff, I would say from an IRA perspective, that's really all in front of us. I don't think that's necessarily in the backlog today. But from an ESSER funding for several years now, we've had projects and making sure that over the summer months when schools are open, we're ready to service and upgrade equipment. So I think that's certainly been the backlog for a while. Data centers continue to elevate, and we see there's a long-term tail. But chips and science, we don't have that dialed in, but that would be one where I guess you could specifically say this is driving this demand. But in the data center, there's no—that's more about just a pure demand for data centers right now.\n\nJeff Sprig\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nRight. Great. Thanks for the call, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. So going back to the commercial HVAC growth in 3Q, which was obviously spectacular, but especially in the Americas, the pickup Q-to-Q was quite something. So you called out, obviously, the strength in the verticals. Was there any kind of supply chain sort of loosening or kind of flush there that maybe drove that? I understand the demand's very strong. And then within that, education, I think there's some concerns out there with the stimulus funding kind of reaching a peak perhaps that maybe education falls off in 2024. So any visibility on education would be helpful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start with the latter. The education, we haven't seen it cool off yet. We still have a lot in our pipeline as well. There's still a lot of money to be spent out there. As I said, I think if we were playing baseball, I'd say we're in the sixth inning. There's still some funding to come there. And we've been strong there for an extended period of time. Other question was?\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Just obviously, supply chain constraints have been a factor.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe supply chain.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe supply chain, I wouldn't say it's normal, but it's pretty close to normal. We always have some noise that you're going to see in the supply chain, but our teams have done just a great job there. So I wouldn't say—I would not say our third quarter performance was because supply chain suddenly got better because it's been.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And then some of the comments.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nExecuting very well on the front end of our business. We're executing very well on the operation side of our business. And you really see it in our results.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thanks, Dave. Just quick, another crack at the pricing question. Chris, you mentioned 23 basis points spread versus inflation is what you target. It does feel like some of your competitors are taking a much more aggressive policy towards pricing. So I'm just curious on two aspects. Number one, the potential to really be a bit more aggressive on price as you go into 2024. And then secondly, as this commercial HVAC backlog starts to convert, is there sort of embedded pricing in that backlog that's going to emerge over the next 12 months?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start with your second question, Nigel. As we think about the backlog that runs out a year, year and a half, we're making sure that we've got the right cost escalators built in. And it could be a reference to an external index, or it could be where we've put cost inflators into the project to ultimately make sure we're pricing effectively. So I think we've got that embedded in the backlog right now on a best view. And the teams have done an outstanding job with this over the last three-plus years in the inflationary environment to stay ahead on inflation. Yeah. Look, I think pricing will remain a way for us to continue to drive with our innovative products, making sure we're pricing effectively. It's going to be healthy.\nI just want to get three more months ahead of us here before we dial it in for 2024. But I am confident that as we think about the cost environment and the innovation of our products, we're going to make sure we're pricing effectively. And again, making sure we've got long-term customer relationships here, as Dave described with the applied business, we want to make sure that the services business continues to grow with that, which it can, and it will. And that, of course, brings with itself healthy margins. So we're well-positioned for next year. Just give us a little more time to dial that in.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, great. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Dean. How are you?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, doing real well. Thank you. Maybe you circle back on China. You had good bookings. I was impressed that even though you had lighter revenues, the margins were much stronger. So how did China play out for you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI'm very happy with our performance in Asia-Pacific overall. So thanks for the question. You think about—I'll start with orders, right? I mean, orders were up in the low teens, up 12%, okay, for the region. And China had high single digits, and the rest of Asia had mid-teens. So very strong performance on order rate. On revenue, we were flattish down a bit. But remember, last year, we had 30% growth in Asia-Pacific. So it's really just a comp issue. The team there is performing very well. I was very, very happy with the incoming order rates in that region. And the pipeline is strong as well.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. And just as a follow-up to that September customer experience event in New York, can you give us a sense of, on the applied business, both the backlog and the funnel, how much are customers opting for this thermal management feature? Since you like using the baseball analogy, are we in the early innings of adoption? Where does that stand?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Thermal storage. Yeah. I mean, we have adoption that's continuous there. We've been selling thermal storage systems for quite some time. I do think that one of the elements of IRA that could accelerate that is that would be included there. And we're still dialing in what that exact rebate would be and how it will be applied. But that could be significant and really drive that. And just so everyone's aware, thermal management or thermal storage systems are great ways for energy efficiency, but they're also great ways to help balance the grid. And if you have a need in a peak period to shut off power or limit power, this is a great way to do it because you burn ice versus running your compressors on your chillers. So we're excited about the technology. We've had it for a while. IRA could be a catalyst to even have it grow faster.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Dean.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHi, Andrew. How are you?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI'm good. I'm good. So question on gross margins, I guess. Look at my model. I think gross margins are hitting all-time highs. And I know you guys don't look at other companies, but we do. And I'm just wondering how much price cost, the spread between price cost, is a benefit. And I guess the bigger question is, have we rebased gross margins? Because clearly, you guys have done a lot of work on cost cutting, right? It seems that you have an aggressive stance on maintaining the spread. But also, how much of it is timing, right? It's just the peak between the balance between price and cost. So if you could just talk about, are we in the new normal with gross margins, or should we expect the gross margins normalize somewhat going forward? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndrew, I'll start. I think about the third quarter, we really were able to execute across all parts of the P&L to drive leverage and gross margin expansion. So the price execution versus inflation, as I said earlier, was positive on a margin and dollar basis. There are areas, though, of inflation, especially in tier two around wage and energy inflation that are impacting the business. So it was a positive. The incrementals on volume, we had five points of volume in the quarter, so we liked those incrementals. And we've continued to invest in the business as well, right? We're still targeting for the full year around 70 basis points of incremental investment above a 40 basis point normal. So all parts of the P&L are really working.\nBut I would tell you the productivity opportunity for us as price comes back to a bit more of a normalized level, that is really the opportunity for us going forward to really continue to drive 25% or better incrementals.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAnd we really like our mix and service.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nSo service is what's driving higher gross margins as well?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt's a contributor, right?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt was a system of things that doesn't. But we really like the mix we have with our service business.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGreat. And just a follow-up question on Nuvolo, right? I think JCI also bought a workplace management software company. Fortive has a presence. Can you just talk about what excites you about this vertical and maybe also remind us how big a software is a business for you at this point? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Nuvolo is a cloud-based connected workplace and enterprise asset management company. And it's leveraging the ServiceNow platform. Look, we look at this as a way to augment our current digital capabilities. Just to remind everyone, we have over 36,000 connected buildings. We have well over a million connected assets. So we think this is a great company, great leadership, great technology. And we're excited to get this closed and have it be part of the trained technology portfolio. And it's going to really help us grow our digital business at a nice clip.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nAnd how big is the digital business now?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI won't be specific on that. I would say that this acquisition is less than 1% of the enterprise revenue.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay, thanks, Todd.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, thanks, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have completed the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZachary Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be available in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have. Please don't hesitate to reach out. Stay safe, and we look forward to seeing everyone soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zac, and everyone for joining us on today's call. Let me begin with a few comments on our purpose as a company: to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world. Our purpose is at the heart of our strategy, which is linked to powerful megatrends like climate change. This enables us to drive differentiated financial results and shareholder returns over the long term. The recent news on climate change has been sobering. Water temperatures off the Florida coast recently soared to over 100 degrees.\nWe've seen deadly heat waves in parts of the United States, Europe, and Asia in one of the Earth's hottest summers on record. In fact, scientists say these temperatures are likely the warmest the planet has seen in 120,000 years and have dangerous effects on the environment, the economy, and human life. Urgent action is needed to limit global warming and preserve our planet for the next generation. Our customers are seeking sustainable solutions and choosing Trane Technologies as their partner in decarbonizing the built environment and the cold chain. We are leading the way with our innovation.\nThe end result is long-term value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide number four, our global team continues to execute at a high level and delivered another quarter of strong performance, showcasing the benefits of our diverse, resilient portfolio. Organic revenue was up 11%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 24%. We delivered 30%+ organic leverage across the enterprise and in each segment, led by our commercial HVAC businesses in each region.\nOur residential HVAC business continued to normalize and was further impacted by a difficult comp versus the second quarter of last year when revenues were up 30%. Net, on a two-year stack, residential revenues were up mid-teens in Q2. Importantly, we're delivering strong results while increasing business reinvestments. We're accelerating high ROI projects in focused areas, including digital, electrification, and factory automation. These investments are flowing through our segment results, as well as through corporate expenses for enterprise-wide initiatives to drive innovation, growth, and productivity well into the future.\nBookings remained robust after reaching unprecedented levels in 2021, with nearly 30% bookings growth. In 2021, bookings exceeded revenue by approximately $2.7 billion, nearly doubling our backlog in a single year to $5.4 billion. During 2022, bookings grew more modestly, up 5%. However, the sharp increase in absolute bookings in 2021 translated 5% bookings growth in 2022 into another 27% increase in backlog. Net, 2021 and 2022 are both important drivers of our strong backlog position of $7 billion at the end of the second quarter, which is roughly two and a half times historical levels.\nWe've been encouraging investors to look at absolute booking levels and backlog, in addition to growth rates, to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our business. Further, when looking at growth rates for Trane Technologies, it's important to consider a three-year stack that includes 2021 for the reasons discussed. Commercial HVAC continues to be a standout across our segments globally. In the second quarter, commercial HVAC bookings were up nearly 40% in each region on a three-year stack, supporting revenue growth of high teens in both the Americas, EMEA, and 45% in Asia.\nAdditionally, our commercial HVAC book-to-bill ratios were effectively 100% or higher in each region. Our end markets continue to be healthy overall, and we believe we are well positioned for strong growth in 2023. While it's premature to dial in an outlook for 2024, continued high levels of demand, and our extremely strong backlog position, particularly across our commercial HVAC businesses globally, puts us in a strong position to drive growth in 2024 as well. We expect to enter 2024 with elevated backlog of more than $6 billion. To put that in perspective, backlog has historically represented approximately 20% of the next year's revenue.\nIt's also worth noting that $2 billion of our $7 billion in current backlog is for equipment to be delivered in 2024. This is approximately five times the level of backlog for the next fiscal year versus historical trends at the end of the second quarter. Our strong results through the first half, combined with healthy end markets, and backlog that remains two and a half times norms, positions us well to raise our full-year 2023 guidance. Chris will discuss in more detail later in our prepared remarks. Please go to slide number five.\nAs we've discussed, bookings and revenue growth were broad-based globally, with particular strength in our Commercial HVAC businesses in all regions. Enterprise and Americas bookings were down 5% and 8%, respectively, largely due to softness in our Americas Residential business, which was down approximately 20% in the quarter as that business continues to normalize. Excluding the impact of residential bookings decline, enterprise bookings were up 1%, and Americas bookings were down low single digits.\nIn our Americas segment, commercial HVAC bookings were down mid-single digits against high teens growth comp in the prior year. Absolute bookings remained robust, with growth of approximately 40% on a three-year stack. Commercial HVAC revenues were up high teens in the quarter, with strong growth in both equipment and services. Even with strong revenue growth, the book-to-bill ratio was approximately 100%. Commercial HVAC backlog remains highly elevated at three times historical levels. Residential HVAC revenues were down as expected as the business continues to normalize. Revenues were down low teens.\nHowever, it's important to note that the team delivered leading revenue growth of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. On a two-year stack, the business was up mid-teens. In our transport refrigeration business, we delivered strong bookings and revenue growth, up approximately 40% and 30%, respectively. Revenue strength was broad-based in North America, with the big three: truck, trailer, and APUs, up approximately 50%. In our EMEA segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered another strong quarter. Bookings were up mid-single digits on top of low teens growth comp in the prior year.\nRevenues were up high teens, with strength in both equipment and services, up mid-20s and high single digits, respectively. Our transport refrigeration business is executing well in a modestly down market. Expect the EMEA weighted average transport markets to be down low single digits to mid-single digits in 2023, and for our Thermo King business to outperform and to be relatively flat for the year. With revenue growth of mid-single digits in Q1 and revenues down low single digits in Q2, we're well positioned to hit this target for the full year.\nIn our Asia Pacific segment, the team delivered strong results, with bookings up mid-single digits versus bookings up mid-teens in the prior year. Revenues were very strong, up 41%. China results were robust, with bookings and revenues up 20% and 40%, respectively. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. We delivered strong revenue growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth again in the second quarter. Organic revenues were up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 24%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low teens and high single digits, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investments in innovation driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, and powerful free cash flow.\nPlease turn to slide number seven. We've discussed the key revenue dynamics for the second quarter, so I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments and have highlighted the key margin drivers on the right side of the page. In each of our regions, as the supply chain continues to improve, we're driving strong leverage on volume growth, along with strong price realization and improving productivity. Near-term, challenges continue in pockets of our business with associated costs, and we are managing these well across our segments as reflected in our results.\nAs an enterprise, we delivered about six points of volume and about five points of price in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations on both price and volume. Volume growth was robust in our commercial HVAC businesses, accompanied by strong organic leverage in excess of 30% in each region. Americas performance was led by strength in commercial HVAC and aided by robust growth in our Americas transport refrigeration business, more than offsetting continued normalization of our residential business.\nEMEA delivered strong incrementals and margins after accounting for approximately nine points of M&A growth in the quarter, which negatively impacted reported leverage given year-one integration costs. As we discussed previously, we've earmarked 70 basis points for incremental business reinvestment in 2023, which is about 30 basis points higher than normal to accelerate the timing of key projects. This is included in our guidance, and reflected in segment margins, and partially in corporate expenses each quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. Looking forward, we see continued strong underlying demand for sustainable solutions well into the future. We see the stacking effect of policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strengths as a leading climate innovator, as tailwinds that are either early to mid-earnings or future multi-year opportunities. The pace of these tailwinds has only accelerated in recent years, and with the realities of climate change all around us, it's likely we'll see this pace continue. The tailwinds impact all of our businesses, as 100% of our portfolio is focused on driving more sustainable solutions for our customers.\nIn our Americas segment, our overall outlook is relatively unchanged. We see commercial strength continuing to outweigh impacts from ongoing normalization of our residential business. We expect residential to continue to normalize through Q3, but to improve from Q2, and we expect the normalization process to be complete in 2023. Commercial faces tough comps in the second half of the year with less contribution from price, so we'd expect growth rates to remain strong, but moderate from the first half of 2023. There's no change to our transport refrigeration outlook overall.\nACT has modestly lowered their forecast for 2023 from flattish to a decline of low single digits, largely related to trucking OEM build constraints. We expect our Thermo King business in the Americas to outperform with low to mid-single digit growth for the year. One additional callout is related to the timing of our revenues in our Thermo King business. In the first half of the year, Thermo King delivered 20% growth, outpacing the North America transport markets, which were flat overall. A portion of that outgrowth was driven by timing of customer deliveries committed in the first half versus the second half of the year.\nAdditionally, Thermo King delivered extremely strong results in Q3 2022, up 60%. Given this difficult comp and the timing dynamics between the first half and the second half, we expect our Thermo King business to be down approximately 10% in the third quarter. In our EMEA segment, the second quarter was strong, and our outlook for the full year is also unchanged. Like the Americas, Commercial HVAC faces tough comps with less contribution from price in the second half of the year, so we would expect growth rates to moderate. Our Thermo King business in EMEA is unchanged.\nThe forecast for the overall market calls for low single-digit to mid-single-digit decline, and we expect our Thermo King business to be flattish. Turning to Asia Pacific, our outlook for the region is largely unchanged, with strength continuing in key verticals as highlighted. Our team delivered a better-than-expected second quarter against a relatively soft comp from the prior year given COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The strong Q2 results pulled in a modest amount of revenue from the third quarter based on timing of customer deliveries. Overall, the year is shaping up as expected, with a solid growth outlook.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. As Dave highlighted at the beginning of the call, we're midway through the year with strong results, near-record backlog, and good visibility into the balance of the year. All in, we're confident in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. We're raising our full-year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance range of 7% to 8, reflecting strong results in the first half and improving visibility into the balance of the year across the portfolio. Including M&A, reported revenues are expected to be up approximately 10%.\nWe're raising and tightening our EPS guidance to a range of $8.80 to 8.90, up from a range of $8.30 to 8.50, or up $0.45 at the midpoint. Our new adjusted EPS guidance indicates earnings growth of 20% to 21 in 2023. Importantly, we continue to expect to generate powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net earnings, or approximately $2 billion. We're raising our organic leverage guidance to 30%+, up from 25%+, as we expect the strength we've delivered in the first half of the year to continue in the second half.\nWe also believe it's constructive to give you some color around our expectations for the third quarter to assist with your modeling. We expect organic revenues of approximately 7% in the third quarter, with strong 30%+ organic leverage. We also expect approximately three points of M&A in the third and fourth quarters. We closed on two acquisitions in the second quarter, so our expected M&A contribution in the third and fourth quarters is a bit higher than it is for the first half and for the full year.\nPlease see slide 18 for additional information that may assist with your models. Please go to slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings in high ROI projects to further fuel innovation, growth, and productivity. Our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation.\nWhile it's been difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years, given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity has been improving as supply chains recover. This is reflected in our strong first-half results and our updated 2023 organic leverage target of 30%+. Please go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest return for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment.\nSecond, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023. Year to date, we've deployed $1.2 billion in cash, with $341 million to dividends, $535 million to M&A, and $300 million to share repurchases.\nWe have $2.9 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have deployed $535 million year to date for bolt-on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments. During Q2, we acquired a leading industrial process cooling technology company in EMEA and a precision temperature control cooling company in the life sciences vertical in the Americas. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023.\nOur strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 14. Today, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the transport refrigeration markets. As we know, this is a topic of interest for investors. The key takeaway is that while there has been a modest movement in the ACT North America forecast from flattish to down low single digits for 2023, we're not seeing material changes that would impact our full-year outlook given our strong backlog and bookings expectations. Overall, we expect our Thermo King business in the Americas to be up low to mid-single digits in 2023, which reflects several points of market outgrowth.\nOur EMEA Thermo King outlook is also unchanged. The overall EMEA transport refrigeration market is expected to be down low to mid-single digits. We expect to outperform end markets and to be roughly flat for 2023. In both segments, we are on pace to achieve these targets. Please go to slide number 15. ACT continues to provide long-term forecasts for refrigerated trailers, and they are projecting strong demand through 2028 after low single-digit dips in 2023 and 2024.\nThe data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time now that this is a strong mid-40,000-unit market, ± a few percentage points. Please go to slide number 16. In summary, we are positioned to outperform over the long term. We are proud to have recently been recognized by Fast Company as one of the best workplaces for innovators, and also certified as a great place to work for the third consecutive year. It's our culture and our people that fuel our innovation and fulfill our purpose each and every day.\nOur strong second-quarter performance, resilient portfolio, and tremendous backlog gives us confidence in, again, raising our full-year revenues and EPS guidance, and reaffirming our full-year free cash flow conversion guidance. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team, and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you doing? Good morning.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? Dave and Chris, you delivered 30% leverage in Q2 and are expecting 30% for the year, which obviously is above your usual 25%+ guide. Is the biggest reason that you're getting, is it that you're getting more than 20 to 30 basis points of price versus cost in the quarter and for the year? You mentioned higher-than-usual investments this year, as well as accelerating productivity. Could 30% really be the new 25% potentially as you go into 2024 over the longer term in terms of incremental margin?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt is, Chris. Thanks for the question. No, look, we're proud where we've delivered 30% organic leverage through the first half of the year, and it's giving us a lot of confidence to be 30% or greater in 2023. Look, we're leveraging all parts of the P&L. Price cost is coming in better than expected. We typically target 20 to 30 basis points of price cost spread. We're going to do better than that this year. We are seeing a recovery of the supply chain. It is driving improved productivity, less inefficiencies in our plants. With that higher volume growth and the fewer inefficiencies, we're really getting some nice, strong incrementals.\nWhat we're really seeing is a dovetail here between price-cost contribution, which will normalize in the second half of the year. We're seeing productivity improving with that improved supply chain. Ultimately, like I said, driving those higher volumes. We're continuing to invest incrementally. We're still targeting 60 to 70 basis points of incremental investment, called 30 to 40 basis points above normal. We really like that formula. Really, it's all parts of the P&L that are working and giving us confidence on the 30%+, Andy, for this year. On your question, longer term, we do like the model of 25%+ organic leverage into the future.\nWe like that optionality that it gives us to keep reinvesting into the business. As we go into each and every year, we'll kind of call it as we see it at that time. We do like that long-term target.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nWell, I tried, Chris. Thanks for that. Dave, can you give us more color into how you're thinking about commercial HVAC markets in the Americas? You talked about a good three-year stack. We know there are tough comps. Maybe you could give us your thoughts on book to bill going forward there. Are there any markets that you would term as slowing? You kept the $6 billion overall minimum backlog for the company. The two quarters behind you, would you say the chances are higher that you'd end the year closer to seven than six? Any thoughts around that minimum?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. That's a long question, Andy. I'll try to remember it all. As we said, I think it's going to be $6 billion, north of $6 billion for the year. I'll start there. Look, I'm proud of what the team's been able to deliver. If you look at the revenue growth for commercial HVAC in the second quarter, it was high teens. Despite that high revenue growth, our book-to-bill was approximately 100%. You could just see the absolute bookings numbers are just very, very strong. If you look at where the strength is coming from, it's really broad-based across several verticals.\nThink of data centers, high tech, healthcare, ESSER funding in the education vertical, all really driving a lot of growth for us in our commercial HVAC business. That team continues to execute at a very, very high level. Now, we're starting to see some of the mega projects really come in. Our team is just doing a great job of triaging how we call on those customers. This is where a direct sales force, Andy, I know you and I have talked about this before, is really a competitive advantage, and it's a global direct sales force. We recently were working with a customer in Texas on a semiconductor plant.\nJust to give you some of the complexity, these are complex projects, but here's a project where the owner was located in South Korea, the engineer was located in Portland, Oregon, the general contractor was also out of South Korea, and the mechanical was located in Texas. Here, our team triages, has direct contact with all of those influencers, and really allows us to create a differentiated value proposition for the customer. Short answer is we continue to see lots of nice growth.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVery helpful, Dave. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. It sounds like slightly better, perhaps, commercial HVAC sales outlook unchanged in transport largely, and then resi HVAC, maybe slightly worse. I just wanted to sort of ask you on that last piece. Is the right way to think about that, that you had sort of volumes down, high teens in the second quarter, that narrows in Q3, and then you're sort of flat to modestly down in the fourth quarter? Is that the way to think about that resi market? Any thoughts on the sort of inventory levels sitting out there for you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Julian, how are you doing? This is Dave. I'll start. Look, I think I'll go back to a year ago, okay? In the second quarter of 2022, our revenue growth in the resi business was 30%. I don't remember the exact market number, but I believe it was up in the teens. We had a lot of growth there in the second quarter. Obviously, the second quarter of this year, we're down in the mid-teens. If you look at it on a two-year comp, you'd say we're still up in the mid-teens. As far as inventory goes in the channel, we're normalizing in 2023 in our resi business, and we think that normalization process is going to continue in the back half of the year.\nWe're calling residential to be down high single digits on a unit basis for the year. We think the third quarter will be better than the second quarter, but there's still going to be some normalization that has to occur in that business. If you look a little bit forward into 2024, we think the normalization process, at least from an inventory standpoint, will be behind us in 2023. A little early to call what 2024 will be. However, we do expect some tailwinds coming in from policy, specifically around IRA.\nCan't size that yet because the rules are still a little unclear on IRA, but we do believe it will be a tailwind for our businesses in both the residential and in commercial. Chris, anything you want to add?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGoing back to Q2, Q3 last year, I think we felt like we led in price over 2021 and 2022. That is a part of the reason of the tough comp. To Dave's guidance on the full year, revenues down mid-single digits, units down high singles. We've built into our guide, plus or minus, revenues down mid-singles. We feel like that's part of our guidance that we've updated here on top-line revenue growth and earnings per share.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you. My second question on the backlog outlook, maybe to ask it a slightly different way from the prior question, pre-COVID, I think the backlog to sales coverage was 20%. Last 18 months, it's run at sort of 40%+. Is the broad idea here that that coverage shrinks slowly but surely, but ends up at a place well above where you were pre-COVID? Is that how we should sort of think about the backlog? Your commercial HVAC orders, therefore, don't see a big drop from current levels.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian, Chris, I'll start. I think about the backlog at the end of December to now, at the end of the second quarter, backlog's up about $100 million, but you're seeing residential execute through its normalization, Thermo King executing through its backlog, and actually, commercial HVAC is up from even six months ago. We just continue to see very strong strength there. Our view is we're going to be greater than $6 billion going into the end of 2023. It's going to set us up very well for healthy revenue growth in 2024. I think it'll continue to be a high-grade problem we're going to have for a little bit of time to come.\nThe backlog will normalize over time. We're just not seeing very much of that happening this year. In Dave's comments, $2 billion of the current backlog here at the end of the second quarter is already built for 2024. That's five times the normal level we'd have here at the end of the second quarter. We're getting a lot of visibility into next year already. As you mentioned, a normal percentage of the next 12 months of revenue and backlog is 20%. Dave won't let me commit to $30 billion of revenue next year if we end the year at $6 billion of backlog. It will normalize to your point, Julian. It's just going to take some time.\nWe're still seeing some very strong strength in commercial HVAC right now.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh. How you doing?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, thanks. Dave, you mentioned ESSER and IRA a couple of times. IRA specifically having a hard time quantifying just yet. Maybe thinking about how those two maybe intersect and then diverge. Where are we in sort of the total ESSER spending, whether it's orders or shipments? Do you feel like IRA will be similar size, larger, smaller? Any way you can kind of dimensionalize those two things as we're maybe maturing in one and entering the other?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We'll start with ESSER. I think if you look at it from a revenue standpoint, I'd say it's middle innings. If you look at it from an order standpoint, it's obviously a little bit ahead of that because we have orders in our backlog for this. Our team's just done a great job there, working with the school systems across the country and really helping them increase the ability for them to have a safe environment for the children that are learning there. It really started—I think you heard me say this before—it started when we were doing indoor air qualities, we created roadmaps, and we're really executing to that.\nRevenue standpoint, think of it mid-single digits. IRA, it's all in front of us, okay? It's going to be a 2024 tailwind. Very difficult to size right now because each state may have a different set of standards. We're trying to understand all those different standards now. It will be a tailwind. We're just trying to size it. With the breadth of our portfolio, regardless of how the final rules are written, we'll have a product that will be part of a solution for a customer. I know we tend to want to think of IRA in the residential space, and it will certainly be a tailwind there. It's also going to be a tailwind for our commercial business.\nWe're working both fronts of it. Stay tuned. As we learn more, we'll tell others.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Maybe just on the backlog, if I recall correctly, you guys don't count service in that reported backlog number. If that's correct, maybe give us some context for how service backlogs look if you had to parse them out that way, and how much kind of extra visibility you have on that front.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're correct. It doesn't provide any service. We don't include that in our backlog. Difficult to say. Service, first of all, our service business is a great business, okay? It was up again, high single digits in the second quarter. Chris, I think we're now—I think I could say six years now where we have compound annual growth rate of high single digits across the globe, okay? This is a very strong business, and it's key to our strategy and really allows us to be tethered to our customers for the life of our products.\nIt's difficult to ascertain a backlog because if you start thinking of multi-year service agreements, it would just really be difficult to say if it's a three-year service agreement. A lot of times, we like to add things to service agreements, so it'd be hard to quantify that number.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood. Appreciate the detail. That's all, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. Obviously, a lot of focus on orders. With that, I wanted to follow up on the prior commentary around the US mega projects that we're seeing. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about how these projects flow into orders for Trane and then ultimately revenue for Trane, just to kind of get a sense for what that lag could be? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Chris, good question. We have a very detailed process that is part of our operating system that we follow. We start all the way in the planning phase, then move to permitting, then go to engineering, then go to groundbreaking and site prep, then through construction. It's a very detailed approach you need to follow. The earlier you're involved, the more value you're going to create for the customer. As far as the timing on these, it depends on the type of project, okay? If it's a semiconductor plant, that process could take three and a half to four years from planning all the way through completion.\nThink about HVAC equipment probably being installed and operating maybe nine to 12 months before operation of the facility. You could start to back that up as to when you'd start to see orders. It's a bit different on a battery plant, a little bit shorter duration. Again, it's really being involved early in the planning phase and then all through the process. These are very complex projects, so you often have influencers in different parts of the globe that you need to have relationships with and be able to call on.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I appreciate that. If I could follow up on data center, another big focus in the market right now. I mean, it's a vertical that the company has always done well in. Can you maybe talk about how activity is trending here? Is the business seeing any impact from AI investment into data centers? Is that still on the horizon? Any color outlook there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, it is a vertical that we've been strong in for a long time, okay? The answer on AI and the new GPU chip that's now going to be used with AR, predominantly with AI, that's a graphics processing unit. These units produce a lot more heat. Think of a conventional CPU or central processing unit versus a GPU, graphics processing unit. The graphics processing unit throws off about three times the amount of heat versus what we've seen in the past. If you take that and you think about a data center, the cooling loads within data centers are going to have to change.\nWe're working with a lot of data center customers because we have a lot of really neat solutions around these high-heat applications. It's definitely going to have an impact on the data centers of tomorrow, how they're being constructed, how they're being planned. I would tell you that our teams are working very closely with our customers and developing really creative solutions.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. Good morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Chris, I know that you don't want to give, I guess, maybe too many details on just price cost, but following up on Andy's question from earlier, I'm just curious, the benefit that you got in Q2, are you expecting that benefit to be fairly consistent through the remainder of the year, or is it kind of like the biggest benefit you'll see in 2023? As you kind of think about the transformational cost out beyond this year, I'm just curious what's in store beyond 2023.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Joe. We did see price of around 5 points in the second quarter. We do expect that to moderate into the second half of the year. If I think about Q3 and Q4 of 2022, we delivered over 10 points of price in the second half of last year. We do expect that to moderate. As I think about the full year, our 8% organic revenue growth guide, we still see a bias towards a little bit more volume growth and price. That price contribution will moderate, still be above the normal levels, let's say, of price pre-pandemic and pre-disinflation. This is where that dovetail with productivity, I think, is another way for us to fully leverage the P&L.\nAs the supply chain continues to get better, we had 6 points of volume growth in the quarter, and we're expecting strong volumes in the second half. We're seeing better productivity in the plants. To your second question, there's a lot of lost productivity for us to recapture over the last couple of years with these supply chain constraints.\nThat, I think, is the next layer of opportunity for the company as we're, A, well on track to deliver the $300 million of savings from transformation, and then, B, we're always looking to make improvements in our business, leverage our business operating system to drive efficiencies, and offset other inflation with productivity. There's a productivity recapture here that I think is a tailwind for the company and gives us confidence that a 25% or greater organic leverage target is something we can achieve over time.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. It's great to hear, Chris. Maybe one quick follow-up for Dave. I'm curious, this is a much broader question around the labor markets and then kind of the tightness we've seen over the last couple of years. I'm just curious, how is that kind of impacting some of the projects actually getting completed and whether it's actually elongating the timelines of some of these projects? I know that you mentioned earlier that we're probably halfway through the ESSER funding coming through in the P&L. I'm just curious, what are you seeing in terms of construction projects and labor tightness today?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll answer the question two ways, Joe. One is on the commercial side, so construction projects, we've seen some delays, but nothing that I would call—I think those have improved from what we've seen in the past. I wouldn't say that's something that we're seeing some projects push, but not a lot. That's not a major problem. I think from an internal source of our direct labor, we've done a lot of work with developing programs to really—apprenticeship programs—to really grow talent and to give opportunities to people to learn new skills.\nWe've done a lot with tuition advancement programs so that we could deliver at a grassroots level the talent not only for today, but also for the future. We've had a lot of success with that. I was out in La Crosse, Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago, and it was just refreshing to see the apprenticeship labs we have out there, teaching individuals that were not experts in welding become experts in welding. It's a great job, a great living that these individuals can have with Trane Technologies, and there's great advancement. Overall, we're okay.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSounds good. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you doing?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nNot too bad. Can you just give the split between commercial and applied in that equipment number?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSales number or bookings, either one?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. In the Americas, our revenue was very strong in equipment. It was up over 30%. Applied was a bit stronger than unitary, but both were strong.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Just on resi, the guidance this year—I think your units are down low double so far, first half, maybe, something like that. It's hard to tell how much price you're getting there. You're guiding for, I guess, for the year, a high single-digit decline. Is that just the comps in the second half, and then maybe just some color on what you guys are seeing so far with the hot weather here in July?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Steve, it's a bit of all of that. I think sequential improvement we're expecting from Q2 to Q3. The delayed start to the cooling season, that's fully in force at this point. We see that sequential improvement into the second half. The comps get a little bit easier as you go into the second half of the year. As Dave mentioned, 30% growth in Q2 a year ago. It was mid-teens growth in Q3, and then flattish in Q4. We just see a little bit easier comps in the second half of the year for resi than where they were in the first half of 2022.\nI have a lot of confidence that we think we're calling the units down, high single digits for the year, revenues down probably around mid-singles. Again, plus or minus, we've got that in our guide for the full-year outlook.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nIs there any difference between the sell-in and sell-through, your independent distribution versus your captive in the quarter?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, a bit. Our revenue was down in the mid-teens. Our sell-through was down in the mid-single digits. The inventory adjustment happened in the second quarter, Steve. We just think more of it will happen in the third quarter as well.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYep, makes some sense. All right, thanks, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Steve, one more thing on price. I think we were trying to dial in price on the first half. We're not getting the strong levels of price as you may think we're getting in the first half. It is less than 5% for the first half, and it's going to get lower in the second half for resi. That's just really a strong, very strong comp against where we led with price in 2021 and 2022. We're just seeing that normalize here in the business. Hopefully that helps clarify a couple of things.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, great, thanks.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure thing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, all.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you doing?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nI'm doing really well. Thanks. Hope you are too. Hey, Dave, I wonder if you could just give us your thoughts on the refrigerant transition in 2025 for resi and whether that does, in fact, cause any sort of pre-buy or channel distortions in 2024.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I mean, there is a refrigerant change that will happen in 2025, moving away from 410. Look, we're ready for it. I'll start with the engineering side of it. We're ready for it. We've worked with next-generation refrigerants for a while, so this is right up our alley, and the team's done a great job preparing us. We're also preparing our manufacturing locations as we speak to be ready for it. The new refrigerant is classified as slightly flammable, so you have different procedures as to how you handle the refrigerant. We'll be ready for it. We're not concerned about that.\nAs far as a pre-buy goes, Jeff, the product's going to be more expensive, yes, because it's a, what they call a 2L refrigerant, slightly flammable. You will have additional sensors on the equipment, so the cost will be higher. There's also going to be a limit on the sell-through. If you were trying to create a pre-buy, you would have to sell through that inventory. The way it's written right now is within 12 months, or it'd be stranded inventory. I do not anticipate that we're going to see a large pre-buy at this time. We'll see how it plays out.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat, understand. It looks and feels like M&A is picking up a little bit, select kind of technology, bolt-ons, and the like. Is that the playbook going forward? Do you see the prospect for larger things? Are there larger things in the pipeline, whether or not they may be actionable or not?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, as you could imagine, being a global HVAC player, we get to see a lot of different opportunities. We like these technology acquisitions. We've been very successful with them. We acquired MTA, great industrial process cooling technology. We'll be able to scale that. It's predominantly in Europe. We'll be able to scale it in our channels. We also acquired Helmer in the second quarter. Think of that in the life science space. Think about it as the storage capability, but also in the processing capability. Again, a nice acquisition that we'll be able to scale with our channels. We like this technology.\nWe've been very good at taking these technology companies with great products and bolting them onto our operations. With our strong channel, we've been able to create a lot of value for our shareholders.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I want to go back to margins. Hi, David. I want to go back to margins, obviously, the improving organic incrementals. I'm hearing better productivity at the factory. Obviously, price cost is a nice tailwind. I'm just curious, how do margins and backlog look generally compared to what we're converting now? Do we have better backlog margins to come through over the next year or so? On the investment spending, I think we had a slight back-end loading on the investment spending this year. Is there anything on the timeline of investment spending we need to factor into our models?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "I think, Chris, I'll start. We've been happy with the margins and backlog. Obviously, our backlog is more focused on equipment than it is service, but we're happy with the margins and the backlog. It gives us confidence on the 30%+ leverage for the year. We're just starting to build some backlog for 2024, so we'll comment more on that as we get to guiding for 2024. The team's just done an outstanding job for several years now, making sure that we're embedding inflation and expectations around that, and making sure that we're getting price.\nIt's a lot easier, as Dave reminds me all the time, it's a lot easier to get price when you get innovative products out there and you're talking to the customer about an improved solution from what they previously have. All that is reflected in our higher organic leverage guide for the year, and we'll kind of update as we go through the end of this year, getting ready for 2024. On the investments, yeah, we're still targeting, call it 70 basis points of incremental investment.\nThink of this as investments in our electrification portfolio across our product lines, electrifying the portfolio, investments in the digital strategy, the connectedness back to customers, the previous question on AI. We have over 36,000 connected buildings, over 1 million pieces of connected assets. This is an area that we're continuing to invest in, and we're really pleased with that progress in the investments so far this year. A third area of investments for us would be around automation and investing in our own factories. This is starting to see some early results with better productivity as well.\nThe pipeline is strong on the investments. We're continuing to make sure we can accelerate them where we can. It just gives us a lot of encouragement. It's going to drive results in the future.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, that's all baked into our guide, Nigel. If you look at the midpoint of our EPS guide for the year, we'll be above 20% EPS growth for the third year in a row. I mean, I'm super proud of what the team's been able to accomplish there. It's the flywheel of innovation. It's the flywheel around how we operate our business operating system. I always tell people it's a system of things that makes Trane Technologies a great company. Hopefully, investors see how we're executing through that system of things.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo question. The 70 basis points, I think you mentioned in Q1 that that was a bit lighter than 70 basis points. I just wanted to see if maybe there was anything on timing as well. My follow-up question is maybe a bit off-piste, but most of your industrial peers have gone to cash EPS. I think you're carrying about $150 million of intangibles right now. I think it's about $0.50 per share or thereabouts. It's a chunk of change, for sure. Have you considered maybe moving to cash EPS, especially as you're doing these bolt-ons, which do tend to carry a lot more fair amount of intangibles? Have you considered that move?\nIf not, would you consider that if you were to do more deals?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNigel, appreciate the suggestion. We'll look into it. We like the simple methodology of looking at just net earnings and how much free cash flow are we driving off of that. When I think about our conversion, the last three years, the average free cash flow conversion in earnings for us is 110%. We're targeting this year equal to or greater than 100% on conversion. We do look at that metric. When it comes to our return on invested capital, we'll look at cash flow return on invested capital as another metric. I think it takes out the noise a bit of some of the accounting conventions that you have to manage through.\nUltimately, on an ex-intangible basis, let's look at the cash returns of those investments. We'll start that with an acquisition, really, year one, year two, year three, and evaluate its accretiveness over a period of time. We like the ability to buy the third year of an acquisition, have accretive EPS growth, drive accretive cash flow return on invested capital. I would say, while very modest this year, even the acquisitions we just made this year will have a very modest impact on EPS already in year one. I think that's a bit of the metric, but appreciate the insight. We'll certainly give that some thought.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nFair enough. Cash is king. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Dean.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, can we put the spotlight on China for a moment here? It was really a standout. Whereas a lot of the other industrials have struggled in terms of COVID reopening and so forth, how much of that was a catch-up? Just kind of give us perspective on what the cadence of orders are, and what you're expecting in the second half.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we did have an easy comp in the second quarter in Asia Pacific, specifically in China because of COVID lockdowns. Think about, I think it was like $60 million that pushed out of the second quarter into the back half of the year. Even with that, we had very strong results in China. If you look specifically in China, the verticals that are strong, we're strong in. Think of the high-tech verticals, semiconductors, data centers, healthcare. Those are all, with the direct sales force, again, we're very strong in those verticals. The team there has just executed at a very high level.\nWe have a very strong team in Asia Pacific, and we continue to do very, very well in that region of the world.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's great. Data centers come up multiple times. AI has come up multiple times. We get that. In your answer to Chris's question about the implications of AI and the whole 3x heat factor with the new chips, the legacy cooling for data centers will still be in demand, but more investment is happening on the liquid cooling side. Maybe you teased us a bit with, say, you've got some other projects that you're working on, so maybe there's some liquid cooling opportunities there. How do you see, as a legacy air cooling business, how do you see the rise of liquid cooling? Is this a threat? Is this a business that you need to get into?\nJust share us what you think the roadmap is.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat question, Dean. You obviously did your homework in this space. We made an equity investment in a company called LiquidStack at the end of the first quarter, and they specialize in emerging cooling. Think about emerging cooling as you're actually putting the rack into what they call a dielectric fluid. All that means is it doesn't conduct electricity. These are very efficient systems. We have our scientists working with LiquidStack scientists, and we actually have some data center customers that are involved in this as well as we really triage this opportunity. Early days, this has a lot of promise, and we're excited about it.\nI think when you get into these high-heat applications, this is where a new technology will be developed. We're going to keep working it. We're not there yet, but we think it has a lot of opportunities for the future.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, we agree. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Nice question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andrew. How are you doing?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI'm doing well. Just a question trying to size another opportunity. Obviously, these big mega projects, EVs and semiconductors, what's the right way of sizing it per project as a percent of sales? I mean, I've heard a number, I think, 100,000-ton chiller per semi-plant. You guys brought up, I take it, at San Francisco, Texas. Is that sort of the right size of thinking per facility? Just thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI mean, it's a good question, Andrew. The short answer is it depends. You have some fab plants that are extensions. You have other fab plants that are new. The EV battery plant could be really all over the map as far as the size that they'll be putting in. I hate to give out a number because averages will always, I know you're trying to size the total opportunity. I would just tell you it's large, and it's large on both the chilled water side as well as on the air handling side. If you think about it as an applied system, this is a large opportunity. It will be a tailwind for our business into the future.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nJust maybe shifting a little bit to light commercial, can we just talk about what has been driving the strength in light commercial, and anything that sort of concerns you about maybe channel inventory in light commercial or just comms getting tough? Or frankly, you talked about not seeing any impact from IRA into 2024, if that just trumps everything and we should just take a longer-term view. Just more color on light commercial unitary thinking.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI don't think there's anything I would call out. I think there was an efficiency change. You knew about that. Certainly, there could have been some pent-up demand. It's not a product that we have a lot of inventory on. Some of it goes through our IWDs on the very light side, but that's not where, when we talk about our residential business, we talk about normalizing, that's not where the normalization has to occur. It's been strong. It's been strong for a while. Obviously, we have a very competitive portfolio there with some really neat innovations.\nI think I told you when we were together that we took the opportunity when we had the efficiency change to really refresh the portfolio. Now, all of our light unitary product can be offered in what we call a dual fuel option. Think of it as a heat pump that could also operate with a fossil fuel based on what ambient temperatures are in a particular region at a particular time. Very efficient customers. We're super excited about the opportunities there.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGotcha. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChairperson and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andrew. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Zac Nagle for closing comments.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining in today's call. Thanks for your interest and time spent with Trane Technologies. We'll be at a variety of investor events in the fall, and we hope to see many of you there. We'll chat soon. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

We have reduced our customers' carbon emissions by 93 million metric tons since 2019, towards our goal of reducing emissions by 1 gigaton or 1 billion metric tons by 2030. These bold ambitions drive our relentless focus on innovation, and our innovation creates tremendous demand for our sustainable solutions. This enables us to deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins, and powerful free cash flow. The end result is long-term value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet.\nMoving to slide number four, our global team continues to execute at a high level and delivered another quarter of strong performance, showcasing the power of our diverse, resilient portfolio. Organic revenue was up 9%, Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points, and Adjusted EPS grew 26%. Absolute bookings levels continue to be extremely strong, as evidenced by our book-to-bill ratio of 117% in the first quarter. We added $400 million to our backlog, driving record backlog of $6.9 billion at year-end 2022 up to $7.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.\nDemand continues to be particularly strong in our long-cycle commercial HVAC businesses, where global commercial HVAC bookings were up more than 35% on a two-year stack, and Americas commercial HVAC bookings were up nearly 40% on a two-year stack. We've been encouraging investors to look at absolute booking levels and backlog, in addition to growth rates, to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our business. Q1 is a good example of why that is important.\nOur enterprise book-to-bill of 117% was led by Commercial HVAC in all regions, and demonstrates ongoing exceptional levels of demand for our innovative products and services, and continued backlog build. These strong results position us well for continued profitable growth in 2023 and 2024, with improving visibility. Our backlog of $7.3 billion is more than two and a half times historical norms. Further, we expect backlog to remain elevated throughout 2023, and anticipate entering 2024 with backlog in excess of $6 billion.\nTo be clear, $6 billion in backlog is a scenario we believe represents the floor. The intent is to accomplish two goals. First, give investors a high degree of confidence we will meet or exceed the floor scenario. The second is to give investors a high degree of confidence that the floor scenario would put us in a very strong position entering 2024, with backlog as a percentage of forward revenues significantly higher than historical norms. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and financial position continue to provide us with excellent capital allocation optionality.\nYear to date, we've deployed $720 million to dividends, share repurchases, and M&A, and we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in 2023. On the M&A front, we acquired a leading industrial process cooling technology Company in EMEA, and committed to acquire a precision temperature control cooling company in the life science vertical in the Americas. Overall, the first quarter played out essentially as expected and gives us confidence in raising our full-year guidance for revenue and EPS growth.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow to be equal to or better than 100% of Adjusted net earnings. Chris will discuss our guidance in more detail later in the presentation. Please go to slide number five. Demand for our innovative products and services continued to be broad-based across our segments, highlighting the strength of our global portfolio. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was not only strong at the enterprise level, but exceeded 115% in each segment as well, contributing to elevated backlog across the portfolio. Revenues were also robust in each segment, with particular strength across our commercial HVAC businesses.\nIn the Americas, our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 115%, led by commercial HVAC. The commercial HVAC team delivered standout results with strong absolute bookings that exceeded mid-teens revenue growth. Revenue growth was strong in both equipment and services, up high teens and low teens, respectively. Our Americas residential business performed largely in line with our expectations at this early stage in the year. Bookings and revenue continued to normalize as we approached the cooling season, and distributors managed their inventory positions.\nStill, our book-to-bill was roughly flat in the quarter.Sell-through revenues across our channel and our IWDs were flat year-over-year. Our Americas transport refrigeration business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter, with mid-single-digit revenue growth. We expect this business to outperform the end markets, which are expected to be flat for the year. It's also worth noting that we expect quarterly bookings for both Americas and EMEA transport to be lumpy throughout the year, the timing of order books, customer order patterns, and elevated backlogs. In our EMEA segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered another standout quarter.\nBookings were robust, and revenues were up more than 25%, with strength in both equipment and services, up nearly 40% and high single digits, respectively. Our transport refrigeration business also had a very strong quarter with revenues up mid-single digits. We expect this business to outperform the EMEA transport refrigeration markets, which are expected to be down low single digits to mid-single digits for the year. In our Asia-Pacific segment, the team also delivered strong results with revenues up high single digits, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region.\nCommercial HVAC was again a standout with low teens revenue growth, led by services, which was up nearly 25%. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. This slide does a nice job highlighting our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenues were up 9%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points, and Adjusted EPS was up 26%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single digits and low teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investment and innovation driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth.\nPlease turn to slide number seven. We've discussed the key revenue dynamics for the first quarter, so I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments, and have highlighted the key margin drivers on the right side of the page. In each of our regions, strong price realization, volume growth, and productivity combined to more than offset continued supply chain challenges and persistent inflation in the quarter. As we've highlighted previously, the supply chain is slowly improving, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2023.\nAs an enterprise, we delivered about 6.5 points of price and about 2.5 points of volume in the quarter, which was largely in line with our expectations. We delivered strong volume growth in our commercial HVAC businesses in each region, accompanied by strong leverage, which was partially offset by lower volumes in our residential business as those markets continue to normalize. As we discussed previously, we've earmarked approximately 30 basis points for incremental business reinvestment to accelerate the timing of key projects.\nThis is above our average run rate of approximately 40 basis points annually, for a total of approximately 70 basis points in 2023. While investment spending was less than 70 basis points in the first quarter, it was in line with our expectations based on the timing of projects. We expect to ramp up to 70 basis points in the second quarter, and there is no change to our full-year guidance of approximately 70 basis points. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. We presented this slide on our fourth quarter earnings call to help provide color on our key markets. Overall, we had a very strong first quarter, as expected, and our positive outlook for our segments and our end markets is largely unchanged. We see strong core demand for our sustainability-focused solutions continuing. We see the stacking effect of supportive policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strengths as a leading climate innovator, as tailwinds for either early to mid-innings or future multi-year opportunities.\nWe see the effect of tight supply chains slowly but steadily improving, and we see strong execution of our business operating system and unprecedented backlog supporting resiliency and improving visibility into 2023 and 2024. In our Americas segment, our overall outlook is relatively balanced between commercial and residential. We see our residential business continuing to normalize through Q2. Our bias on our prior revenue estimates of the business being ± low single digits for the year is now towards the lower end of that range or flat to down low single digits.\nWhile this may present a modest headwind to the second quarter, we see strength in our commercial HVAC business more than offsetting this on the full year. Our transport refrigeration business performed as planned in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to outperform the market for the year. In our EMEA segment, the first quarter was strong and in line with our expectations for both businesses, and our outlook for the year is unchanged. Likewise, for our Asia-Pacific segment, Q1 performance was strong, and our outlook for the full year is unchanged. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. We're off to a strong start to the year, and we continue to see slow but steady improvement in our supply chain. Additionally, bookings and backlog continue at high levels, providing us with improving visibility into future revenues. All in, we're confident in raising the low end of our full-year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. We're raising our full-year organic revenue growth guidance to between 7% and 8%, up from our prior guidance of 6% to 8%, reflecting strong results in the first quarter and improving visibility on the year.\nWe're raising our Adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.30 to $8.50, up from $8.20 to $8.50. We're also expecting to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than net earnings. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged, with a few modest exceptions, mainly one additional point of M&A and associated impacts: higher interest expense related to debt refinancing in the first quarter, and expected pension expense in 2023. Please see page 18 of the presentation for additional details related to guidance to assist you with your models.\nAs we've highlighted before, we pay close attention to our investment peer group, and target top quartile revenue growth, EPS growth, and free cash flow conversion as part of our annual planning process, and we monitor our progress throughout the year. We believe our full-year guidance places us in the top quartile of the peer group on these metrics for 2023. In addition to our full-year guidance, we believe it may be useful to provide a high-level construct regarding how to think about Q2 and the cadence of earnings.\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit range, which reflects a step down in pricing sequentially, given very high levels of pricing realized in 2022. It also reflects continued normalization and inventory optimization across our residential distribution channels, as Dave referenced earlier. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.50 and $2.55, which includes approximately 30 basis points of incremental investment spend in the second quarter versus the first quarter, as I discussed earlier.\nThis EPS range is also consistent with our three-year average for second quarter earnings as a percentage of full-year earnings, which is approximately 30% at our full-year EPS guidance midpoint of $8.40. Please go to slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023, including an incremental $60 million in 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings in high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio.\nOur continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been extremely difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years, given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity has been improving as supply chains slowly recover and is contributing to our 25%+ organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders.\nFirst, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023.\nYear to date through May, we've deployed $720 million in cash, with $170 million to dividends, $250 million to M&A, and $300 million to share repurchases. We have significant dry powder, with $2.9 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have committed or deployed approximately $500 million year to date to bolt on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments.\nTwo of which Dave mentioned earlier, including a leading industrial process cooling technology business that was closed on 2 May 2023 and will complement our portfolio and our EMEA commercial HVAC business. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 14. The key takeaway for our Thermo King business is that the transport refrigeration market forecasts for both North America and EMEA remain unchanged, and we expect to outperform each market in 2023. Our performance through the first quarter is on track to meet these expectations. The slide shows key data points on the markets and on Thermo King specifically to provide additional transparency and reference information. Please turn to slide number 15. ACT has updated their long-term forecast for refrigerated trailers, and they are projecting strong demand through 2028.\nThe data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time now that this is a strong mid-40,000-unit market, ± a few percentage points. One key takeaway is that ACT has increased their 2024 forecast to 42,000 units, up from 40,000 units, which represents a 7% decline versus an 11% decline. In 2025, ACT forecasts the market to increase 7% and return to 45,000 units and to continue growing low single digits through 2028. Both our Americas and EMEA Thermo King businesses are poised to continue to outperform their end markets through leading innovation and strong execution. We believe this is a GDP-plus-plus business for us over the long term.\nPlease turn to slide number 16. In summary, we are positioned to outperform over the long term. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify, driving increased demand for innovative products and services. We are delivering leading technology and innovation to address these trends and accelerate the world's progress, underpinned by our engaging, uplifting culture. Our strong first quarter performance, diverse and resilient portfolio, and unprecedented backlog give us confidence in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance, and reaffirming our full-year free cash flow conversion guidance.\nWe believe we have the right strategy, the best teams, and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHi. Good morning, Dave, Chris, Zach, and everybody else who's in the room.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Scott. How are you?\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm good. Thank you. I'm getting a little beat up by earnings here, but we're near the end.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYou guys always give a lot of great detail and answer a lot of the questions, which is helpful. I haven't really heard you talk about mega projects specifically. When I think about kind of these giant semi-fabs and the EV facilities and everything that is on the list that folks are talking about, is this stuff starting to move into your backlogs? Are people starting to spec out the HVAC needs in those facilities? If so, I'm just kind of guessing these are super complicated. I have to imagine a semi-fab requires some pretty incredible engineering to get the cooling right, and perhaps you guys have an advantage in that regard. I'll just open it up to that.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat question, Scott. The short answer is, look, this high-tech industrial vertical, as we call it, we have a lot of strength in that vertical, and we have for a number of years. Yeah, we are starting to see early stages of some big orders coming in, specifically on the fab plant side of things. Again, I think the CHIPS and Science Act is really in front of us. Once that really starts to happen, you're going to see even greater closing of some of these big projects. I think a lot of it's in front of us. We are seeing some. We're also seeing some of it on the EV battery plants.\nThat's certainly been a nice—again, we classify this all as this high-tech industrial vertical, but it's certainly been a strength to us. You're right. These are sophisticated operations that require kind of detailed engineering. Not everyone is as cookie-cutter as you might think. There's always unique things, and our expertise in this vertical really allows us to have a lot of strength. We'll continue to execute in the future.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nThat's helpful, Dave. This is a little pie in the sky, but AI, the cooling of the CHIPS, when you start talking about, I think it's something like 5kW going to 100kW, and there's a lot of heat there. I'm told there's a lot of white space because, quite frankly, the cooling of those CHIPS is still—whether we go all liquid or whether there's other kind of hybrid solutions. Are you guys involved at all or perhaps working on technologies to be involved at all in some of that CHIPS-level cooling?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, absolutely. You're talking about emerging cooling, and that's certainly on the cutting edge. Yeah, we're very active there. In fact, we made an equity investment in a Company called LiquidStack, which is really—that's their expertise. We're partnering with them, and yeah, we're certainly on the leading edge of that technology.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Best of luck. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right, thanks, Scott. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHow are you?\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? Dave, commercial HVAC bookings growth has remained really strong and low teens growth in EMEA, despite maybe a little bit of slowing against tough comps, as you talked about in the Americas. Have you seen any slowing in any of your main commercial HVAC verticals in the Americas, or is it really just tough comps? Would you say the main difference in EMEA is the strength of your thermal management systems build-out there? If it is, where are you in that build-out, and where are you in terms of bringing it into the US?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, Andy, I think commercial HVAC has been strong globally for us. I think the megatrends around decarbonization, they continue to intensify. We had a very strong start to the year here in the Americas. Order rates were up, low single digits, but the backlog grew, and that's a great thing. If you go to EMEA, I mean, yeah, I mean, the team there is just performing at a very high level. You hit it, right? Thermal Management Systems is—we have a differentiated technology, and we're winning with our customers. If you think about the commercial HVAC EMEA business, in 2022, it was up 20%.\nIn the first quarter, we were up 25%. Our equipment orders for commercial HVAC EMEA were up close to 40%. I mean, this is great. The team is executing well. The other thing, too, I'd point out is that margins were very, very strong in Europe as well. If you remember, a year ago, we were talking about more acute supply chain problems in Europe and a higher cost to serve our customers. We were with spot buys and expedited freight. You see that pulling through now with productivity that the team's been able to deliver. Very strong in EMEA, very strong in the Americas, and Asia-Pacific also performed quite well.\nOrder rates were up, low teens, and really broad-based, too, both in China and outside of China. Off to a great start here in 2023, and commercial HVAC business is certainly—we're seeing a lot of demand for our products.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nIt's helpful, Dave. I wanted to follow up on your comments on sort of the EMEA margin, maybe for Chris. You talk about price versus cost-benefit in Q1 for the year. I think you mentioned previously the 2% to 2.5% carryover price embedded in 2023. Has that gone up a bit? As Dave mentioned, is it really you're comping against sort of an easier—supply chains are better in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. That's sort of the big reason why the margins were much stronger in those regions versus the Americas. Are you investing maybe more in the Americas versus those other regions?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndy, it's a great question. If you go to EMEA margins first, I mean, if I go back a year ago, we saw very acute supply chain issues impacting that region and really, unfortunately, holding back revenue growth and lowering volumes. It also came with the product we got out the door, a lot of additional cost to serve our customers. A year ago, it was very difficult to get leverage in that region. What you're seeing coming through here in the first quarter, and you guys will see this in the 10Q that gets filed, you'll see 9% of price in EMEA and about 6.5% of volume. With that volume came strong leverage, and we're starting to see some productivity come through with a slowly but improving supply chain.\nI think about the margins around productivity improvements on a year-over-year basis, stronger volume with good incrementals, and pricing continues to remain strong in the region as well. Really nice start to that team. I think you mentioned a question on maybe price overall for the company. Enterprise-wide, on the full year, we're probably still in that 200 to 300 basis points on a full-year price. I would bias our full-year revenue growth more to the volume side than to the price side on the full year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with sort of the backlog outlook and orders. I guess one approach is just not report the orders when they're down in quarter. If we look at over the balance of the year, how are you thinking about the sort of the book-to-bill ratio, let's say? Just trying to understand a little bit better, Dave, your commentary around that $6 billion backlog at year-end, perhaps being a floor number. Any color as you're thinking about book-to-bill by region or the market in terms of commercial versus transport?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Look, our order rates for the first quarter were actually flattish, okay, but our backlog increased by $400 million. We thought we had a real high backlog at the end of 2022 at $6.9 billion. It's now $7.3 billion. We will enter 2024 with a very inflated backlog. We're kind of using $6 billion just to demonstrate the strength. If you think about our—if you think about any year we go into, the backlog typically represents about 20% of the forward revenue. We'll be far in excess of that going into 2024. The book-to-bill, if you just do the simple math on where I'm looking at our midpoint on revenue, yeah, it would come down a bit from what we're seeing right now.\nI would tell you the first quarter was exceptional. It was a little bit stronger than even we thought, especially on our commercial HVAC standpoint. Our commercial HVAC business, on a two-year stack in the first quarter, is up 35% for orders. I mean, it's very, very strong right now, and we're seeing a lot of demand. You heard Scott talk about some of the tailwinds that are to come. Some of the mega projects out there with the CHIPS and Science Act and IRA, as it starts to kick in here in hopefully the fourth quarter, that'll be an additional tailwind that we're going to see into 2024 and beyond.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. My second question would just be on the Americas operating margin for the year. I suppose one—I think some investors may have thought maybe you'd have higher operating leverage in the first half than the sort of mid-20s number because of price-cost, tailwinds to margins, and the last sort of bout of transformation savings, as well as the good volume growth. I understand the sort of investment reference that Chris had made. Anything else going on in that Americas margin? Also, when we're thinking about second-half operating leverage in the Americas, does that stay at that mid-20s rate that you've got in the first half? Anything sort of moving around there?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJulian, it's Chris. I'll jump in. Yeah. The Americas saw a nice margin expansion in the first quarter, 90 basis points up margin expansion, about 50 basis points EBITDA margin expansion, really led by our commercial HVAC business. We saw declines in residential in the quarter, and Thermo King was right in line with our expectations, ±. I think it's really just the combination of the mix in the quarter where residential volumes were down, but we saw very strong growth in commercial HVAC. I think on the guide, as we've guided Q2 and then raised the low end of the guide on both revenue and earnings on the full year, would suggest maybe some leverage.\nIt's a little lower second half versus first half. I'll tell you, we're very confident in our full-year guide. I think the performance in the first quarter was very strong. At the same time, we've got a strong backlog entering into the second quarter. As Dave talked about, the guide for the backlog going into 2024, we expect to be very high as well. We have a lot of confidence in the full-year guide. The first quarter, it's really our smallest quarter of the year. It's about 17% of our earnings on a full-year basis. Let's get into the cooling season, and we'll update you in a couple of months. We're really happy with where we started.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great, thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gotham. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nDoing well, thanks. Hey, I just wanted to ask if you're seeing any evidence of price elasticity in the residential channel, given the volumes are a little bit lower across the industry, or any sort of competitive price movements downward? Thanks.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gotham. It's Chris. I'll start. Look, I think pricing continues to be strong. As we expected in the quarter for residential, we're ready for the cooling season with the inventory we have on hand. We're not seeing anything from a price elasticity perspective that you're referring to. Things remain to be fairly disciplined as we see today, and we're ready for the cooling season.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nJust a quick follow-up. The M&A pipeline, if you could talk about what kinds of things you're looking at, and is it more of what we've seen before with technology add-ons? Anything sizable in the pipeline that might be attractive? Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Gotham, I'll start on that. At the end of the day, we're going to get an opportunity to see everything as a major global HVAC player in the second quarter. In the first quarter here, we announced NTA. Chris talked about that. It was actually announced yesterday. A great example of what we do really well. This is a technology in industrial process cooling. It's in EMEA. Great technology at an enterprise level. The revenue is less than 1% for the enterprise. Margins are nice, they fit nicely into the business. With our strong scale, with our strong channel, we're able to scale these acquisitions quite quickly.\nWe'll look at everything, we'll be disciplined, and we're going to continue to execute the strategy that we've been executing, too. We've had a lot of success with it.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh. How are you?\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI'm good, thanks. Much like Scott Davis, I think, getting the crap beaten out of me by earnings. Yeah, we'll try to keep the momentum going here. We've talked a lot about the backlog. Clearly, the trends there are impressive in terms of what that means for the revenue story. I guess I'd like to talk a little bit about how backlog margins have trended. I guess where I'm coming from is some of what the answers have already touched on is these opposing forces where supply chain and price costs seem like they should probably be improving in the backlog.\nYou also have some of these larger projects where I would imagine in commercial HVAC, maybe you're a lower margin upfront, and you get paid more on that longer tail of things like service. How would you carve that for us as you're thinking about the margin and backlog today, and maybe where that trends?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJosh, it's Chris. I'll start. We see the backlog is still over 90% non-residential. That would be primarily commercial HVAC plus our transport businesses globally. Price-cost, we like the margins and backlog. Remember that price scenario, that's going to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the balance of the year. Just to remind investors, we really led with price in 2022, and we're going to have a tough comp as we work throughout the year on incremental price. Our product management teams have done an outstanding job staying ahead of inflation over the last couple of years, and we were price-cost positive in the first quarter on a dollar basis and a margin basis.\nI think that's an opportunity. Again, that headline price number is going to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the year. We have a lot of confidence in the 25% or better operating leverage on the full year. That is going to come from multiple parts of the bridge, right? We're confident in the 20 to 30 basis points of price over cost. The first quarter start gives us confidence on that on the full-year basis. We expect to see good incrementals on volume, some productivity return as supply chain normalizes, and really leverage all parts of the P&L to go drive the performance for the year.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. I guess just sticking with the same kind of follow-up on some of the questions around some of these bigger projects, how do you think about the crowding out between more of the policy-led stuff and stimulus versus private? Obviously, a lot of focus on the higher interest rates and maybe tougher liquidity situation coming from the regional banks. I don't know how relevant that's going to be for HVAC retrofit. I guess the wrench can only turn so fast. We still have labor bottlenecks. Is there a crowding out that you guys think happens on kind of the IRA stuff maybe versus more private demand here over the next year or two?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, we haven't seen that to date, Josh. It's a good question. At the end of the day, we think there are all opportunities really in front of us. As far as labor shortages, we have so many programs in place now to really train all of our employees at grassroots level. That's starting to get a lot better for us. We're not concerned about any crowding out as far as being able to meet the demand. Our account managers, our sales team, they're all over this, right? They're well-trained, and they're able to go to the most attractive verticals and really drive demand. That's what we're seeing right now. You see it in our results. I mean, our order rates are just tremendous right now.\nI look at our team and what they've been able to do in EMEA right now and all those opportunities there that are, we talk about IRA, but there's other policies that are happening in Europe right now that are really helping drive demand, and we're able to capitalize upon it.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood call. Thanks. That's all, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right, thanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask on commercial HVAC demand. Obviously, orders can reflect a bunch of things: comps, lead times. When you were speaking with customers, do you sense any easing of demand, whether it's the result of macro uncertainty or just higher cost of financing?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Chris, good question. We haven't seen that yet. In fact, we continue to see very strong demand. I think the whole megatrends around decarbonization continue. The world's getting warmer, and we need to take action. More of our customers realize that. We have some solutions out there right now that can have a dramatic impact on how we decarbonize the built environment. We have not seen anything slowing down right now. That really is on a global basis for our commercial HVAC business. If you look at the Americas, we play across all verticals. I think there's like 14 different verticals that we track.\nMaybe there's a little bit of softness in office, but there's a lot of strength in high tech that we talked about earlier. Education continues to be strong. Europe, we've been strong really across many verticals with our solutions there. Asia-Pacific, again, very strong start to the year. We haven't seen any slowing yet, Chris. It's a great start to the year for Trane Technologies, and it gives us a lot of confidence in our full-year guide.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nAppreciate that. Following up on price-cost, the company had been running ahead or kind of staying price-cost positive. When we see the year-to-date reflation in metal, does that change how you're thinking about incremental price later in 2023 as you try to kind of maintain that staying ahead on price-cost into 2024? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Let me jump in, Chris. It's a dynamic market around tier-one metals. We started the year three, six months ago thinking we could be in a really deflationary environment, and that really hasn't proven through. As I said earlier, our product management team members have done an outstanding job thinking about cost inputs, value to the customer, and staying ahead on price. We remain confident that we're going to be price-cost positive on the year. The start in the first quarter gives us a lot of confidence on the 20 to 30 basis points price-cost spread that we have in the full-year guide.\nWe know that pricing gets to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the year. We remain nimble. If there's further movement of inflationary commodities, or we continue to see some inflation, certainly in tier two around wage and energy, which we have baked into the guide, if things were to become more inflationary, we have the nimbleness in the company, and I think the proven track record that we've priced effectively. We have a lot of confidence on where we're going to be on the full year, and ultimately just staying very nimble to what happens in the marketplace.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I appreciate that.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nDoing great. Doing great. Dave, just maybe I'll start on resume track. Interesting to see that it's flat, but your organic growth this quarter was down mid-single digits. I'm assuming pricing had to be up. First, do I get my, does my math right? It seems like volumes were probably down double digits. Direct volumes were down double digits in the Americas. My question is, is that right? Secondly, what kind of line of sight do you have to that improving, and what's embedded in the guide?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Yeah. Your math is about right. You think about it on a revenue basis, we were down mid-single digits. On a unit basis, we were down in the mid-teens. Pricing was positive in the business. It was a little bit less than the company average, which is the first time that's happened in a while. Again, we have some very strong comps here in the resume business. The sell-through, which is really how we're looking at this business right now, was flat, right? We don't see it falling off a cliff. If you look at inventory levels in our IWDs, our independent wholesale distributors, maybe they're a bit high, but that will normalize through Q2. Nothing alarming.\nThis is a business that we have a lot of innovation coming through. We have some great brands, some great products, great distributors, and a great management team. It's early in the year. It's the first quarter. We'll wait to see how the cooling season starts. We don't see this business falling off a cliff. We have this guide in our guide, okay? It gives us confidence in our guide with what we have projected right now.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Going back to the margins in EMEA, I mean, I know that you had an easier comp because of some of the issues that occurred last year. Still, a 17% margin in the business to start the year is pretty darn good. I guess my question is, is that kind of like the jumping-off point now for the rest of the year? I'm assuming revenue/volumes are going to be higher through the remaining three quarters. Is this kind of like the floor for margins in EMEA for the year?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Joe. It's Chris. Look, our expectation for the region would be that they'll deliver 25% or better leverage on the full year, organic leverage on the full year. Q1's off to a nice start. As you said, and as we commented before, it's really an easier comp versus some real challenges we had in the business a year ago. Supply chain got better as we got to the end part of 2022. The fourth quarter, we saw strong revenue growth in EMEA from our Commercial HVAC business. They were really hurt first and hard with the supply chain challenges. We have a lot of confidence the team can deliver this year, and the backlog continues to grow with their innovative products.\nLet's see how it kind of plays out. We're confident we're going to deliver strong margin improvement on a full-year basis for the region. Keep in mind, TK EMEA, markets there are expected to be down low to mid-single digits. We expect to outperform. All in, we expect to have a strong year in the EMEA segment this year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nJoe, you're right. Joe, again, you have just a great start to Europe. It really is. I'm so proud of what that team's been able to deliver. So fantastic.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thanks, guys. See you next week.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSee you. Sounds good.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Congrats on the execution on the quarter.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYou had 9% price in EMEA. I know we can wait for the queue. What was it in the other two segments?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Steve, it's Chris. It was a little over 6 points in Americas. Think of that as 6.6 points of price in the Americas, pretty much in line with the enterprise. EMEA, we said 8.9 points of price. Asia was around 4 points of price in the quarter.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Just in the back half here, there's kind of strange comps from last year. You had the China dynamics. Europe had a pretty good second half as well on volume. How do we—I know you don't like to kind of guide by quarter, but you guided to high singles. You're running in the first half at high singles so far. Are there any comps in the back half that are volatile, or is it pretty smooth? Maybe just help us out with the non-US businesses and how you expect organic growth year-over-year to play out in Q3 and Q4.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think as we get to the fourth quarter—well, let me start with Asia, right? Given the lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, we saw muted growth in Q2 a year ago. The business was able to recover very nicely in the third and fourth quarter last year. Asia may have a little bit of tougher comps in the second half, just given the cadence of how earnings played out and the lockdowns from COVID played out in China a year ago. I mentioned just earlier in EMEA, for commercial HVAC, the business really through the third quarter of last year had some very acute supply chain challenges. We're not out of the woods yet, but that continued to get better in the fourth quarter.\nWe saw that getting better here in the first quarter as well. I think we're fingers crossed that that continues to be a nice tailwind for the business in a year-to-year. As you get later in the year, I think you'll see a little bit of a headwind as we get to the fourth quarter there. TK, if I go to the Americas side of the house, the back half of the year for TK Americas, that'll be a bit of a tough comp. Very strong growth we saw in the third and fourth quarter in the Americas last year. Yeah, there's a little bit of tough comps coming in the second half in a few of the businesses. We have such strength in the commercial HVAC businesses as well that we're really confident in the full-year guide.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I just want to clarify some of these resume numbers. You said revs down mid-singles. The sell-through comment being flat, is that revenue, or is that units?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat'd be revenue, Steve. That'd be revenue.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, revenue. Okay, that makes more sense. Basically, through your independence, your volume was down probably more, I don't know, like 20% or something like that, just through the independence.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. They certainly normalized their inventory in the first quarter. We've been seeing that happen. Like I said earlier, inventory may be a bit high, but it really depends on how the cooling season kicks off. It's the first quarter, right? As you know, this is the smallest quarter. We'll wait till the cooling season starts, and hopefully, it starts real soon.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHow's April so far?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think the cooling season hasn't started, so we're still in that shoulder part of the year. We'll see. It's forecasted to get real warm here in May, so we'll see how it goes.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAll right, rely on those weather forecasts, as always. All right, thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Take care, Steve. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, all.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey. Doing great, thanks. Hey, just one follow-up on resume, then just a different topic on the M&A from you. Just the price in resume below the 6.5% range. A little surprised to hear that, given the steer change and the mix effect associated with that. Maybe you're not including mix when you say price, or perhaps you're still selling a lot of older units in the quarter. Could you just maybe clarify a little bit what's going on there?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJeff, you're right. We're not including the price benefit from the steer change in that price number. We consider that as part of volume. This would be more pure on a year-to-year basis. Put that as mix, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nAll right. We'll call it mix. Thank you. Just on the deals, a 2% revenue impact, right, on the $16 billion revenue base last year, that's $320 million of sales you're guiding for the partial year on deals, right, on $500 million expended. That sounds like a pretty good chunk of revenue for that amount of dollars spent. Maybe just a little color on the margin rates in these businesses. Do I have that math right? What percentage of the year do you expect what you just announced to actually be in the year? When does this stuff close?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Yeah, Jeff, it really is the contribution of three acquisitions that's leading to that roughly 2 points of revenue growth from M&A in 2023. One relates to the Alco acquisition we closed in October of last year. You've got about nine months of that revenue coming through in 2023 that we're calling out as inorganic. Fourth quarter would be a comp. It would just be part of our organic results. Dave just mentioned we closed on NTA just yesterday. It is an industrial process cooling business in EMEA. We'll start picking up the revenues from that business, also a partial year. Think of that as, okay, eight months of revenue this year.\nThe pending acquisition that we've announced in the life sciences vertical in the Americas, that's not closed yet. We expect that to close sometime in the second quarter. We've made an estimate of that here in the full year. All in, it's the combination of those three businesses that's getting us to roughly 2 points of revenue growth. The contribution margin in year one, it's low, just given the integration costs. We have a great track record of taking bolt-on acquisitions and bringing them into our channels, selling through with our robust sales forces, and ultimately really driving very strong returns in subsequent years.\nIn the year, it's about $0.03 positive on an EPS basis with that leverage. Ultimately, we'll see how it kind of plays out for the year. It's still positive and slightly accretive on the year.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat, thanks for the detail.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou got it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Dave. I don't know about your neighborhood, but it's still pretty cold up here, so make sure you pack something warm next week.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt's warming up. It's warming up, Nigel. It's warming up. It's warming up.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Yeah, it's coming. It's coming. Obviously, one of your competitors is making a pretty big splash in the European residential markets. How would you characterize the importance of Trane being a player in European residential heating specifically? I'm not saying a multi-billion-dollar deal, but do you see opportunities to be a player there in a smaller scale, perhaps?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Great question. I mean, we really like our portfolio in Europe. You think about it in the commercial HVAC space where we play, we're having a lot of success. We have differentiated offerings that we're able to provide to our customers, and you see the results. I mean, our thermal management systems there, we've eliminated or significantly reduced the need for fossil fuel for heating in all geographic climates. You could see the team's results. Like I said earlier, our revenue in 2022, up 20%. First quarter, 25%. Equipment revenue, 40%. We're going to continue to execute on our strategy in Europe. We're having a lot of success.\nThe team is high-powered and performing extremely well, and we have so much innovation that's coming through the pipeline that I get excited just talking about it. As I said earlier, we get the opportunity to look at a lot of M&A deals being a global HVAC player. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to be disciplined. We'll make sure we make the right investments for Trane Technologies and our shareholders.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave. Maybe for Chris, we're coming up to the end of the $3 million program, just transformation savings. Is this it? Is this the end of kind of the big project we move, or do you see the potential for another wave, perhaps, of initiatives?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Nigel, thanks for the question. Look, we're on really good track to realize the incremental $60 million of savings this year. We continue to deploy that back into the business through reinvestment and innovation in the portfolio. It also gives us confidence on delivering 25% or better operating leverage on the full year. The company has always prided itself on lean thinking. I would tell you that as we move forward, there's always going to be opportunities for us to lean out operations and drive cost improvements. I think another area of opportunity for the company is the ability to call back on some of the productivity that's been very challenged over the last few years to deliver on.\nSupply chain challenges, higher cost to serve customers. Dave's talked in past calls about spot buys and being exposed to those markets and higher costs. Those are really great opportunities for the company to get back to basics, get back to productivity, offsetting other inflation. We're seeing a little bit of that come through in the first quarter with our commercial EMEA business. We'll see how that kind of plays out for the year. I would tell you that we'll update you more as we work throughout the year. I'm really excited on the productivity side, and I'm excited we still have a lot more opportunities to take cost out in the business.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nDoing real well. Thank you. Question about indoor air quality. Has the whole urgency around that theme faded? Understandably, you've showcased all the decarbonization benefits and climate change, and that makes perfect sense. Has the driver of indoor air quality, has that faded at all? Originally, you were talking about a 200 basis points lift for quite a period of time.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's a good question. I mean, we've embedded indoor air quality into our applied systems. I would tell you that I've been in this industry a long time. Ten years ago, we used to just have the conversation about indoor air quality in the healthcare vertical. We have that now in all verticals. You might not read about it, but I would tell you it's still prevalent. We talk about it with our customers, and they talk about it with us. I mean, I think everyone's been educated on the importance of indoor air quality, the importance of fresh air exchange, the importance of being able to balance that with energy consumption.\nWe've done a great job of helping our customers work through that. No, it's certainly part of our business. It's certainly part of our offering. It's top of mind of many of our customers.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, I see that with the education stimulus spending, that it's usually one of the top priorities.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAll right. Second question on the incremental 70 basis points of spending reinvestment. Can you give us some examples of where that's going, and a sense of the returns?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, we really like the digital space. We really like the electrification of our portfolio. We really like optimizing our operations with automation, just to name a few. Our innovation pipeline is very robust. It's very full. Three times a year, I actually get to—we have a deep dive on our innovation pipeline. It's the best four hours I spend sometimes in the quarter because it's just so exciting to talk to our engineers and to see what they've invented and the impact that it can have on not only decarbonizing the built environment, but really helping our customers save on energy costs and improve indoor air quality.\nIt's very robust right now. We love to invest in our business. We have a proven track record here, and we're going to continue to do that more in the future as well.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nDeane, I'd add on the investment side. We had a normal level of investments in the first quarter. Wanted to highlight that into the second quarter, we do expect that level of investments to ramp up to 70 basis points. We still see that being around 70 basis points for the full year. That will be a ramp up into Q2 as we just continue to see very strong projects, as Dave outlined. Let me come back to just a comment on EMEA as well. There are a lot of questions around EMEA margins. Maybe just to highlight, in the first quarter, we saw growth both in Commercial HVAC and in the Thermo King business.\nImportant to know that the Thermo King markets in Europe are expected to be down low to mid-single. We're probably not expecting to see that outgrowth in Thermo King each and every quarter of the year. That's going to be an area we'll see how the year plays out. Nice to see both businesses deliver in Q1. That'll be a little lumpy and choppy as we think about Thermo King for the balance of the year.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nHi, yes. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andrew. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nI'm good. I'm good. Just to follow up on institutional spending, can you just chat clearly key market schools you've talked about? Can you talk about what's happening with the hospital spending? I know there was a pullback during COVID because of the budgetary issues. Are we sort of seeing cumulative catch-up, or are hospitals still in trouble? If you could just talk about that key end market. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we've been strong in the healthcare vertical forever, I think. As I said, we track all 14 different verticals. Healthcare is certainly one that we have a lot of strength in. Really, the reason why we have the strength there, Andrew, is it's a complex sale. Hospitals have varying degrees of requirements, especially around fresh air exchange. You're going to have a different application in a surgical suite versus what you're going to have in a hospital room. We're still seeing strength in healthcare. To be fair, we've always seen strength in healthcare because our solutions are really built around those kind of more complex situations that we're able to capitalize on.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nYeah, just to follow up, headlines on pricing, I think Daikin can introduce lower-priced products in the US on the resin side. I think we've heard yesterday at a meeting that Aaon, it's the first sort of price they rescinded, a price increase actually on the commercial side. As supply chains are getting looser, do you feel that people can get more competitive, or you think there's still enough demand there to support steady pricing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndrew, I'd say, look, demand remains strong. It's an industry that typically retains price and is disciplined on price. I won't necessarily talk about potential pricing actions we may do throughout the year. As I mentioned before, our product management teams, our business units have done an outstanding job taking all the inputs in to lead on price the last two years, and a good, strong performance here in the first quarter as well. I do think we'll remain proactive and be prudent. I think our track record hopefully speaks for itself that we can really have a lot of confidence on the 20 or 30 basis points of price over cost in the year.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Resarch, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much. As I said, great execution.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andrew. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem. How are you, Nicole?\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood, thanks. There's been a lot of focus on the EMEA margins on this call, but the Asia-Pacific margins and the operating leverage was also really, really strong. Can we just talk about how you guys are seeing that progressing through the rest of the year?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Nicole, it's Chris. I would say certainly the second quarter, but even in the first quarter last year, we saw some parts of the China economy and these COVID lockdowns. As we entered into lockdown, it certainly cost a lot more money to keep customers happy and trying to get products out where you could in limited situations. Now we're comping against a little bit easier comps as we think about the first half of 2023. First off, the demand in Asia remains very strong. We continue to expect very strong performance from the team, and they had a great first quarter.\nComps probably get a little bit better in the second half given the partial reopening we saw in the second half of 2022. Look, very strong growth, not only on the revenue side, but bookings were up high teens for Commercial HVAC in Asia. Services were up nearly 25% in the quarter. I think our innovation, and then the verticals that we play in Asia, really played through very well in the year. Great job by our team there.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks for noticing, Nicole. I mean, Asia, sometimes we don't talk enough about it, but what a great leadership team we have there. They really have been leaders for Trane Technologies with innovation. The team just executed extremely well in the first quarter, a great start to the year. To be fair, all of our segments really executed very strongly in the quarter. It just speaks to the resiliency of our portfolio, and it just gives us lots of confidence in our full-year guide. Certainly appreciate the question.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks. On the TK order book, are you guys now fully booked out to 2023? I guess what's the status of the order book, is it actually open to accept new orders? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Nicole. We opened up the second half of the year order book mid to late March. Orders started to come in a little bit in the first quarter, but we would expect that to really get filled up in the second quarter. We have a lot of confidence that from what we can see with the backlog entering Q2 and the forward look, our guide in the full year, we're going to outperform the markets both in the Americas and in EMEA for the full year.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, I'll pass it on.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nicole.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Great to be joining you for the first time. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Would love to dig into the services trend a little bit more. I mean, that 25% year-over-year in China, maybe to the extent that reopening played into that, and you can comment. Just the overall trends in services and how you expect that to trend over the course of the year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, services is a great part of Trane Technologies. It represents about 1/3 of our total business. If you look at it over a five-year period, we've had a compound annual growth rate globally in our service business in high single digits. In the first quarter, we were double digits. I mean, it's a really strong business. It really differentiates us with our customers. In China, yeah, really strong start to the year. Some of that was obviously the comps year-over-year just because they had a lot of restrictions still, specifically in China at this time last year. I would tell you, our service business is a very strong business.\nWe invest heavily in our service business. It's a great business, and it's very, very resilient as well. Even during 2020 COVID, where we did not have access to many buildings, our service business was flat. These products are more and more sophisticated today, and they require OEM service, and we are able to provide that for our customers. Thanks for the question. I mean, services is a big part of who we are as Trane Technologies.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYeah, that actually ties into the next question. I think in talking about the incremental spend, you called out the digital investments and maybe pulling forward some of that. Just would love an understanding of the roadmap to the extent you can share with us, and how that plays into the services strategy. Are we looking at some meaningful refreshes or additions to the digital suite over the course of the year?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo. Look, being connected to our assets is nothing new to Trane Technologies. We're connected to over, what's the number now? Well over 30,000 buildings, millions of different assets. We love being connected to our assets. Now think about the next is how do you even get smarter with all the data that you have and think about how you could actually have buildings operate more efficiently. I talk about digital. Those are the things that we're working on. It's no longer the service tech gets deployed when something's not operating properly. It's not operating properly because it's using too much energy.\nThat's the space that we're into here. We really like the digital space and service, and it really is a tailwind to our service business.\n\nNoah Kaye\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAll right, thanks so much.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Zach Nagel for closing remarks.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, we'll be around to answer any questions that you have today and in the coming days and weeks. We'll also be on the road at a couple of conferences. We'll be looking forward to seeing folks on the road or in person through a variety of events soon. Thanks, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' 4Q 2022 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law.\nPlease see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zac, and everyone for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to slide number three. Before we dive in, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our differentiated financial results and long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like climate change, which has serious and far-reaching effects on the environment, the economy, and human health.\n2022 was again one of the warmest years on record, and we continue to see extreme weather events. Urgent action is needed to accelerate our transition to a low-carbon, green economy. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. Our innovation is transforming the industry and accelerating decarbonization of commercial buildings, homes, and transport. We're helping our customers advance their own sustainability goals while contributing to our Gigaton Challenge, a pledge to reduce customers' emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030.\nOur purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation, and strong customer focus enable us to deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins, and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide number four, our global team delivered strong performance in 2022.\nAs we compare our results to peers and the broader industrials, we're confident our organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth will again rank in the top quartile for both the 4Q and for the full year. Our global teams have demonstrated resiliency and tenacity, navigating persistent inflation, supply chain, and a myriad of other macro-related challenges globally. They've executed our business operating system, which is designed for operational excellence, and delivered record results across virtually all key metrics.\nThroughout 2022, and building on extraordinary strength in 2021, we are continuing to see our relentless year-in, year-out, rain or shine, reinvestment and innovation pay dividends through unprecedented levels of customer demand. While this demand has been broad-based, we're seeing particular strength in our non-residential businesses, led by commercial HVAC. Global commercial HVAC organic bookings were up nearly 40% in 2022 on a two-year stack.\nAmericas commercial HVAC bookings were up more than 40% on a two-year stack. The tremendous growth we've delivered over the past two years has driven absolute bookings to record levels. We continue to encourage investors to look at absolute bookings levels, in addition to growth rates, to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our businesses and our backlog.\nAs an example, our commercial HVAC organic revenues were up more than 20% in the 4Q, while organic bookings were higher by about half that level, up 11%. Still, the book-to-bill was over 105%, further adding to our already record backlog. Likewise, while enterprise organic revenues were up 16% in the quarter and organic bookings were flat, total book-to-bill was still 100%. Customer demand, absolute bookings, and absolute backlog have never been higher.\nWe disclose absolute bookings and revenues each quarter by segment in our earnings release. 2022 bookings of $17.5 billion exceeded 2022 revenues by $1.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 109%. Backlog entering 2023 is $7 billion, well over two times historical norms. Further, we expect backlog to remain elevated throughout 2023, and anticipate entering 2024 with backlog in excess of $6 billion.\nAt our guidance midpoint revenue growth rate of 7%, 2023 revenues would be approximately $17.2 billion. When compared to bookings of $17.5 billion in 2022, bookings would need to decline by over $1.1 billion in order for backlog to fall to the $6 billion number that I referenced heading into 2024. That would equate to a decline of about $275 million per quarter. For backlog to return to more normal levels of approximately $3 billion, bookings would need to decline by over $4 billion, or more than $1 billion per quarter.\nWhile we recognize that we have difficult comps in 2023, we have a high degree of confidence that bookings will remain robust, and that we will enter 2024 with backlog of $6 billion or more. Turning to our guidance for 2023, we expect continued strong revenue growth, EPS growth, and free cash flow. We have a proven strategy to outperform end markets, and our business operating system enables us to deliver consistent, strong execution despite challenging macro environments.\nWe have a multi-year track record of delivering differentiated financial performance for shareholders, and are well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the long term. Please turn to slide number five. As I discussed at the outset, I am proud of our global teams for delivering strong performance in 2022 despite persistent macro challenges. We significantly exceeded our revenue and EPS growth targets while delivering solid leverage and free cash flow, and returning significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While free cash flow was strong at 91% of adjusted net earnings for the year, we fell short of our target of 100% free cash flow conversion.\nWe drove an exceptional volume of shipments in the month of December in our Commercial HVAC and Thermo King businesses to meet customer demand, which shifted the timing of approximately $150 million in receivables into the first quarter of 2023. We also invested about $40 million in safety stock inventory in the 4Q to ensure continuity of supply in this dynamic environment. Net of these two areas, free cash flow would have been 100%. Please turn to slide number six.\nOne of the most important elements of our long-term strategy is fueling our high-performance flywheel through relentless investments and innovation to solve our customers' most complex problems. Leading customer innovation drives consistent and profitable market outgrowth, which in turn drives more cash to reinvest back into the business to further accelerate growth. This flywheel, as we refer to it, is one of the key differentiators between Trane Technologies and our competition. We are unwavering in our commitment to invest heavily in our business year after year, in good times and in bad.\nIt's this ongoing focus that has enabled us to drive differentiated financial performance for shareholders over time. Over the past five years, including the pandemic in 2020, we delivered a 7% revenue compound annual growth rate, 250 basis points of margin expansion, free cash flow conversion well in excess of 100%, and since 2017, we've deployed more than $13 billion in capital, with $8.3 billion returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nLooking forward, you can expect us to continue to consistently reinvest in our business, and we'll talk later in the presentation about some of the ways in which we are accelerating investments in 2023, leveraging the strong outlook we see entering the year. Overall, we are exceptionally well positioned to continue our strong track record of performance and capital deployment over the long term. Please turn to slide number seven. As I discussed earlier in the presentation, customer demand for our innovative products and services is at record levels, with particular strength in our non-residential businesses, which comprise approximately 80% of our portfolio.\nAmericas commercial HVAC was again a standout, with low teens bookings growth and mid-teens revenue growth, including another quarter of high single-digit services revenue growth. Bookings were up nearly 40% on a two-year stack, resulting in high absolute dollar bookings and a book-to-bill ratio of over 110%.Backlog continued to grow from an already high base and is now at levels that are three times historical norms, further adding to our visibility and confidence in our guidance for 2023.\nIn residential, bookings continued to normalize and were down mid-20s in the quarter. The decline was expected against a very high prior year comp, as two-year stack bookings were still up double digits. Residential revenues were up low single digits in the quarter, and sell-through was up mid-single digits, reflecting healthy end market demand. We continue to have historically high backlog in our residential business, and in the 4Q, we worked closely with our independent wholesale distributors, or IWDs, to help them manage their inventory positions and mix as they entered 2023. Our goal was to mitigate the risk of stranded inventory across the channel.\nI'm pleased with the approach we took and the partnership with our channel. We believe our IWDs are in a good inventory position entering 2023 as a result. Our Americas Thermo King business had another very strong quarter with 30% revenue growth. This follows growth of more than 60% in Q3. We've included our traditional transport refrigeration market overview slide near the back of the presentation, which shows the strong share gains for our Thermo King businesses globally in 2021 and 2022.\nBookings were down modestly, as expected, but still up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Backlog in this business remains at historically high levels, providing good visibility into future revenues. Overall, Americas backlog is unprecedented at three times historical levels. Turning to EMEA, results in the quarter were also very strong. In our commercial HVAC business, we've highlighted acute supply chain challenges that have been impacting revenues and, more importantly, leverage throughout 2022.\nWe were able to overcome many of these challenges in the 4Q and delivered revenue growth in excess of 40% with strong leverage. Services growth was once again robust, up double digits. Bookings were also robust, up low teens, with two-year stack bookings up more than 20%. We're seeing tremendous demand for our thermal management systems, which are three to four times more efficient than conventional heating and cooling. Our transport refrigeration business in EMEA also delivered strong performance with low single-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter in a market that was down double digits. We discussed the transport refrigeration business in detail on slide 16 of the presentation.\nOverall, EMEA backlog remains elevated, 40% higher than historical norms. Turning to Asia Pacific, the commercial HVAC team delivered another very strong quarter in Q4, with revenues up more than 20% and services up mid-teens. Asia bookings were down, as expected, related to tough prior year comps on large bookings in the high-tech sector outside of China. Two-year stack bookings were still up high teens. China was resilient in the quarter, with bookings up high single digits and revenue up double digits. Overall, Asia backlog remains elevated, approximately 50% above historical norms. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number eight. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenues were up 16%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 34% versus prior year. We delivered strong organic enterprise growth in both equipment and services, up high teens and low teens, respectively. Services growth was consistently strong throughout 2022, and our services mix is approximately 32% of enterprise revenues. Strong services mix bolsters the company's resiliency in virtually all market conditions. Please turn to slide number nine.\nWe've discussed the key revenue dynamics for the quarter, so I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments. The key margin drivers are the same for each of our businesses, so we've consolidated the highlights on the right side of the page. Robust volume growth, positive price realization, and modestly positive productivity more than offset persistent material and other inflation in the quarter. We also leveraged strong margin expansion across the businesses to accelerate investments and innovation across a number of key initiatives.\nAs mentioned previously, we are pleased with the significant progress we've made over the past two quarters mitigating acute supply chain challenges in our EMEA businesses, which led to strong volume growth, coupled with significant margin expansion in the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 10. As we discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher, with historically high levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, leading brands with strong market positions, customer focus, and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market outgrowth over time. In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains, as demonstrated by our full year 2022 order growth that is more than 40% on a two-year stack.\nWe have exited the 4Q with elevated backlog that is three times historical norms, providing us significant visibility into future revenues. The non-residential markets remain strong, and we are bullish on the outlook for commercial HVAC. Demand continues to be robust in data centers, education, healthcare, and the high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long-term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization, and indoor environmental quality, which are only growing stronger.\nWe also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy-related drivers, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, education stimulus, and the CHIPS and Science Act. Our commercial HVAC business is well positioned as the premier franchise to capitalize on the significant market opportunities that lie ahead. The residential market outlook remains dynamic. Near term, we see the market continuing to normalize across bookings and revenue, and the process is well underway, as we saw in the third and 4Qs.\nFor 2023, we believe this normalization process results in market units likely down in the mid-single digit range. With tailwinds from elevated backlog, pricing, supportive regulatory and policy initiatives, and share gains, we believe our revenues will be relatively flat. Our guidance encompasses scenarios for residential in the plus or minus low single digits range. We don't see a cliff scenario, and residential is about 20% of our business, so a 10% decline would present a 2% headwind to the enterprise. Longer term, we continue to see residential as a GDP-plus business for us.\nTurning to Americas transport refrigeration, our diversified portfolio of products and aftermarket significantly outperformed the end markets in 2021 and 2022. ACT is calling for low single-digit growth in trailer in 2023 and for weighted average transport refrigeration growth to be flattish. Consistent with our strong track record, we expect to outperform the end markets in 2023. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP++ business. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section.\nTurning to EMEA commercial HVAC, the market growth picture remains muted, with macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges weighing. Given our innovative and leading sustainability solutions, we've been able to significantly outgrow the EMEA HVAC markets over a long period of time. We see continued opportunities for market outgrowth going forward, aided by our thermal management systems, which are three to four times more efficient than traditional heating and cooling solutions, and are gaining momentum in the market.\nTurning to EMEA transport refrigeration, the removal of the Russian market was a key driver of the market decline in 2022. Thermo King EMEA outgrew the end markets, up high single digits for the year. As we turn to 2023, we expect the market to be down low single digits to mid-single digits, mainly related to economic uncertainty in the region. Our innovative products and solutions continue to provide us with a strong platform to outgrow our end markets, which we expect to do again in 2023.\nTurning to Asia, the environment remains dynamic, and COVID continues to add complexity and unpredictability to the market forecasts. We see continued strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare verticals. If these markets continue to perform well, we could continue to see relatively stable growth in 2023. Asia continues to be one of the more dynamic markets, so we're cautiously optimistic on this segment, which represents about 10% of our portfolio. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 11. Dave provided a good framework for how we're looking at our key end markets for 2023, and our guidance reflects these views. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in high levels of business reinvestment in innovation, outgrowth across our end markets, and strong leverage. We're guiding 2023 to 6% to 8% organic revenue growth and $8.20 to $8.50 in adjusted earnings per share, or approximately 11% to 15% EPS growth.\nThrough the back half of last year, we talked about ending 2022 with $6 billion or more in backlog, and we're sitting at a record level of $7 billion as of the beginning of 2023. This gives us good visibility into 2023 revenues. We have approximately 1% of growth from M&A in 2023, from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2022, and we expect FX to be neutral on a full-year basis. We're targeting organic leverage of 25%+ for the year. There are a few key factors that play into our organic leverage target, so I'll spend a couple of minutes covering these factors to help frame the guidance. First, we're expecting modest incremental price, and solid volumes to offset material and other inflation, and drive strong incremental margins.\nSecond, while we're expecting slow and steady improvement in the supply chain as we've seen throughout 2022, we're not expecting it to be fully normalized until well into 2023 at the earliest. This will continue to put pressure on the realization of strong productivity, which is where our business operating system really thrives. Third, the environment around prices for tier one metals remains dynamic. In the 3Q and early part of the 4Q last year, we saw a deflationary trend for base metal prices. However, pricing has increased over the last two months on copper, aluminum, and steel, negating much of the potential deflationary benefit in 2023.\nTo update you on a question from our earnings call last quarter, our tier one spend on these metals is approximately $750 million, split roughly 1/3 each for copper, aluminum, and steel. We are seeing modest deflation in freight and logistics costs, but we're also seeing inflation from tier two suppliers as they incur higher than normal wage increases and energy costs. Net, we're not baking in significant inflation or deflation into our guidance at this early stage in the year.\nFourth, we're using the favorable environment we see in 2023 as an opportunity to double down on key investments across the business in advanced manufacturing and automation, digital, and electrification platforms, among other key programs. We're targeting 20 to 30 basis points of incremental spend across these areas, which will be embedded in the segment P&Ls. This is above and beyond our average incremental spend of approximately 40 basis points per year. We're targeting 60 to 70 basis points of incremental spend in total.\nWe've highlighted that business reinvestment is how we win over the long term, and we're confident we can make these investments in 2023 while hitting our guidance range. We have additional investments earmarked in our corporate and CapEx guidance as well. Lastly, while our M&A transactions I referenced earlier will have a strong payout over the next several years, they will add about 1% to our revenue at approximately 3% leverage in the first year, inclusive of integration costs.\nThe net effect cuts about 2 percentage points off of our enterprise reported leverage versus our organic leverage that excludes M&A. It's not a huge amount, but it's something we wanted to highlight as a factor to consider in our guidance, as organic leverage will be stronger than reported leverage, simply on the math related to M&A. We'll highlight organic leverage each quarter to provide transparency. Turning to cash, we expect 2023 to be a strong cash collection year. We have about $150 million in receivables that shifted from December into early Q1. Barring persistent supply chain issues all year, which we do not anticipate, we expect to bring working capital levels down, specifically around inventory.\nNet, free cash flow conversion should be 100% or better. Please go to slide number 12. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation, including an incremental $60 million in 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings into high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio, and I discussed a number of targeted investments for 2023.\nTo be clear, our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system and continues well beyond the transformation program that we started in 2020 when we launched Trane Technologies. Our business operating system is designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been impossible to realize that level of gross productivity over the past three years, given the tumultuous macroeconomic backdrop, productivity has been improving as supply chains slowly recover and is contributing to our 25%+ organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to slide number 13.\nWe remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value.\nPlease turn to slide number 14, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. In 2022, we executed strong and balanced capital allocation of $2.1 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion to share repurchases, $620 million to dividends, and approximately $250 million to M&A. We're targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2023 and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we continue to exercise discipline in our approach.\nOur shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value, and we have approximately $3.2 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 16. Our Thermo King businesses have significantly outperformed their end markets in both 2021 and 2022, as illustrated on the table on the right-hand side of the page. In 2022, the North America transport refrigeration markets were up 12%, while Thermo King Americas was up more than 20%. The EMEA transport refrigeration markets were down 9% in 2022, while Thermo King EMEA was up high single digits. We're very pleased with the share gains we've achieved over the past two years.\nIn 2023, we expect the markets to be flat to modestly down, and for Thermo King to once again outperform, consistent with our strong track record. We also added additional information to the slide this quarter to help investors and analysts gain a better understanding of the size of the businesses. We've included a footnote that global Thermo King is approximately 15% of our enterprise revenue, and the split between the Thermo King segments is roughly 60% Americas, 35% EMEA, and 5% Asia. Please turn to slide number 17.\nACT has updated their long-term forecast for refrigerated trailers through 2027. The data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time now, that this is a mid-40,000 unit market, ±10%. The chart plots the actual and forecast, but the key takeaway is that the market is expected to be flat at 45,000 units in 2023, dip to 40,000 units in 2024, rebound back to 45,000 units in 2025, and continue growing low single digits from that point forward to 2027. Additionally, our transport refrigeration business is a diversified portfolio with a healthy aftermarket business. We have strong positions in large and small trucks, APUs, bus, air, and rail, and a proven track record to outperform the transport refrigeration markets.\nWe believe this is a GDP++ business for us over the long term. Please go to slide number 18. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify, driving increased demand for our innovative products and services. We are delivering leading technologies and innovation to address these trends and accelerate the world's progress, underpinned by our engaging, uplifting culture.\nThe strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team, unprecedented backlog, and continued high levels of customer demand give us confidence in our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team, and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, everyone, that is star one to ask a question. Again, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMorning. Maybe just the first question around any thoughts on sort of the cadence of the organic sales trend, the 7% through the year, any sort of particularly awaiting early versus late in the year, and also that 25%+ core leverage goal for the year. Again, is there anything in kind of price cost or the investment spend weighting that skews that first half versus second half at all?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, good morning, Julian. This is Chris. I'll start, and then Dave may jump in. As we think about the cadence throughout 2023, let me start with the first quarter. Q1 is typically around 11% to 12% of our full-year earnings. Right now, we would project Q1 to be a bit stronger than that, than our historical average. It's probably in the 15% to 16% range of full-year earnings.\nWe see that around really between $1.30 and $1.35 on Adjusted EPS. I think the revenue growth in terms of the first quarter is roughly in line with how we see kind of the full year at this point. We see leverage being really 25%+ really throughout the year. We see it's roughly balanced. The investment spend really is going to be ratable throughout the year. We've been many years, of course, with investments and leading in innovation, but I see that spend really being roughly equal throughout the year. Dave, anything you want to add?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo, I just think, Hi, Julian. How are you doing? First of all, Chris talked a little bit about our leverage of 25%+. Could there be a quarter where that's higher? Sure, absolutely, based on where we see opportunities. I would tell you, from my vantage point, we love to reinvest in our business. We love to find opportunities to drive differentiated revenue growth on the top line. The flywheel that I referred to in my opening comments, it's something that has a proven track record for us. As an innovation leader in the industry, we plan on that continuing well into the future.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful, thank you. If we're looking at the sort of markets of residential and then transport on a global basis, are we assuming that the resi weakness is more sort of first half and the transport weakness more pronounced in the second half? Is that the right way to think about those two pieces?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, I mean, let's start with residential. I think we're pretty clear in our comments there. We think residential for the full year will be down the mid-single digit range. We think that based on some of the tailwinds that we have in our own business, being strong backlog, strong price, we'll see some tailwinds probably later in the year with some regulatory changes, specifically around IRA. We see that as we'll be ±1% in residential.\nOn Thermo King, if you look at the Americas and you look at ACT-specific data, right now they have that as a stronger first half or second half, but that assumes, Julian, that the trailer OEMs will actually be able to hit the production rates. We haven't seen them demonstrate that. My belief is that some of that volume will actually push towards the second half from the first half, but we'll see how the year plays out.\nAs far as in Europe, Thermo King, we think the market will be down. A lot of that is the economic conditions there. In both cases, whether the Americas or in Europe, we plan on outperforming the markets as we've demonstrated our capability over the last two years.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nGood morning. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Gautam. How are you?\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nDoing well.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nHey, I just wanted to ask you about, are you seeing any evidence of weakness in the forward project pipeline on the commercial HVAC in that domain? Or do you see any—\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI'm sorry, Chris. I'm just curious. Yeah. I'm sorry, Gautam. Weakness in the forward— Yeah. No, actually, if you look at our commercial HVAC businesses on a global basis, right, lots of strength in the Americas, really across many verticals, which is always a good sign. We do not see that slowing down. In fact, we see some tailwinds towards the back half of the year with regulatory changes as far as IRA, as well as with the CHIPS Act. That is all in front of us. Those will be nice tailwinds.\nWith a book-to-bill of 110%, we have a lot of backlog in our commercial HVAC Americas business. In Europe, just to be really blunt about it, we are winning in Europe with our innovations, and just a really strong 4Q. We had been faced with some supply chain issues there throughout 2022. A lot of those challenges improved dramatically in the 4Q. You see that with our revenue growth.\nI mean, the revenue growth in the 4Q was up, it was over 40%. Our bookings continued to be strong as they were up in the high teens, a lot of strength there. In Asia, I mean, Asia was a surprise. I mean, our revenue growth was 20%. About five points of that was kind of a hangover from the COVID problems we had in the 2Q, but still 15%, very strong. Order rates remained strong. In China specifically, our order rates were up close to double digits. Revenue was up double digits. We're cautiously optimistic on Asia as it reopens, China, that is. Thanks for the thorough answer. Lastly, could you quantify how much price you have embedded in the sales guidance this year?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gautam. This is Chris. Yeah, I think we have modest price carryover going into 2023. Certainly, we're going to be comping against tough comps in 2022 with record levels of pricing. You think about the full year 2022, we had close to 10 points of price. It's actually 9.5 points of price in the full year. Right now, we're not planning on multiple price increases in 2023, but we do remain nimble to react to how we see input costs playing out during the year. It's a strength in our business operating system. We've remained price cost positive these last two years of highly inflationary environment. We're going to remain nimble. Could it be in the 2% to 2.5% range? Yeah, that's probably the range that it's in for carryover.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThanks a lot, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Pozdrinsenski with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinskii\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Lisa, I think— Morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinskii\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys, just wondering if you can give us any detail on how you're thinking about some of the stimulus items. I think you mentioned that probably more of a second half phenomenon, so maybe more of a 2024 story. What do you think that could be worth in terms of growth? Is 2023 really just a bookings year? When you think about, Dave, that sensitivity you gave on the backlog conversion versus maybe the cushion you have on the orders front, would IRA be a potential kind of further source of cushion that you think about in that?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Nice question, Josh. I think that, first, I'll start with what we're seeing right now in stimulus. We're seeing a lot of demand, obviously, in the education vertical. If you look at our education vertical in the Americas, the equipment business in 2022, it's up close to 40%, okay? That's going to continue for some time now. I believe the change in that was if an order is booked in, I think it's September 2024, you actually have until 2026 to have it installed. We see that continuing to happen. You see that in our very, very strong absolute booking dollars that we're able to generate. IRA, obviously, that's still being worked through. The funds are going to flow from the Fed to the states, and then the states will operate in a framework, and we'll work with the different states to make sure that we're very clear on how that's going to happen.\nWe see that as that's certainly in the back half of the year, both in the commercial space, as well as in the residential space. The key to being successful, really, with IRA is how do you take something that's pretty complex right now and make it really simple for the customer? That's exactly what we did with the education funding that was available, and we'll do the same. We're really good at that with the IRA. As far as the CHIPS Act goes, yeah, that's going to be back half. I mean, that's all in front of us. It's certainly going to be an opportunity. We have a lot of strength in that vertical, and we have great customer relationships. Some of that bookings could happen in 2023, but that's really all in front of us.\nI think the applications are just being opened up here in the first quarter so that they can even start applying for these funds. That's really all in front of us, given the duration time it takes to actually get a FAD plan from planning up to operations.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinskii\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect. That's helpful. I'll leave it there.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right. Thanks, Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinskii\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Chris Snyder with UBS.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. I just wanted to start by following up on the prior commentary around some of the IRA benefits potentially coming through in the back half of the year. I mean, how do you feel about capacity and available supply to meet the expected pickup in heat pump demand into the back half?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's a great question. I think that I'll start with the supply chain. I think the supply chain continues to improve gradually. The 4Q was better than the 3Q. I'm sure the first quarter will be better than the 4Q. We see that as several quarters before the supply chain gets back to what I would call normal. As far as capacity is concerned, we don't have capacity concerns. As a company that embeds lean thinking in our operating system, we're constantly looking for ways to expand our capacity within our own four walls. We're very comfortable we'll be able to meet the demand that will happen. Hopefully, it starts to happen in the 4Q.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Appreciate that. For the follow-up, I wanted to ask on transport bookings, specifically in the Americas, which seem to drive a good chunk of the sequential slowdown. As we look forward, should we expect bookings there to pick up as the back half 2023 order book is opened up? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Chris. This is Chris. I'll start with that answer. We've been selective with opening up the backlog in our Thermo King businesses now for the last couple of years. What it means is we haven't opened up the second half of 2023 orders at this time. We are talking with customers, and we are getting strong insights from them on what units they need. We're just not pricing that at this point at the end of the 4Q, and therefore, it's not making its way into bookings and/or into backlog. For the Americas business, we're seeing the transport markets being slightly favorable, the trailer market being one to two points up on a year-to-year basis. Very solid.\nDave commented about the cadence throughout the year that may shift a little bit more into the second half, depending on how the OEMs get through their fleets and get their output up. I would tell you that really strong business. We have a lot of innovation in that business. It's a diversified business as well. While we've been able to outgrow the markets the last several years, we have those plans to do it again in 2023.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Chris, the only thing I would add is if you look at the Thermo King Americas business on a two-year stack, order rates are up over 40%. We have a very large backlog going into 2023. It's a business that has performed extremely well in 2022 and will continue to outperform the markets in 2023.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks, Dave. Good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you doing?\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Doing great. Thanks. Dave, I really liked the way you teed up the backlog discussion earlier today. I mean, there's been a lot of focus on order rates decelerating, and it seems like the trends in your business, particularly on the commercial HVAC side, remain really strong. I know it's probably too early, but as you kind of think about what's occurring today from a stimulus perspective, non-res construction, supply chain is still a bit of an issue. I mean, shouldn't your backlog exit the year well above normal levels as you kind of think about the growth rate even just beyond 2023?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think you're spot on, Joe. I think that a normal backlog for our business at the end of any year is probably in the $3 billion range. We'll end 2023 and enter 2024 with a backlog that could be $6 billion or greater. We believe our backlog will be elevated for a long period of time, which gives us a lot of visibility, not only to future revenues, but also allows us to help our suppliers and to make sure they have plenty of visibility as to what our requirements are going to be.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, that's great to hear. I guess maybe my one follow-up is really just on commercial HVAC and EMEA. That was really strong this quarter, much stronger than we anticipated. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color of what you're seeing there specifically? Is that heat pump demand? What drove the growth rate this quarter?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Joe, it's a great question. I'll tell you, I'm so proud of our team in commercial HVAC, EMEA. Yeah, we had 40% plus revenue growth in the quarter. We had some supply chain issues earlier in the year that we highlighted, okay? A lot of those, many of those, got rectified in the 4Q. That helped us get the volume out. I look at the order rates as well. The order rates are up mid-teens, two-year stack up 20. We are seeing tremendous demand for our thermal management systems. Our growth rates in Europe are really a function of our innovation that we've been able to deliver to the marketplace. We are winning share in Europe, and we are winning with our customers.\nIt's a really great story with our business in EMEA. I've been with that business for a long time. I was in the days when it was not such a great business, but it is very, very strong today. We have such a great leadership team there that's constantly pushing the envelope on innovation. Expect more in the future.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you? Good morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood. Can you just provide a little bit of color on the difference in the Americas between unitary and applied just on the revenue side, and then maybe orders as well?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Let me put my glasses on here so I can see. We were strong, really. On an equipment basis, the Americas was strong, really, in both. I mean, our unitary revenue was up north of 30%, Steve. The applied business in the Americas was mid-teens. Both very, very strong. Bookings—go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Sorry, go ahead. Bookings. Sorry about that.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nBookings were high single digits in unitary and around 30% for the applied. Very strong. Very strong results.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHow do you kind of see just the high-level profile of these businesses? You said the revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the quarter from a cadence perspective. How do you see the businesses, each of those businesses, performing just at the high level, commercial HVAC, TK, and RESI relative to the annual guidance?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYes, Steve. As we think about commercial businesses, I'll speak for Americas and EMEA, really just our plans right now up high single digits in terms of revenue on the full year. The significant backlog just gives us really strong visibility to the revenue profile. Dave's talked about the stacking effect from a bookings perspective. Could we see 10% growth in some of these businesses and pockets? Possibly. It really depends on that maturity of the supply chain, which we've seen gradually get better over the last several quarters. We've got embedded in the guide a gradual improvement in 2023. If it got stronger, could that output be stronger on the top line?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, it could be.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nLet's see how the year kind of plays out. I think for Asia, we're calling it dynamic. We're calling right now for stable growth as we work throughout the year. It's a dynamic market, and we're watching it closely, but very strong backlog entering into the year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nSorry. I meant for first—I meant for first quarter. I don't know if that's what you're talking about, just the first quarter high level on the three businesses.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would say first quarter overall in the start of the enterprise, like I mentioned earlier. I see the revenue growth in Q1 in line with how we see the full year, that 6% to 8% kind of range. Commercial HVAC, I would expect to be stronger as we work throughout the year, just given the profile. TK, we've got some backlog that's certainly carrying into the first quarter. We'll open up the bookings here for the second half shortly. I would expect that to be at the enterprise level in that 6% to 8% range. We'll see how it plays out.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGood. How are you? Dave and Chris, I know you mentioned not too much carryover pricing in 2023 and that you might not get as much deflationary benefit as you first thought, given the recent rise in commodity prices. I think just in the last couple of weeks, you've continued to raise prices. Commercial HVAC, call it mid to high single digits, and up to 10% on residential HVAC. Are the recent price increases really because commodities such as copper have been rising again lately, or should we read into the fact that demand is still quite good for Trane and so the ability to raise price is still there in 2023?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndy, I'd say it's really a mix of all the above. We are trying to get, with any luck, just one price increase as we start the year. That's been our cadence prior to the last two years of this highly inflationary environment. We're trying to set the stage for where we see pricing for the year, inclusive of how we see these commodity costs playing out over the last couple of months. The goal is we don't have three rounds of price increases as we work through 2023. Right now, it's really baking in all of that information today with that price increase entering 2023.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, and just to add to that, obviously, we are seeing—Chris talked about materials—but labor is certainly inflationary, as are energy costs. If you look at all the cost inputs, which our product growth teams look at in a lot of detail, it allows them to have visibility as to what to see in the future.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGod, it's helpful, guys. You talked about Thermo King's increasing ability to outperform its end markets. It seems like, as you talked about, you're suggesting Thermo King could grow again in 2023 despite the primary markets being flat or down. Did the secular challenges that we all know about, such as the electrification that's going on in Thermo King, raise the probability that it just becomes a lot less cyclical? As you go into a year like 2024, where ACT is talking about its forecast is down a little bit, you could still not be that cyclical or even go up in 2024.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Yeah. I mean, the cyclicality we could arm wrestle over, okay? If you look at the trailer market in the Americas, it's been in that 40,000 unit range for a long time, ±10%. Very strong market. As far as the electrification, we'll wait and see on that. I would tell you that we are—that's one of the investments that we're really doubling down on, is how do we expedite what we're doing there on electrification. We are seeing demand from our customers, especially in the shorter distances. Think of the truck aspect there. Our team's doing a great job meeting their expectations, but more to come. I'm very excited about the innovation pipeline, specifically in our Thermo King business.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research..\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Nigel. Good morning.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. I think I came on a little bit late, but I think you mentioned backlog moving down from $7 to 6 billion, still very healthy levels. I'm guessing most of that would be in commercial HVAC, but I'm just wondering how much TK would come into that backlog conversion as well. My real question here is, what is the key gating factor to an even stronger backlog conversion? I'm thinking your supply chain, construction labor, skilled labor in the fields versus maybe customers don't want the equipment today. I mean, I'm guessing they do, but what is the gating factor to getting even more backlog converted?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think you got the answer, Nigel. There's a couple of things, right? First of all, the backlog of $6 billion, I was kind of using that as an example. I think we're going to end 2023 with a backlog of $6 billion or more, okay? For us to burn $1 billion in backlog will be a lot. As far as why can't you burn it faster? A couple of reasons you hit on, right? One is supply chain. It's improving. It will continue to improve in the future. Our teams are doing just a fantastic job working with our suppliers, giving them visibility, and everything we can to make sure that we improve their performance, and that's happening.\nThe second is that lead times, especially in our commercial HVAC businesses and the applied side of it, for sure, have extended. That's not unique to Trane Technologies. That's really across the industry. In fact, we're very competitive with our lead times. That means that customers don't want to order early, right? You're not going to ship an order, especially on the applied side, to a customer before their job site is ready, and that's elongating the backlog as well.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, I was kind of hoping you might delineate between, okay, labor's a real problem, supply chain's getting better, but it's okay. On the 25% or better incremental margins for this year, I mean, that's pretty impressive when you think about commercial HVAC, outgrowing residential and TK. We've all been trained to believe that RESI, TK, better margin, commercial pucks of that business is low margin. Is that the wrong thesis, or are you absorbing mixed headwinds within that 25%+.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nNigel, it's Chris. We're aware of that thesis. I think with our focus on our business operating system, we're ensuring all of our businesses are growing margins. I would say in the commercial HVAC businesses, really been impacted the last couple of years with the supply chain challenges, lots of inefficiencies, the inability to drive productivity, lots of increased costs to serve customers, expediting freight, buying components on the spot markets. We've incurred a lot of cost in the business just to get the revenue out.\nThat's presenting a nice opportunity as the supply chain normalizes, as we can drive productivity in the plants, and ultimately get our team members focused on both productivity and solving these supply chain issues, which they've done an outstanding job solving the supply chain issues throughout the last two years. I see all of our segments next year having very strong leverage. I think there's some really nice opportunities there for us to go drive when we eliminate some of those inefficiencies.\nWe are also baking in incremental investments. I think we can do both next year. We can drive 25% or better organic leverage with also incrementally another 20 to 30 basis points of investments. It allows us to do both and really drive for market outgrowth.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNigel, just to follow up on the labor concern, that's not a concern for Trane Technologies. We've done a great job being able to attract the right labor. We're doing a great job. Our human resource department is doing just a fantastic job of training, creating career ladders for our hourly associates. We really want to be that destination location, not only for our salaried employees, but also our hourly employees. We're doing a great job there. Maybe I'll add one more thing because just our Asia business, right, is majority, call it 90%+ commercial HVAC. It's driving high teens even to margins. I think it shows that we can really drive there for our businesses globally.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, good point. Yeah. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Deane?Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane?Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Dean.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane?Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nDoing real well. Thank you. Just a lot of discussion on backlog here. Just struck me is what happens on past due? Do you have to set realistic expectations with the customers on when they'll actually get deliveries?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. That is exactly why there's elongated lead times right now. You do not want to disappoint a customer with delivery. Think about it. I mean, some of our products, we'll use air handling as an example. If you're constructing a building, you could end up holding up an entire job if you're late. Trust me, you don't want to be on the other end of a phone call that has the whole building being slowed up because of your product. We're making sure that we're providing realistic lead times to our customers.\nIt doesn't mean we don't have past dues. We do., we track that very intensely. Our plant managers drive that on a daily basis. For the most part, you really have to give realistic dates as to when a customer can expect the product, and you need to hit it. That's one of the key operational metrics that we look at at a high level. I would tell you it happens at a very detailed level within our business.\n\nDeane?Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's real helpful. As a follow-up, I was really interested in your comment just saying you're trying to avoid situations with stranded inventory. How does that happen? Any comment on the whole new SEER rollout?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It really was associated with the comment was associated with the SEER rollout, right? I think that there's a little bit more complexity this time where, depending on where you're located in the country, it's an installed date versus a manufacturing date. We really worked with our independent wholesale distributors in the south, okay, because that's really where for non-heat pump product, where that was an install date by. We didn't want them to get stranded. We helped manage that situation. We're pretty good at this. I mean, we implement so many new products that phase in, phase out, as we refer to it, is second nature to us. We just really helped our IWDs work through that process.\n\nDeane?Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Brett Lindsey with Mizuho.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHi. Good morning, all.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Brett.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, just want to come back to the transport business. You guys have been outperforming there for quite some time. Looks like 2023, you've got a lot of innovative solutions, new products coming to the market. I was hoping you could just put a finer point on the outgrowth expectation there. Then specifically on some of these new product launches, are you simply cannibalizing older equipment technology, or are you actually increasing the total addressable market with some of these electrification offerings?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nA bit of both on that. I think that you obviously are going to cannibalize any combustion engine that's out there with the electric solution, but there's also opportunities. You think about, I guess, the best example that would probably be to think of home delivery, right? I mean, it's a relatively new market, okay? It's expanding quite quickly. I think with some of our new electrified product at higher capacity, you're going to be able to create different market opportunities. I won't be more specific than that, but we're pretty excited about what we see there. Your other question was, what was? I think you came down.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nYeah. Just on the total outgrowth expectation for the year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I won't get too specific on that, but I think you could see that we've obviously taken share for the last couple of years, and we anticipate taking more share in the future, right? I mean, our team just does a great job there with working with our dealers, creating value propositions for our customer that are very compelling. I mean, I'll use Europe as an example. I mean, if you have a product that's able to get 30% better efficiency than the best in the market, you're going to have a very compelling opportunity to talk to every customer about the value proposition that we bring.\nThat's what we do. We see these innovations in Thermo King, these innovations in residential, these innovations in commercial, really hitting the mark with our customers. It really allows us to create that differentiated revenue growth that we're seeing on the top line. It's that flywheel that I referred to. We're going to continue to make sure that we save plenty of dollars to reinvest in our business to keep that flywheel very vibrant.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nYeah. Makes sense. Thanks. Just one follow-up regarding the incremental investment. Could you just spend a little more time on those priorities? I think you said factory automation. Anything on paybacks or what you think the structural benefits might be there?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start, Brent. Generally, what I'd look at is focus on our factory of the future and automation. We're spending time and cost around digital, and also around electrification that Dave spoke to specifically in not only the Thermo King portfolio, but also in our commercial HVAC portfolio as you think about electrification and heating. They're great investments to make. Some of them are driving revenues and backlogs immediately. On the automation side, the factory side, this is the opportunity for us as we see the productivity coming back into the business, and allows the features for us to go drive more of that productivity.\nWe can drive some more automation, get more volume through the factories. It's been an investment we've been working on for several years. It's also going to be a little bit of an increased investment in 2023, but very strong paybacks. Look, I think it helps contribute over the long term to that target we have of incrementals at 25% or better.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Appreciate the insight. Best of luck.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nBrett Lindsey\n\nResearch Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThanks. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks a lot for fitting me in.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem. Good morning. How are you?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. Just a question. Very interesting discussion about the fact that the industry is changing. Do you think that these extended lead times and much more visibility in the cycle is becoming more of a permanent feature of the industry because it seems you and the others are training the customers to live with the lead times, and maybe you give them some flexibility in terms of deliveries. It seems that perhaps it's a feature of the industry that's here to stay. I was wondering if we could push that discussion further. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's a provocative question, Andrew. I don't see it that way. I think that as supply chain improves, you'll see lead times contract. Does it go back to what it was post-pandemic? Maybe not. Maybe it's a little bit longer. I think that everyone sees the value in the visibility, and we've done a lot of work with our customers setting up some of those more visibility in that space. That will stay. Could they extend a bit? Sure. I expect them to improve from where they are today.\niI I went back a year, I would tell you they've dramatically improved from a year ago. We'll see how it plays out, but it's a very provocative question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Just to follow up, can you just the safety stock investment, what specific area is that related to?Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, I'll be very specific. It was very nervous about what's coming out of Asia, and so we wanted to put additional safety stock for anything that's coming out of Asia, and we think it's very prudent. It's about the $40 million range. The reopening there of China specifically, although we're cautiously optimistic, we just wanted to make sure that we were reading the tea leaves correctly and that we did not get caught short of supply. Terrific.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, everyone. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, Pat and I will be available along with Susan to take any questions that you may have in the coming days and weeks. We look forward to speaking with you then. also, we're going to be on the road quite a bit here at conferences in February and into March, and we look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Thanks and be safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Trane Technologies Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker's remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO, and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Zach, and everyone for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to slide number three. Before I dive into our quarterly results, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which is the engine behind our differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like climate change and the crucial need for climate action. Last week, the United Nations released its Emission Gap Report 2022, calling for urgent transformation to avoid climate disaster. The report cites critical actions needed, including efforts to scale zero-emission heating and cooling technologies, and to decarbonize the food supply chain. That's where Trane Technologies has a unique position to make a difference. We have the technology today to transform tomorrow. We are proud to be leading our industry with aggressive, science-based sustainability commitments, actions, and results.\nTogether with our customers, we are dramatically reducing emissions and creating sustainable homes, buildings, and cities. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation, and strong customer focus enable us to deliver a superior growth profile through cycles. This, in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our dynamic capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide number four, Q3 was another strong quarter for us across the board. Our innovation leadership continues to win customers at an unprecedented pace, and our bookings level remained extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our businesses. Organic revenues were very strong, up nearly 20%, and our book-to-bill remained over 100%, with organic bookings up 8%. Absolute demand continues to be extremely robust.\nFor perspective, year-to-date, organic bookings are 95% of our total revenues for 2021, and we still have the fourth quarter to go. Bookings continue to be particularly strong in commercial HVAC businesses globally. Our global commercial HVAC business is up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Our Americas commercial HVAC business is even stronger, up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Strong, broad-based bookings growth over the past seven quarters has driven our backlog to unprecedented levels, with a backlog of $6.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. We expect backlog to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of persistent inflation, and deliver over 10 points of incremental price and positive price versus inflation again in the third quarter.\nPricing execution is a core competency for us, and increasingly important given higher costs to serve customers across the value chain. On our second quarter earnings call, we discussed two temporary plant closures that delayed $120 million in revenue from the second quarter into the second half of 2022, with the majority of the revenues expected to be recovered in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the way our teams rose to the challenge to accelerate that recovery in the third quarter to meet or exceed our customers' needs. As a result, we successfully recovered $100 million of the $120 million in the third quarter, which is approximately $70 million ahead of our expectations, and we're on pace to deliver the additional $20 million in the fourth quarter. Our performance through the third quarter has been strong. Booking levels have remained robust, and backlog remains at unprecedented levels.\nInflation has been persistent, but our pricing execution has more than kept pace. Supply chain remains tight, but we're slowly improving. All in, we're confident in raising both our organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance above the high end of our previous ranges. When you consider that our guidance includes an additional $0.07 of headwind from FX, we're effectively raising our operational guidance for the year by about $0.15 at the midpoint. The secular megatrends underpinning our strategy are only growing stronger. Execution of our high-performance business operating system, and our unwavering focus on putting customers first, remain at the core of everything we do. Our balance sheet, liquidity position, and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provide a robust financial foundation and good optionality for capital deployment. We are well-positioned to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to thrive as conditions improve.\nPlease turn to slide number five. As I discussed on the prior slide, both bookings and revenue growth were strong and broad-based in the quarter. Americas commercial HVAC was again a standout, with organic bookings on a two-year stack up more than 50%. Continued strong bookings have driven our Americas commercial HVAC backlog to new heights, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. Commercial HVAC revenues were also strong, with low teens growth in both equipment and services. In residential HVAC, revenues were robust, up 16% in the quarter. Bookings were down 8%, consistent with our expectations, as bookings continue to normalize towards a GDP plus profile that we see for our long-term outlook. Still, our book-to-bill was 92% in the quarter, and backlog remains at historically high levels.\nWe just opened the first half of 2023 order book for our transport refrigeration Americas business in September, and bookings were strong out of the gate, up high single digits for the quarter. Growth is consistent with our expectations, as we've been working with customers on slotting throughout the year. Transport refrigeration revenues were very strong, up nearly 60%. Our team has done a terrific job of ramping up operations at the plant that was impacted by extreme weather in the second quarter and accelerating the recovery of delayed Q2 revenues into the third quarter. When we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $10 million of the $60 million in revenues in Q3, with the balance in Q4.\nThe team delivered the entire $60 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the recovery of $50 million in revenues into the third quarter and enabling us to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still extremely strong, up more than 40%. We're on pace for significant share gains in 2022, adding to strong share gains the team delivered in 2021. Turning to EMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers, despite the challenging macro backdrop. EMEA commercial HVAC orders were up low teens, and revenues were up in the mid-20s, reflecting strong demand across the portfolio, particularly for our thermal management systems, which are 3x to 4x more efficient than conventional heating and cooling.\nEMEA transport refrigeration orders declined, consistent with our expectations, mainly due to tough comps in the quarter. Additionally, we've been carefully managing our order book to mitigate inflationary impacts and therefore just opened our order book in September for the first half of 2023. Revenues were up high single digits, significantly outpacing end markets. Overall, backlog for the region remained strong, approximately 40% higher than historical norms. In Asia Pacific, commercial HVAC bookings growth continued to be strong, up low teens. The team has delivered organic bookings growth between low teens and low 20s in each of the past six quarters. Asia Pacific revenues were strong, up 28%. Similar to transport refrigeration Americas, our team has done a terrific job accelerating the recovery of delayed revenues due to a temporary plant closure from COVID-19-related lockdowns in China in the second quarter.\nWhen we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $20 million of the $60 million in delayed revenues in Q3, with the balance in Q4. The team rallied and delivered $40 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the timing of recovery of $20 million in revenues into Q3. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still strong, up mid-teens. Overall, backlog for the region remained strong, approximately 50% higher than historical norms. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenue growth was up 19%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 26%. We delivered robust enterprise growth in both equipment and services, up more than 20% and low teens, respectively. EBITDA and operating margin expansion was driven primarily by strong leverage on volume growth. Pricing remained strong, up more than 10% in the quarter, and price versus inflation was positive on a dollar basis. Productivity continues to be negatively impacted by supply chain challenges driving plant inefficiencies, as well as higher costs to serve customers. We also continue to make high levels of business reinvestment to support continued innovation and product leadership across our product portfolio. Organic leverage was strong at approximately 21%.\nPlease turn to slide number seven. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for each of the businesses earlier in the presentation, so I'll focus my comments on margins. In addition to the items discussed below, each of our segments also continued to make significant investments in our innovation pipeline to fortify our leading brands, and drive market outgrowth. In our Americas segment, we delivered solid margin expansion, driven primarily by strong incrementals on robust volume growth. Price offset inflation on a dollar basis, but remained a margin headwind. Margins were also negatively impacted by the supply chain challenges and higher costs to serve customers that I referenced earlier. In EMEA, strong volume growth with solid incrementals was more than offset by foreign exchange impacts, and continued acute supply chain challenges, which continue to have an outsized impact on productivity in the region.\nPrice versus inflation improved sequentially and was positive on a dollar basis, but remained a margin headwind. In Asia Pacific, margins expanded over 300 basis points on robust volume growth, with strong incrementals, more than offsetting FX headwinds. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. We discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for innovative products and services has never been higher, with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, strong brands with leading market positions, customer focus, and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market outgrowth over a long period of time. In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains, as demonstrated by our order growth of approximately 50% on a two-year stack. We're exiting the third quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. End markets remain strong, with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index remain favorable, with a reading of over 50 since February of 2021.\nDemand remains strong in data centers, education, healthcare, and high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long-term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization, and indoor environmental quality. We also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy-related drivers, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and education stimulus. Our commercial HVAC business has a lot of runway, and we believe we have the premier franchise to capitalize on significant opportunities that lie ahead. Demand for our residential products remained healthy, with a book-to-bill of 92%, combined with 16% revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect bookings and revenue to normalize over time, and for regulatory and policy-related tailwinds, such as the upcoming SEER change and the Inflation Reduction Act, to help buffer potential market declines.\nLonger term, we continue to see residential HVAC as a GDP plus business, which makes up about 20% of our portfolio. Turning to Americas transport refrigeration, ACC continues to project solid growth in 2022, followed by a relatively flat 2023, where the market is expected to remain at a high level. We have a diversified portfolio of solutions across a number of vertical markets, which provide opportunities and continued growth prospects through further market penetration and share gains. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP plus plus business for us. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA commercial HVAC, while we have muted expectations for overall market growth, given the volatile geopolitical backdrop, demand for our leading sustainability-focused solutions remains strong.\nWe continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth and share gains across the region, and we're seeing great traction and growth across our thermal management systems portfolio. Looking at EMEA transport refrigeration, the market is expected to be down roughly mid-single digits in 2022, primarily reflecting the removal of Russia from the market sizing. Looking out to 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly, reflecting economic uncertainty in the region. We're continuing to work closely with our customers as the market evolves. Turning to Asia, we continue to see strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare verticals. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with varying dynamics country to country. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. As Dave discussed at the outset of the call, we are pleased with our execution through the first three quarters of the year, and we continue to see slow but steady improvement in our supply chain. Additionally, bookings and backlog continue at high levels, providing us with good visibility into future revenues. All in, we're confident in once again raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance for 2022. We are raising our full-year organic revenue growth guidance to between 13% to 14%, up from our prior guidance of 12%, reflecting both stronger price and volume for the year. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.15 to $7.20, from a range of $7.05 to $7.15, which is an increase of about $0.07 at the midpoint.\nAs Dave mentioned previously, our updated guidance includes an additional $0.07 headwind from FX for the year that we are absorbing in our guidance, which means our core guidance range is effectively higher by about $0.14 to $0.15 at the midpoint. Our full-year organic leverage expectations are unchanged at mid-teens. While we continue to see our supply chain slowly improving, it remains challenging and continues to pressure productivity in our plants, and drive higher costs to serve customers, as we've discussed previously. As a result, we're expecting similar to modestly improved leverage in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, or between 20% to 25%. We expect free cash flow to remain healthy, and we're targeting 100% of adjusted net income for the year.\nDependent upon the timing of revenue and shipments as we close out the year, we could see some receivables carry over into 2023, which could modestly impact the timing of our cash conversion. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged. One last item I wanted to highlight relates to our guidance cadence. As Dave discussed earlier, when we raised our guidance on our second quarter call, we envisioned recouping about $30 million of the $120 million in delayed revenues related to the second quarter plant closures in the third quarter, and recouping the other $90 million in revenues in the fourth quarter. We're extremely pleased we were able to accelerate this recovery plan and recoup $100 million in revenues in the third quarter, $70 million ahead of our guidance expectations.\nThe net effect is a modest shift in the timing of $70 million in revenues, or approximately $0.07 of adjusted EPS into the third quarter from the fourth quarter, with no impact to the full year. Please see page 17 of the presentation, which provides additional details related to guidance to assist with your models. Please go to slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings in high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. It's important to note that our transformation savings program is a discrete program related to recovering 3x the amount of stranded costs we expected to see as a result of the separation of our industrials business.\nOur business operating system is designed to drive continued strong productivity and cost savings over the long term, and we have a long track record of success over the past 10+ years. Our relentless focus on executing our business operating system and driving productivity and cost savings continues long after the discreet transformation program has achieved its targets. Please go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nOur balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the third quarter, we deployed $406 million in cash, with $156 million to dividends, and $250 million to share repurchases. Year-to-date through October, the company has deployed approximately $1.6 billion, with $900 million to share repurchases, $467 million to dividends, and approximately $250 million to M&A, including the acquisition of Alco Air Technology, which closed on Monday, 31 October 2022. We continue to target the deployment of approximately $2.5 billion of capital in 2022. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have significant firepower for share repurchases, with approximately $3.5 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations.\nOur strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 14. Overall, global transport refrigeration markets are expected to remain healthy in 2022. Forecasts for 2022 are largely unchanged versus the last quarter, with strong growth in North America, and a mid-single digit decline in EMEA, largely driven by the removal of Russia from the market sizing. For 2023, forecasts have softened a bit versus the prior quarter. ACC is now projecting roughly flat growth from 2022 to 2023, with the overall market remaining at a high level. In EMEA, while IHS has yet to publish an official outlook for 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly based on a softening European economic backdrop. After clear share gains in truck, trailer, and APU in both the Americas and EMEA in 2021, we're expecting continued share gains in 2022.\nFor 2023, we have strong and diversified portfolios in both North America and EMEA, and see opportunities for growth and share gains across our portfolio. Please go to slide number 15. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify and create record levels of demand for our innovative products and services. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging, uplifting culture. The strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team, and our broad-based market demand give us confidence in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guide. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team, and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2022 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns.\nWe'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question on the phone lines today, please press star one on your telephone keypad. To remove yourself from the queue, you can press star one again. Once again, everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, guys. Nice quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How you doing?\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGood. Dave, can you give us more color into the commercial HVAC bookings environment in the Americas? It looks like your bookings actually accelerated a bit in Q3. Could you talk about the biggest drivers of that bookings growth at this point, the visibility of continued strong bookings? How much of the good growth is the impact from institutional customers, maybe starting to reach day-two spend in IAQ? Have you seen any customers begin to pull back on spend yet? Are you seeing any major differences between applied and unitary?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, we haven't seen any pullback, Andy. Good question. We're seeing broad-based demand: electronics, data centers, education, healthcare, high-tech industrial. Think of electronics, EV plants, battery plants. We're seeing some nice demand. I mean, our order rates were up around 20% in the Americas, and it's really across many verticals. A lot of strength there.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Maybe a similar question on RESI. I know you don't want to give us exact forecasts for 2023, but bookings down high single digits in line with what you guys thought, but pricing is still very strong. Have you seen any weakness in replacement volume at this point? You kind of said that you didn't expect it to fall off a cliff. How's that going? What about inventory in the channel? Are you still measuring your RESI backlog in months that gives you decent visibility, especially with SEER change in 2023?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Our RESI business had a very strong third quarter with strong mid-teens organic revenue growth. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 92%. Channel inventory in our independent wholesale distributor channel was a bit higher than normal, but nothing alarming. Sell-through in the independent channel was mid-teens, so it was strong. Order rates will be under pressure here in the short term as we think about this backlog that we're still measuring in months as it starts to normalize. Andy, if you remember, in 2021, our order rates for our RESI business on a full-year basis were up around 30%, and our revenue was up like 14%. We built this really large backlog that we'll need to process through. You really need to look at, when you think about residential, you really need to look at three different elements. One is, what's your order rate?\nTwo is, what's your backlog? Obviously, your revenue. Those three will start to neutralize themselves over time. Longer term, we see our residential business as a GDP-plus business, and they had a very strong third quarter for us.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAndy, I'll add on the enterprise backlog. We reported a $6.4 billion. We still see that 90% is non-residential. It's focused on our commercial businesses, including thermal chain. It still stayed the same here in the third quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAndy, we do not see RESI falling off a cliff. There's going to be some positive tailwinds, too, next year. You have the SEER change that will happen, which will drive some price. You also have IRA, which we're still working through. There are some elements there that still need to be defined, but that will be a tailwind. Hopefully, that starts towards the beginning of the second quarter. There is some positive, too, in residential.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, thanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, good morning, and congrats on the nice quarter.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, John. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nI'm going to take a stab at it. You have incredibly strong backlog. You've opened up the order book at Thermo King. Services continues to grow nice. Just anything you can give us in terms of maybe how you think the market develops into 2023, or just how much more visibility you have today than you would normally have going into a year?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, I think with a backlog of $6.4 billion, it gives us a lot of visibility. If you think about a normal fiscal year, John, we typically go in with about 20% of our revenue in the backlog. Obviously, we're going to go into 2023 with a much larger number, which really is going to help us, too, with our forecasting capability with our suppliers. The supply base is still constrained. It's improving. The third quarter was certainly better than the second quarter. The fourth quarter will be better than the third quarter. It is going to be constrained for a period of time. Having that visibility really helps us, helps our suppliers, helps us with our forecasting capability.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Maybe just on the margin, price cost still positive on absolute dollars. I think you said it's still a headwind to the margin. Just as you think about price flowing into next year, maybe also what you're seeing on inflation, just maybe give us some expectations for price cost and when it flips positive on a margin percent.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, John, you summarized it well. The third quarter price cost positive on a dollar basis, still a margin headwind, but less of a margin headwind in Q3 than what we saw in Q2. It is getting a little bit better. As we think about 2023, we'll certainly see some carryover price coming into next year. We're seeing those commodities start to come down off of their peaks. Certainly not back where we were two years ago in terms of commodity costs, but a little bit of deflation there. We see that impacting 2023 more so than 2022. We also are looking at items like wage inflation and energy inflation as well that we'll need to bundle all together, and we'll provide a better look on 2023 in a few months when we report our Q4 earnings. There should be some deflationary opportunities in there.\nWe're going to have, as Dave mentioned, a very strong backlog entering into 2023. Ultimately, the goal here is to deliver top quartile results.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat, thank you. I'll pass it along.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How you doing?\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nGood. Good, thank you. Guys, if you think back to kind of prior housing recessions, we saw a bit of a double mix shift, a mix shift down to lower-end units, and a mix shift towards more repair versus replace. Given the SEER changes that are coming in in 2023 and perhaps maybe change in kind of how dealers have taken inventory and stuff, do you see a similar potential or a muted impact? It sounds from your prepared remarks like perhaps a more muted impact, but maybe some color on why would be helpful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I think it will be a little bit more muted. I think that there's obviously the SEER change, which we are in the process, obviously, of shipping the new products as we speak. That's going to add some price. It's also going to push up the higher end of the SEERs market. I also think that IRA will be a tailwind. Again, we're working through some of the details on that that still need to be defined, but that will certainly push the market more to the heat pump side of things, and the higher SEERs on the heat pumps.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay, switching gears, I see in your releases, press releases, plus trade magazines, the next generation of products and Thermo King. Where is that mark? I mean, help us understand the demand from the customer for next generation product. In particular, really, where is that technology going? Is it going to a hybrid or all battery? When, I suppose, is another way to.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood question. We don't have totally the crystal balls there, but I would tell you that it is moving to electrification. You're seeing it in the smaller vehicles now, and we have a complete portfolio of products there that are able to capture that market. On the long-haul carriers, so think about the reefer units, that'll be a slower transition, but we're ready for it. We actually have products that are out now. We're testing in the field with customers that are fully electric. It'll take an approach very similar probably to what you've seen with cars, where you'll start with hybrid, and then it will move to an all-electric version.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay, best of luck. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Just want to...\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Just wanted to start with the Thermo King outlook. You have that very helpful slide 14. When we're thinking about next year, it looks like, as you said, the sort of third-party market forecast and so forth of the sort of flat to down units in 2023. I just wondered about how you would frame the scope for Thermo King or overall transport at Trane to do better than that. What's the outlook for that 1/3 of revenue, which is marine, bus, rail, and aftermarket? How is pricing in transport for you versus the Trane enterprise? Any thoughts on share gain potential, perhaps after some undergrowth in North America this year? Any color on that, please?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would say that our Thermo King business, I'll start in the Americas. It's performed very well for a number of quarters consecutively. Very strong quarter, obviously, in third quarter as we saw the revenue that we missed in Q2. The team was able to pick that up in Q3. Just a great effort there by that team. As far as share gains, we're very happy with our share gains in our Thermo King business. Outlook for 2023, we like the innovation that we've been able to drive in that business in really both regions, both in EMEA and in the Americas. It's really helping us with our share position. 2023 in the Americas, yeah, ACT has got it relatively flat to 2022, but understand that's at a very, very high level.\nI mean, they're forecasting the trailer market to be the last number I saw was like 45,000, which is a very, very robust market. In Europe, we haven't seen an official forecast from IHS. We're estimating that it's going to be down modestly, but don't assume that that means that our business will be down. Okay? We have some great innovations there, and we continue to get traction with some of the innovations that we've had in our EMEA business.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nDave, maybe just one follow-up on that. The pricing in transport, how do we think about that versus the Trane enterprise average of, I think, 10 points?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Julian, I'll jump in. We don't really dial it in necessarily by each SVU, but I would say it's certainly contributing to the enterprise performance. The business operating system that's been deployed for many years, one aspect of that is pricing and getting in front of inflation. The Thermo King team is really a part of that strength that we've shown over the last seven quarters in this highly inflationary environment and staying ahead on price cost. Really proud of where our teams both in Americas, in Europe, and in Asia Pacific have dealt there. Julian, if I could just follow up on just a quick story here to talk a little bit about our culture here at Trane Technologies.\nThat team in the Americas overcame a massive obstacle that happened in the early May time period when a tornado hit our facility in Puerto Rico and really removed the roof from one of our major assembly operations there. I can remember meeting with that leadership team, and it was early May. The president of that business, she walked into the room, and she looked at the team, and she had three questions for the team. She said, number one, are all our employees safe? The answer was yes, because the storm hit on a Sunday afternoon, and the plant was unoccupied. The second was, do any of our team members need help? The answer was no, because as tornadoes are, they tend to be very targeted, and it was not a large impact to the community.\nThe third question was, how do we get this facility back up and running so we could take care of our customers? Here we are talking about this in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, and we were able to recover all of the missed revenue that happened in the second quarter and the third quarter. That team performed exceptionally well, and it just speaks volumes to the character of not only that team, but of Trane Technologies.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThat's good to hear, Dave. Maybe just switching tack for a second, operating leverage, Chris, you called out 20% to 25% for Q4. When we look at this sort of broadly, the next 12 months, do we assume that number lifts gradually as you get this kind of steady abatement of price cost and supply chain margin headwinds? There's no kind of step change, but it should clearly move higher from Q4.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would say, Julian, the direction where commodities are going would suggest there should be certainly some improvement. We've done some great work staying ahead on price and keeping them ahead of inflation. I think that is an opportunity going into next year, that price versus direct material cost inflation. We are looking at areas such as wage inflation and energy inflation as well, that have to be factored in. We'll provide more guidance on that in a few months. We're also going to be, right now, we're in the middle of that planning process for next year. We're really spending a lot of time around our investments again, and where can we accelerate some of those investments to really drive returns? All of that's going to be baked in as we think about incrementals for next year.\nA lot of moving components as always, but we'll give you guidance in a few months.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Julian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Joe. How are you? Doing great, Dave. Seems like you guys are doing well as well, thanks for asking. Just going to maybe just starting off with the EMEA, maybe just parse out a little bit what's happening here on the margins. You're clearly, I'm assuming, FX, price cost having an impact. It's been down now for four quarters in a row. I'm just wondering, at what point do we start to see an improvement in the margin profile for the EMEA business?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Joe. Think of that FX decline on a year-over-year basis. About half of that is coming from foreign currency, and the other half of that is still these acute supply chain issues that, frankly, we saw in that region starting about a year ago with the significant demand. We're still incurring higher costs to serve customers, which we know is the right thing to do in this market. Both those costs, the supply chain inefficiencies, which are still very real, and then foreign currency are really the drivers for margin. We do expect those margins to improve over time as these supply chain challenges improve. Dave's talked about this gradual recovery, and we've seen that occur in the third quarter with some stronger volumes than what we had forecasted. We do see that gradually getting better as we move out over the next several quarters.\nIt's going to take some time. Yeah, Joe. The other thing I would add is I'm very confident long-term with our outlook in Europe. That region continues to grow share, and it is one of our leading regions with innovation. Just a really creative management team there that's been able to execute well. Long-term, I feel good about Europe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, I guess maybe part of my question, I should have asked it earlier, is are you starting to see any impact from European energy costs? Is that impacting the margin at all? Just any color around that would be helpful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'd say maybe a little bit in the third quarter. I mean, certainly, as we talk to our employees, they're feeling the impact of that in their own utility bills and the statements that they're getting at home. Yes, it is starting to creep in a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit into the fourth quarter, and certainly into next year, maybe a bigger dollar amount for us to kind of consider and think about from a pricing perspective. I think what it's also doing is driving a fair amount of the order growth, as well, as you think about products that are in the Thermo King space, hybrid electric products that have 30% fuel savings versus a product that was on the market two years ago.\nThe electrification of heating and driving our thermal management systems on the commercial HVAC side, the reduced energy intensity, those are really contributing as well in this very challenging energy crisis in Europe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's helpful. If I could just maybe sneak one more in just on Rezi, can you parse out just how much of the growth this quarter was price versus volumes, and whether there's been any discernible difference between what you're selling through your own network versus what you're selling through independent distribution?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think the simple answer there is everything was up mid-teens. That makes it easy, the answer. I mean, for the enterprise, we had over 10 points of price, and Rezi continues to be one of our leading businesses with price. It is north of 10. We will not go any further than that for competitive reasons, but it is a strong business, had a good, strong third quarter.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, thanks, Joe. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nGood morning. Nice quarter, guys. Thanks. Appreciate it, guys.\nYeah, just to follow up on the last question on Rezi, I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of double ordering, pushback, where maybe as lead times come in, you're getting cancellations or anything of that sort? I'm curious, just you haven't given guidance for next year, but do you think Rezi profits can actually be up next year with volumes down, some unquantified level? If so, kind of why?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start. I'll let Chris talk about the profit next year, but we're not seeing any cancellations. Okay? That's not happening. If I look at the inventory in the channel, as I said earlier, it's a bit higher than we would normally see, but nothing alarming. We haven't seen any cancellations. I do believe that we will see our order rates on a unit basis continue to come down because we have to process through this backlog that is, we're still measuring it in months, and it's going to take several quarters before we're able to process that down.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would add on the margins, as we've said, the residential businesses really had some very strong price over the last seven quarters. At the same time, stayed ahead of inflation.\nAs we go into our planning process, we look at all of our strategic business units, and we think about top-line growth, leverage growth, your cash flow performance across the board. I think the team has executed quite well with investments they've made over several years in the value space. That's a market that continues to grow well for that SVU. Depending on how markets move in the US, that's an area that 10 years ago, we didn't have very much of a presence in the value channel. That's an area we do have a presence in today. On the replacement side versus repair, we'll see where that plays out, but it's a business that has a great sense of purpose as well as brands. I've said this before, but we don't see the residential business falling off a cliff next year.\nWe don't see margin contraction or large revenue falloffs.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you? Good morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood. Is the mix of your Rezi business with furnaces about in line with the industry? Call it like 30% or something like that?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I know that it's a good question, Steve. I don't have that in front of me. I would tell you that I know that our mix of heat pumps is stronger than the industry. Obviously, you don't have a furnace with a heat pump, but I don't have the specifics on heat pumps when we're selling split systems.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Okay. Just on the commercial side, I think you guys put through a pretty dramatic price increase in the third quarter on light commercial. We're continuing to hear about extended lead times there. Can you just talk about maybe what kind of behavior you saw around that price increase, or if I'm wrong about that? Are you guys seeing longer than normal lead times on the light commercial side?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYes, Steve. I'll start with pricing. The latest part of our business operating system is to evaluate the input costs, and then ultimately making sure we're pricing based on value as well. I'd say across the majority of our businesses in 2022, we've seen actually three rounds of price increases, very similar to the three rounds we saw in 2021. I think the team is looking at significant demand, making sure we're pricing for it. A number of these products are getting delivered three, six, nine months out. We want to make sure we're protecting ourselves from an inflation perspective on the cost side. As far as lead times go, Steve, we have extended lead times across our portfolio, as does the broader industry, as do most industrials right now, as we're still working through the supply chain challenges that are improving.\nAs far as on the unitary side, actually, we're doing pretty well there. I don't see that. That's not an area that we have. I would imagine that we're very competitive in the marketplace there.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nWhat was your commercial unitary order up in the quarter? That's my last question. Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOrders in, I'm sorry, in unitary or?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nCommercial unitary. Yeah, commercial unitary equipment.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI don't know. I know our revenue was up in the 20s. I don't know what the order rate was. We'll get back to you on that on the after call.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just touching very quickly. Good morning, Dave. Just quickly on the unitary versus applied mix. Obviously, lots of questions about the macro. The applied large commercial feels like it's got a lot of sack with tailwinds, and it has. Would you say unitary still has a bit more fatality risk than applied? Just a quick question there. Really, my question is really around the services. Low teens in the Americas and EMEA, really impressive. I think over time, it's grown 70%. Is the delta between trend and now mainly price, or is this IAQ and other things that's driving that growth rate? Kind of how do you think that trends in 2023?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think if you look longer term at our service business, and let's look over a five-year period here on a global basis, our service business is up on a compound annual growth rate, high single digits. That's a business that's very resilient, that's performed very well for us. In fact, in 2020, the pandemic year, we were flat to 2019 despite having lockdowns and having difficulty accessing some buildings. Service business is a great business. We have a great operating system around our service business. Today, it represents close to 1/3 of Trane Technologies. We're very happy with our service business. On the unitary side, we had strong growth throughout our Commercial HVAC business. It was broad-based in unitary and in applied. Really broad-based in many verticals across the globe.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's great. My follow-on is really a quick one on supply chain. One of the companies this morning surprised on supply chain availability issues in the current quarter relative to last quarter. It feels like most companies are talking about supply chains slightly improving. I'm just wondering how you characterize the momentum in your kind of in the hard-to-get components.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Yeah. I'd say supply chain performed as expected during the third quarter. We anticipate a gradual improvement through the rest of the year and for several quarters into 2023. Our team is doing just a great job of managing that. I think this large backlog gives us more visibility, as we talked about earlier, which, again, being able to tell our suppliers what we need is very important, and being accurate with that. Our team's just done a fantastic job there. Supply chain's improving slowly, slower than any of us want. We'll continue to see improvement in the fourth quarter here.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks, Dave.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nHey, I'm doing great. Thanks. Hey, just a couple of loose ends. First, Chris, just back on Europe margins and FX. I typically think of FX, right, being a profit headwind, but not a margin headwind. Is there some particular transactional issue going on in Europe beyond just kind of translation effect of dollar strength?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJeff, it's a good question. Not all the components, raw material purchases in Europe are all denominated in euros. There are certainly components that come in from the US or from Asia. There are some transactional headwinds here when you think about the declining euro against the dollar. That's part of the driver. I totally understand your question, it is that dynamic of some of the components we buy in currencies other than the euro.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nI was wondering also if you guys could kind of take a swag at measuring kind of the productivity headwinds you've absorbed here over the last, whether it's the year to date or since we got into this whole kind of tangled supply chain mess. How significant have they been to margins in aggregate, and just your thought process on being able to reverse some of that as we maybe perhaps get into the second half of 2023? Yeah. I think one of the knock-on effects of a supply chain that's inconsistent is productivity, right?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIf you think about if you're running a factory and you don't have the right components, you're stopping lines, you're partially building product, you're putting it out in the yard, you're bringing it back on the line when you get the components to retest the product because obviously we want to test everything before it gets shipped out to a customer. It's been disruptive. It's improving, but it's going to improve slowly as the supply chain improves. As far as qualifying it, it's difficult to do right now. I would just tell you that it's going to be slowly improving, and we'll continue to make progress. It's certainly a focus of our teams as to how do we get back to being able to have the productivity we've seen in the past.\nThe supply chain, the knock-on effect associated with it, it has had an impact in our operations, for sure.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nI'm sorry. Just a related follow-up to that, Dave. If supply chain got better more quickly than expected, do you think you could actually accelerate backlog conversion, or the customer at the job site still is not ready, that there really isn't scope to dramatically accelerate backlog conversion?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I think that we're obviously getting with extended lead times. I think the first thing you're going to see as the supply chain improves, you'll see those lead times start to contract back to more of a normal level. Right now, we're obviously, especially on applied jobs, those are specific to a job site, and they're giving us enough leadway so we're able to hit their expectations. It's very difficult to accelerate that on the applied side unless the job site suddenly gets pulled forward, which happens, but I wouldn't say we're seeing that as the norm right now.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay, thanks, James.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Dean.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey. I'm not sure how specific you can get here, but at the outset of the call, you talked about market share gains in virtually all businesses. If we think about that 9% in volume growth, how much of that might be attributed to share? Again, it's harder at a total company level versus the business unit, but if any color there would be helpful.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it is. I think when you start talking averages and you start getting share up to a company level, it's not meaningful. I would tell you that if you look around the different regions, we like the growth rates we're seeing, we like the innovations we've been able to drive, and we certainly like the order rates that we're seeing. You could see that with our order rates versus maybe some other companies. We're very happy with the performance. We're very happy with our product management teams being able to really understand customers' insights and being able to have innovations that exceed their expectations. Expect that to continue in the future. One of the things that we pride ourselves in is the fact that we don't let up on innovation. We don't let up on the dollars that we invest in innovation.\nYou're going to continue to see that from Trane Technologies well into the future.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate that. Just as a follow-up on any update on indoor air quality healthy buildings initiative, you all had kind of drawn the line in the sand and said it would be a 200 basis point lift for 10 years or so. Where does that stand?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, go ahead, Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Japan, yeah. We quantified it last year, Dean, as a 2-point lift on revenues. As we moved through the year last year, we just found it was really hard to start bifurcating what was an indoor air quality order versus maybe a traditional equipment order or a service order. It certainly helped contribute to the growth last year. As we're seeing significant growth this year, it took the full-year guide up 13% to 14% organic growth on the full year. Indoor air quality is one of those contributors to customers looking at upgrading their equipment, getting energy savings right earlier, especially where we see energy prices right now. It certainly is a contributor in the remaining tailwind.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nChair and CEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. One of the areas Deane just talked a little bit about is in the education vertical. I know the funding there with ESSER. Our education vertical in North America, order rates are up year to date over 40%. Over 40%. You could see the traction that we're having there.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's real helpful, thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Joe O’Dea with Wells Fargo.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you? Good morning.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nDoing well. Thanks. I wanted to ask on COGS, just thinking about some of the cost dynamics moving forward. If you can talk about, within the materials exposure, how much materials is of COGS, how much of that is raws versus source components, and what do you think about those cost trends? Should we see a smoother supply chain and lower raws contribute to lower component costs as well, or does strong demand not translate to lower component costs, just to kind of understand some of those moving pieces?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's certainly, I guess, all of the above in a mix. We're going to look as we go into guidance for next year, trying to just give an update of the componentry of commodity costs versus other costs, because that has kind of changed over time. We've described between copper, aluminum, and steel, those being each about 1/3 of total what I call tier one commodity costs, excluding, say, refrigerants. Certainly, as I said before, it provides a bit of a tailwind going into next year in terms of where we see those commodity costs going right now. Certainly, with more volume, there generally is a bit more leverage we can try to get. In this supply chain environment and the constraints, we're ultimately just trying to manage that quarter to quarter and continue to see that getting better.\nI guess I'd leave it at that kind of level as we kind of ultimately look to price for next year and ultimately try to get a price-cost positive spread for next year.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Back to the sort of price-cost margin dynamic, just based on the visibility that you have, when do you see that flipping such that you're positive on the margin side from a price-cost angle?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I expect for the fourth quarter to remain price-cost positive on a dollar basis. I think it'll still be margin decremental on a year-over-year basis. That price component, though, of the growth in the fourth quarter, that'll be lower than the third quarter. We're just comping against stronger price realization from a year ago. Certainly, second half of 2021, much stronger than the first half. I do expect top-line price to be less of a contributor in Q4. We're on track to be price-cost positive for the full year. Ultimately, for the full year, it'll be a bit of a margin headwind as well.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be around to take any questions that you might have in the coming days and weeks. Hopefully, we'll see you on the road soon. Everyone, have a great day. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q2 2022 Trane Technologies PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2022 Trane Technologies PLC Earnings Call\n\nTTNYSEAUG 3, 10:00 AM\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe absolute booking levels we've delivered over the past year and a half have been extraordinary and have been broad-based across our portfolio. Last quarter, I discussed the natural tendency to focus on bookings' growth trends, but growth trends may be misleading when the absolute number moves step functions higher than any historical reference period, as they did in 2021.\nI encourage investors to consider absolute bookings and backlog in addition to bookings' growth to get a fuller picture. Even with our robust organic revenue growth of 11% in Q2, absolute bookings exceeded revenues with a strong book-to-bill of 111%, and our backlog grew more than $300 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2. These results are even stronger when you consider that we are constraining bookings in our transport refrigeration business to help mitigate inflationary risks.\nAbsolute bookings levels and backlog provide us good visibility into future revenues, particularly in our non-residential businesses. Our non-residential businesses represent roughly 80% of our total revenue, and closer to 90% of our total backlog, and tend to be longer cycle. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of persistent inflation and deliver over 10 points of price and positive price versus inflation again in the second quarter.\nThis is a core competency for us, and increasingly important given higher costs to serve customers across the value chain. I'm especially proud of our team's performance given two temporary plant closures we overcame in the quarter. We discussed the China COVID lockdowns on our first quarter call and our expectation to make this up in the second half, which is still the case.\nOur teams managed to minimize the revenue impact to approximately $60 million, better than the $80 to 100 million range we anticipated at the time the lockdowns occurred. We also overcame a tornado that temporarily knocked out production at one of our North America transport refrigeration facilities in the quarter. The revenue impact to the quarter was also approximately $60 million.\nWe expect to recoup the full impact in the second half of the year. We exited the quarter with both plants fully back up and running. Our performance through the first half of the year has been stronger than we originally anticipated. Booking levels have remained robust, backlog is significantly higher, inflation has been persistent, but our pricing execution has more than kept pace. Supply chains remain tight, but we have seen some improvement and believe we have line-of-sight to further improvement in the second half of the year.\nAll in, we're confident in raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.05 to 7.15. When you consider that our guidance includes an additional $0.06 headwind from FX, partially offset by a $0.01 tailwind from M&A, we're effectively raising our operational guidance by $0.10. The secular megatrends underpinning our strategy are only growing stronger. Execution of our high-performance business operating system, and our unwavering focus on putting customers first, remain at the core of everything we do.\nOur balance sheet, liquidity position, and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provide a robust financial foundation and good optionality for capital deployment. We are exceptionally well-positioned to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to thrive as conditions improve. Please turn to slide number five.\nAs I discussed on the prior slide, we delivered the strongest booking quarter in our history in Q2, and the bookings' growth was broad-based. Demand in our Americas commercial HVAC business continues to top records, and bookings were up mid-teens. Two-year stack bookings were up approximately 45%. Backlog is extremely strong, up over 70% year-over-year. Commercial HVAC revenues were strong, up high-single-digits, with growth across equipment and services.\nIn residential HVAC, bookings were down mid-single-digits versus a high 30s prior-year comp. Absolute booking levels were resilient, with 101% book-to-bill, despite strong revenue growth. Transport Americas bookings were healthy, up low teens, despite the fact that we are constraining bookings to mitigate inflationary risks. Non-constrained demand would be much stronger, but customers understand the dynamic and are working closely with us on slots.\nRevenues were down low-single-digits against a tough prior-year comp, up nearly 70%, and were impacted by the extreme weather event I referenced earlier. This effectively shifted revenue from Q2 to the second half, mainly to Q4. Turning to EMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. EMEA commercial HVAC orders continue to be strong, up low teens, and revenues were up high-single-digits.\nAs expected, transport bookings were down, in part due to tough prior-year comps, and similar to our Americas transport business, we continue to constrain bookings through our order book to help mitigate inflationary risks. Revenues were up low teens, outpacing end markets. Our Asia-Pacific team delivered commercial HVAC bookings growth in the high teens, and revenues were down due to COVID lockdowns in China, as discussed. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. Organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter was strong, despite the volume impacts from China's COVID lockdowns and the temporary plant shutdown related to extreme weather in Transport Americas that Dave mentioned earlier. FX was about a 2% headwind. Pricing was strong, up more than 10%, comprising the majority of the revenue growth this quarter.\nPrice versus inflation was positive on a dollar basis, and improved from the first quarter, but was still a margin headwind in the quarter. Productivity, mix, and lower corporate expenses were favorable, and we continue to make incremental business reinvestments to support innovation in the quarter. Organic leverage was solid at approximately 16%. All in, Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins declined 40 and 20 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EPS grew 13%, driven primarily from strong operating performance and higher adjusted operating income.\nPlease turn to slide number seven. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for each of the businesses earlier in the presentation, so I'll focus my comments on margins. Each of the businesses was heavily impacted by continued supply chain challenges and associated inefficiencies across our operations. In the near-term, we are incurring higher costs to serve customers across the value chain, including significant investments in spot buys and expedited freight.\nEach segment also continued to make significant investments in our strong innovation pipeline. Our Americas segment delivered strong price, which offset inflation on a dollar basis, and modest volume growth with strong incrementals and solid productivity, leading to a modest decline in margins. In EMEA, price was offset by inflation on a dollar basis, negatively impacting margins.\nAcute supply chain challenges are having an outsized impact on productivity in the region and are expected to improve as we move through the second half, as is price versus inflation. In Asia-Pacific, lower margins were primarily the result of lower revenues, which delivered at roughly the region's gross margin rate, consistent with our expectations. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. As we've discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher, with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, franchise brands with leading market positions, customer focus, and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market-out growth over a long period of time.\nIn North America, our commercial HVAC business is driving record demand and share gains, demonstrated by our order growth of approximately 45% on a two-year stack. We're exiting the second quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than double historical norms. Markets remain strong, with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February 2021, remain favorable.\nDemand remains strong in data centers, education, and healthcare. Every day, we see customers establishing their own sustainability targets, and we're partnering with them to create decarbonization roadmaps to achieve their targets through our customized system-based approach. We're helping our K-12 customers deploy federal stimulus funds to improve the indoor air quality of schools.\nWe see both decarbonization and indoor air quality as multi-year tailwinds for our business, given our deep customer relationships and expertise. Demand for our residential products remains strong, with a book-to-bill of 101%, despite strong revenue growth. Turning to Americas transport refrigeration, ACT projects continued market growth through 2023. We'll talk more about transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of intersection.\nTurning to EMEA, while we have muted expectations for market growth, with a volatile geopolitical backdrop continuing, demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remains strong, and we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth and share gains. Turning to Asia, we are monitoring the COVID lockdowns in China and their broader impact on the region. The business is healthy, with strong bookings growth in the second quarter. Potential geopolitical and COVID-related risks have proven hard to predict for the region.\nFor the year, we continue to see underlying strength in China's data center, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare markets. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with COVID-related lockdowns still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales model is differentiated in the region and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in both equipment and services. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our updated full-year guidance. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. As Dave discussed at the outset of the call, we are pleased with our first-half performance. In our second-half outlook, strong backlog and pricing execution gives us confidence to raise our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We are raising our full-year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 12%, up from our prior guidance of 10%.\nWe're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.05 to $7.15, which is higher by $0.05 at the midpoint. As Dave mentioned previously, this is $0.10 higher when you factor in the negative impact of FX, partially offset by M&A. We continue to expect a stronger second half on revenue growth and leverage versus the first half, with an improving supply chain and product redesigns coming online that will help us serve our customers better and provide added resiliency to our supply chain.\nOrganic leverage for the third quarter is expected to be similar to Q2, or around mid-teens. We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Our outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues across high ROI projects, in support of our profitable growth objectives and our sustainability commitments.\nThese high ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency, as well as investments to further decarbonize our operations. Our free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with a particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth. Please turn to slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio.\nPlease go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve.\nThird, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the second quarter, we deployed $565 million in cash, with $155 million to dividends, $110 million for M&A, and $300 million to share repurchases.\nYear-to-date, the company has deployed approximately $1.1 billion, of which $650 million was for share repurchases, and we have approximately $3.7 billion remaining under current authorizations. We expect to continue to pay a competitive and growing dividend, and to deploy 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time. Turning to M&A, we completed a small channel acquisition in April, and our M&A pipeline remains active.\nAll in, we are on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2022, inclusive of $1.9 billion between M&A and share repurchases. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Thanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 14.\nOverall, global transport refrigeration markets are expected to remain healthy in 2022. In North America, ACT has raised their 2022 forecast modestly, primarily reflecting actual bills coming in a bit stronger than expected in the first half. On balance, 2022 weighted average growth is expected to be up 10% versus up 8% prior. Growth is expected for 2023 as well. Overall, the forecast for EMEA markets is relatively unchanged.\nThe total market size has dropped year-over-year to reflect the removal of the Russian market. Russia comprises about 14% of the EMEA market for trailers and trucks. Effectively removing Russia from the total available market for three quarters of 2022 lowers the market size for trailers and trucks by approximately 11% and the weighted average market size by approximately 6% for the year. While the reduction in the total available market will impact our EMEA business growth in 2022, we continue to expect to drive growth through share gains and strong price realization across the region.\nAfter clear share gains in truck, trailer, and APU in both the Americas and EMEA in 2021, we're expecting global outgrowth and continued share gains in 2022 as well. Please turn to slide number 15. We've updated the North America ACT trailer market growth outlook slide and added the 2024 forecast for reference.\nYou can see that ACT continues to call for a 10-year average for North America trailers in the mid-40,000 unit range, with growth through 2023 and a modest step down in 2024. IHS has not updated its outlook for EMEA beyond 2022 at this stage. Please go to slide number 16. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify and create record levels of demand for our innovative products and services.\nWe are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging, uplifting culture. With the strength of our business operating system, we continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset.\nOur first-half performance, record backlog, and our outlook for the back half of the year give us confidence in raising our full-year revenue and EPS guide. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team, and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2022 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star one. To allow time for everyone to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you doing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood. Good. How are you?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nDave, to your point of considering backlog at that $6.5 billion, up over 40% versus just orders, maybe give us your perspective in terms of the visibility that backlog gives you into 2023 amidst the macro headwinds that everyone knows about. Just in terms of that visibility, have you seen any slowing in Core Americas commercial HVAC orders across any end markets, given those concerns?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start with the orders, and orders were very robust in the second quarter, really, and especially in the commercial HVAC business in Americas, really across all verticals, Andy. We didn't see any soft spots there. As far as the backlog, I mean, our backlog right now is at record level, $6.5 billion. Our book-to-bill in the second quarter was 111%. We see a backlog entering 2023, it'll be north of $6 billion, and that will give us great visibility into 2023, especially in our longer-cycle businesses, which are 80% of our backlog or 90% of our backlog, 80% of our business.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nDave, that's helpful. Maybe just digging in a little bit, could you give us a little more color into the EMEA supply chain and the price cost issues you've seen in that particular region? It's obviously a much smaller region for Trane than the Americas, but you've been hit hard there with supply chain issues, negative price versus cost. What's the difference there versus in the Americas? Could you talk about your confidence in expected improvement, especially if Europe does fall into a bigger slowdown?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. I'll start with the positive. In our Commercial HVAC, we continue to have strong backlog in EMEA. Order rates were up, low teens, and we continue to see strong demand. Revenues were up high-single-digits, with growth in both equipment and services. Thermo King business also continues to perform well, with organic revenues up low teens, outpacing the markets.\nWe did see acute supply chain challenges in Europe and a higher cost to serve our customers with spot buys and expedited freight. However, we see these as investments, really good investments, especially with the demand for our thermal management system and the opportunities to minimize the need of fossil fuels for our customers. Overall, I'm very confident long-term with Europe. This region continues to grow share through leading innovation. Supply chain will improve in the back half. It's going to be a gradual improvement. As it improves, the efficiencies in our factories will improve, and we'll get our margins back on track.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nSVP of Investor, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey. Good morning, John. How are you?\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nSVP of Investor, Credit Suisse\n\nMaybe I'll make a suggestion first. It'd be great on topics of interest. Maybe we take a look at services. We've done a lot of deep dive into the truck trailer market. Maybe we can start there. I mean, services up double-digits. I remember when we used to think this was a mid-single-digit plus grower. Kind of what's happening there, and where do you think services can continue to grow?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we're very happy with our services business, and I'll take your suggestion on topics of interest. Our service business over the last five years, and I'll speak globally, it's got a compound annual growth rate of high-single-digits. That's over a five-year period. In 2020, a pandemic year, our service business was flat to 2019, despite the fact that we were constrained with getting access to facilities. Very happy with our service business. It's roughly 1/3 of our total business globally. In the second quarter, it was, again, up double-digit rates. Very happy with the performance there, and a very resilient business.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nSVP of Investor, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Maybe just starting on the price cost conversation, maybe just remind us if you think we can get some of the commodity deflation benefits here in the back half, or if this is more of a 2023 story, and kind of how you guys would think about the phasing of the lower commodity costs rolling through. Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. John, it's Chris. I think it's going to be more of a 2023 story. Our practice has been for a long time to hedge and lock in on our main commodities for steel, copper, and aluminum. One to two quarters out, we're 70+% locked, and then three to four quarters out, we're 50% to 60% locked. Certainly, we're seeing the volatility in those markets, even in the second quarter, with, looked like, a bit of a pullback on steel and then a little bit of an uptick in terms of steel prices later in the quarter.\nWe see that more of a 2023 tailwind if we continue to see these commodities start to come down in terms of cost inputs. To Dave's point, we're being selective on the backlog and making sure we're booking orders with as much visibility as we can get, so we price appropriately. We're really happy with the price performance here in the second quarter, and it being positive on a dollar basis in Q2 over cost.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nSVP of Investor, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Good quarter, and I'll pass it on.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, John. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Julian.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning. Maybe just the first question around the operating leverage. I think, as you highlighted, you did sort of 16% in Q2. It sounds like Q3's guided about the same. That implies a big step up to sort of 35%+ in Q4. Maybe just confirm if that's correct. I guess, why in Q3 are you not seeing operating leverage improve if Asia's going from steep volume declines to a catch-up? Globally, you're probably over the hump in terms of price cost headwinds, and those should narrow.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Julian, if I step back on the first half, organic leverage was up about 12%, about 16% in Q2. We saw a nice improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. Back half of the year, we're expecting leverage to really be in the high teens, low 20s range.\nOur full-year guide on leverage is consistent with what we said in May, that it would be organically up mid-teens on a full-year basis. We baked into the guide, as I think about the third quarter and the fourth quarter, Dave mentioned an improving, but gradually improving supply chain. We baked into the guide that we're going to continue to see additional costs to serve our customers with spot buys and expedited freight. It's going to continue to cause factory disruptions, certainly on a year-over-year basis, Q3 and Q4. While it does get a little bit better sequentially, it's going to be a little bit of a challenge to the leverage on the second half.\nIt will be a gradual improvement, but that's where we thought Q3 would be around that mid-teens level like we saw in Q2, and Q4 would get a little bit stronger than that.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. Just sort of one follow-up around that. When we're thinking about kind of third-quarter earnings, probably sort of 10% or so growth year-on-year, mid-high teens leverage. Are we thinking sort of $2, that kind of earnings range? Any sort of thoughts on resi HVAC, what's dialed into that back half after a very strong Q2?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'd say for the third quarter, Julian, I think about the second-half revenue growth, kind of in that low teens range. We see that growth roughly the same in Q3 and in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, roughly the same growth.\nNow, the third quarter comes with higher dollars of revenues. It's traditionally our strongest quarter of the year in terms of top-line revenues. Q4 would come down off of Q3. Revenue growth, roughly the same for the second half and the two quarters. Leverage in Q3, more around that mid-teens organic range, and then it'll step up into the fourth quarter. That's how we kind of see that second half playing out. Yeah. I'll chime in here on the second part of that question on resi. First of all, I'll start with the second quarter.\nWe had just the team did just a fantastic job in the second quarter. I mean, we had 30% growth in the top line, and our book-to-bill was 101%. Our backlog was flat with a 30% growth on the top line. We have tough compares all year in resi with bookings level that we haven't seen before in 2021. We'll have some tough compares going into the back half of the year. For sure, we could see some negative bookings like we saw here in the second quarter. You got to really look at the backlog, the book-to-bill, and I couldn't be happier with our performance in our residential business today.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey. Good morning, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nSounds good. Thank you. I want to switch gears and go back to M&A. It's always kind of a question of, is there another round of consolidation or what more can be done globally? I know there's lots more opportunity, perhaps, outside of the US. Is your main pipeline in the distribution channel, is that how we should think about it, or is there more you think you can do down the road?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's a great question. Obviously, our M&A pipeline is full, as you would expect. We get to see all the opportunities being a large global player in HVACR. It's active. We don't just look at channel. We look really at anything that's in the pipeline that's available. I tell you that we don't need to do anything, as I've said before. We have great equipment portfolio, a great service portfolio, great access to channel. We'll look, and we're going to be patient, and we're going to make sure that we make the right investments.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nFair enough. Just separately, really, going back to the supply chain questions, I mean, is it a broad list of components that are hard to get, or is it more specific stuff? I mean, we've got other companies where it's just semiconductors and stuff. You guys, is it a wide list of stuff that's kind of short, or is it narrowing or a shorter list?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, that's a good question. I mean, our supply chain performed as expected during the second quarter, and we anticipate, as I said earlier, a gradual improvement through the back half of the year. Our team continues to do an excellent job managing through this environment, working closely with our suppliers. Yeah, electronics still is a theme. Chips have gotten somewhat better. We see progress working with our suppliers, and that's going to continue to get better in the back half.\nIt's other components like wire harnesses too. Again, we're working through it. We have a great team. They're able to solve problems, and it's open communication with our suppliers, and good things happen.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Good. Good luck. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, John.\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Can we just maybe on price cost? I think you guys told us last quarter it was roughly a 100-basis point impact to margins. I'm curious if you have that same color for Q2, whether that's supposed to get better in the second half of the year. I guess just maybe just thinking through that resi growth number that you gave, the 30%, I'm just curious if you can give us how much that was priced as well.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJoe, it's Chris. As I think about the second quarter kind of price cost, certainly a margin headwind. You're right. We described Q1 as about 100 basis points. I would describe Q2 as less than 100 basis points for a margin headwind. I don't want to dial it in any further than that. We were happy with the performance on a net basis with turning dollar positive, really moderately positive in the quarter, and it's giving us even more confidence as we think about the balance of the year to be positive on a full-year basis.\nI think that's one of the most improved parts of our business operating system that for the last 18 months in a very highly inflationary environment, we've been able to stay on the right side of the price cost equation, and happy to see us deliver that here in the second quarter. The second part of your question, I think, was resi growth. resi price. Yeah, 30% growth in the quarter overall for resi. What we're going to report today, price for the enterprise was up 10.4%. We'll report in the Q that the Americas price was up about 11.8%. I'll just say that resi was better than those averages here in the quarter in terms of price realization.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Quick follow-up. I know last quarter, I think you talked about K-12 order rates really picking up. I think they were up 50% in the first quarter. I'm just curious, did we see another step in the right direction on K-12 orders in Q2? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, I'd start with the education vertical. Joe has always been very strong for us, and we continue to see stimulus funds flow there. Incoming order rates in the second quarter were very strong for the education vertical. They were north of 40%. We continue to show great progress there, and we have a great process in place to help our customers track funds and to make sure that they're able to make the proper upgrades to their facilities.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat to hear. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Pokrowinsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Pokrowinsky\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrowinsky\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI want to go to Europe first, if we don't mind. Pretty solid commercial HVAC bookings growth there, and obviously a bit more macro uncertainty, to say the least. Just wondering how much of this you guys feel was sort of driven by what's going on, i.e., the energy paybacks with prices just skyrocketing there, or if this is just sort of stuff that had started through the process, maybe kind of pre-Russia-Ukraine, and it's just continued to go through. Where are we in terms of Q2 kind of representing what's really going on in the market?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'd say that Europe has shown market outgrowth for a long period of time now with our innovations that we have, specifically around thermal management systems. Obviously, what's happening right now with the war in Ukraine and the supply of energy into the rest of Europe from Russia, that's getting tighter.\nIt is a bit of a tailwind for sure as our thermal management systems eliminate the need for fossil fuel. Our original value proposition, which was extremely strong to our customers, just got stronger. We think that will be a continued tailwind into the future.\n\nJosh Pokrowinsky\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just on the price cost, I know everyone's trying to skin this cat a little differently, but I think in the applied business, there's kind of less of a list price, maybe go-to-market there, more of a job bidding strategy. What's been the historical kind of ability to hold price or maintain that spread as commodities come in, understanding that it's less of a list phenomenon? Yeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nJosh, what I would say is on those longer lead-type projects, first, the team is thinking about what does that future curve look like for commodities and costs when they're ultimately bidding the job. Some of those longer-term projects also allow for cost escalation depending on the external index for which we can adjust price if something were to change after we bid it out. As I think about the whole company, in a normal year, we go into the view of getting price cost, say, 20 to 30 basis points positive.\nWith the commercial businesses being the largest part of the company, they're very much in that same ballpark of, in a normal year, getting positive price cost, and then also having a lot of visibility, as best we can, into the forward curves of inflation and cost to price accordingly. Yeah.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nJosh, if I could just add, we do not see pricing going down next year. I mean, price increases that we have seen over the last 18 months likely will not continue at the same rate into the future, but we do not see prices coming down.\n\nJosh Pokrowinsky\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That is helpful context. Appreciate it. Good luck, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. How are you?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood execution in a choppy environment, for sure. Just digging back into the resi up 30, what do you think your channel movement was? I know you guys are kind of 50/50 independent and captive. 30% is just a pretty big number, obviously, relative to the guys that are reporting. Just curious as to if there were any differences between the channel and your more captive distribution.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Good question. I mean, we're really proud of the results we got in residential. I mean, up 30, you're right. The good news there is, or the shocking there is, is that our book-to-bill was 101%. Our backlog stayed flat as we entered Q3. Just to put some context around it, the sell-through in our IWDs was up in the 20s, right around 20%. It was a little bit stronger in our own channel. As far as inventory levels, they're about where we would expect them to be. Steve, we track that pretty carefully, especially our independent.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCaptive distributors, what percentage is parts and pieces or non-equipment?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI mean, we're about a 50/50 shop. Is that what your question? I'm not sure if you're going through the parts side of our business, Steve, or?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Yeah. Just your captive distributors if they do parts and services and things like that. The guys that you own.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOh, the guys we own. Oh, absolutely. I mean, they have part of that. I do not have the exact percentage in front of me, but we could dig that up for you. Okay. One quick follow-up on commercial. What was light commercial up in the quarter? Order demand. Yeah. Our incoming order rates for light commercial was very strong. In the Americas, it was up over 30%.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Steve.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Wolfe\n\nThanks. Good morning. Hey, Nigel. We have covered a lot of ground, but just want to come back to residential. You are obviously extremely strong results. You did use the word dynamics. I'm just wondering what sort of you're referring to there. Is that sort of the damage we're seeing elsewhere across the residential sector? Not HVAC, but across other end markets. Just wondering what dynamic would mean there. Really, this kind of period of bill from the Inflation Protection Bill has some provisions around subsidies for high-efficiency equipment. Just wondering kind of how you do that and what that could do to demands over the next 12 months or so.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, dynamic. I mean, it is a dynamic environment. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of price there, we're seeing volume there as well, a lot of different things happening at the same time. Obviously, we have a backdrop of very, very strong comparison from prior year. That's kind of what we mean around the being a dynamic space.\nAs far as the IRA that's currently working its way through Washington, yeah, at least the way it's written right now, at least the pre-draft that I've seen, there is a provision in there for electrification of heating, right, which is in the heat pump space for the homeowner. That could be a tailwind for sure if that goes through. We'll wait and see how that gets written and what the final proposal goes to Congress and to the Senate. Fair enough. No, that's good. My follow-on is on the buyback cadence.\nYou've done $750 million or thereabouts of buyback in M&A, so it's a bit more of a back-end load than that $1.9 billion. Just given the share price sort of through the second quarter, I thought I might see a bit more buyback activity during the quarter.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Wolfe\n\nJust wondering if there's any restrictions on buybacks during the quarter. Was there some M&A activity that potential during the quarter? Just wondering on the cadence there.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Nigel, I would say we're kind of looking at this quarter by quarter as we go through the year. You're right, about $750 million of deployment between M&A and share repurchases so far this year, and about $1.1 billion left to go when you already account for dividends that will be paid out in the second half. I think to today's point, the pipeline remains active in M&A. Certainly, by the end of the year, I'd like to see one or two transactions closed or committed to by the end of the year. We're just trying to make sure we leave some powder for that. At the same time, our balance sheet is very strong.\nWe got a lot of capacity here to do a lot of different things with the cash we have. I'd say at this point, the share price continues to look very favorable and trading well below our calculated intrinsic value. We would continue to deploy cash to shares if M&A isn't available as we think about Q3 to Q4. Let me, if I could, Nigel, I want to go back to a comment that Julian made earlier around leverage. I think for the third quarter, we commented that it would be around mid-teen, similar to Q2.\nIt could be a little better than that as we work through the quarter. The EPS estimate Julian put out of around $2, I think that could be a little higher than that. Maybe it's closer to the $2.10 range than it is the $2 range. That would come with a little bit stronger leverage, probably not above 20, but maybe it could be higher teens. In the mid-teens would be the range I'd be thinking about for Q3. Thanks. Let me add that.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Wolfe\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff. How are you?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nI'm doing great. Thanks. Sounds like you are too. Dave, can you just address lead times, and not lead times in your own supply chain, but just kind of the customer order behavior? We've seen across really the spectrum here that customers are ordering further in advance. I wonder if you could kind of just address that. Are orders being booked further in advance than typical? What is it that you're doing on kind of price and other things to make sure you're protecting yourself on the kind of longer tail on some of these orders?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the answer is yes. They are getting booked sooner. There are two reasons for that. One is our customers want to make sure we have enough visibility, and the second is that our lead times out of our factories are longer with all of our backlog. Yes, that is a fact. As far as how we're protecting ourselves from the pricing, some of the longer lead items we would actually put in escalations on. That's a portion of the business. It's not the entire business.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYou don't do that for transport? What is the difference with modulating transport orders?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, we don't do that in our transport business. There, we basically will go out a quarter or six months at a time to fill the backlog. We'll control that. It's not that we're not working with our customers on slots. We just won't be able to price it until we, in fact, get to a point in time. We have not yet opened up 2023 for orders. Now, we're talking with our customers, so we understand what their demands might be. We'll slot it so we make sure we don't disappoint them. We're just unable to price it at this time.\nWe just want to make sure we, in that business, it's very difficult to go back and say, well, I have to reprice something. It's been very volatile. We just want to be conservative from that standpoint and make sure we have the right price on the product.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nMaybe just finally for me, just more kind of big picture cycle. Sort of your call on resi from here, right? You're well aware of the debate and the replacement cycle, but it's hotter and we're running them longer, and SEER changes and kind of a whole mix of things going on. When you look forward into 2023 and 2024, I mean, do you see a legitimate argument for resi to stay at least on a relatively high plateau, or do you think there's some kind of give back that we need to get here cyclically?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's pretty dynamic, Jeff. I'll start with that. As I said earlier, I think the other variable that you may want to put into your model there is the SEER change that will be coming in 2023. Remember, that's going to be, depending on the model, that would be 10% to 15% on the top line. Now, I wouldn't expect it to be, expect margins to be neutral on that because obviously the product costs more for the higher SEER product. That's another tailwind on the top line that we'd be seeing. We haven't come up with our guide yet for 2023.\nWe're working through our planning process now. As I said before, we have very detailed models in this space. When we come up with our guide for 2023, we explain to you in a lot of details to what's happening. Remember, I sound like a little bit of a broken record here, but residential is only 20% of our total business. Even if it did fall by 10%, it'd be a 2% drop for the enterprise. The opportunities that we see in our commercial businesses, both Thermo King and our Trane commercial business, far exceed the 2%.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat, thanks for the insight.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSabrina Abrams\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, you have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. How are you guys?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nSabrina Abrams\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nFirst, I wanted to ask another question on Europe and sort of how the conversation on HVAC is changing in Europe given the recent weather, and in the longer term, what it means for your organization in Europe and what you need to do to be better positioned in Europe in order to get positioned for new climate trends.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, first of all, I think we're very well positioned with some of the latest innovation that we've introduced into the marketplace with our thermal management systems. I think that as you could eliminate the need for fossil fuels in buildings, that's the value proposition was already great. It just got even better. These products are significantly more efficient than conventional ways of thinking, which would have been a separate chiller plant and boiler plant. We now have technology that combines these. Your efficiency is up between 2x and 4x depending on what your heat sink is. We're very happy with our position there, and we're seeing a lot of traction.\n\nSabrina Abrams\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nCool. Thank you. Just quickly on the 2023 SEER change, can you talk about where you are in terms of transitioning production to the new high-SEER equipment?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We're certainly ready. We're well equipped for this. We already sold all the higher-SEER product prior to the change. We're in good shape there. Cool. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nSenior Analyst, Cowen\n\nYeah. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gautam. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gautam.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nSenior Analyst, Cowen\n\nDoing well. I had a couple of questions. One, nothing you said on the call would point people to worry in the commercial markets, at least, about a slowdown. I'm curious, can you comment on the front log, some of the project pipeline? Is there any timing slips related to them, any funding issues that you're seeing emerge, even anecdotally, more so than was the case maybe a year ago or three months ago? Is there any sign in the front?\nI mean, I'm assuming your question is more slanted towards the Americas, but it's been strong. If you look at the Architectural Billing Index, which is a good macro indicator to look at, it's been over 50 now for 17 months. We continue to see strength in the Americas. We have nice strength in EMEA, as we already talked. It was a good trend we had in Asia in the second quarter with our order rates there up in the 16% range. Overall, lots of strength. If you look at the longer-term macro trends, I would say it's going to be with us for a while. Secondly, we talked a little bit about raw material, copper, steel, aluminum.\nWhat about components broadly in terms of cost next year? Are you seeing inflation in those continuing and maybe offsetting whatever benefit we get from ROS, or do you think it's a net positive as we stand today on the cost side?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Hey, Gautam, we track for these calls and others, we generally spend a lot of time on tier one, but we track everything on the Tier two, which would be the components you describe from electrical components to motors to metal fabrication. We're tracking not only the input costs from the commodities to that, but also impacts on labor costs and others. As it stands right now, with things looking a bit more deflationary at this point versus, say, three months ago, six months ago, for us, it's really kind of looking as more of a benefit and a tailwind in 2023. Locking in steel, we locked that in for really six months. A cost in June is really going to be realized in December.\nAny type of pullbacks we see in deflation here in the third quarter really carries over into the first quarter of next year for steel. We've got the locking mechanisms in place with respect to copper and aluminum that also really push any change in price out roughly at least three to six months. I think it represents a tailwind if we continue to see a deflationary environment. I think that's also dynamic where it's hard to tell which way the market's going. We're really just making sure we follow a process where we hedge each and every quarter out with a similar level, so we smooth any type of increases on the way up. That means also a bit of a smoothing on the way down if you see deflation.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nSenior Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nYour line is open. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, good morning, Deane.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHey, question on data centers. Just what kind of growth rate are you baking in? A bit of a technical question. Do you see any threat to the growth in liquid cooling in data centers? Is this going to take share, or can they both coexist and not affect each other's growth path?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Well, I'll start with the latter there. The liquid cooling is certainly emerging technology that we're certainly doing a lot of work with. We'll see how that moves forward. We are aware of the technology, and some of our scientists are looking at that very closely. As far as we saw nice growth in the data, I don't have the exact number in front of me. We could dig that up for you.\nWe continue to see nice growth in data centers. I think you understand, Deane, it's part of the office vertical, so it gets a little bit complicated. We continue to have nice growth there. We have dedicated teams that work on data centers because there's a specific expertise there that we have that we work with our customers on.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGot it. As a follow-up on indoor air quality, and we talked about the education market, do you still feel good about that broad estimate of a 10-year path, 200 basis points annual top line? Just another more technical question. There was a year ago lots of focus on air disinfection technologies that seems to have waned a bit. Just give us a sense of what's the take rate in businesses, offices that are using disinfection technologies. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI mean, first of all, we see indoor air quality as a long-term secular megatrend for the industry. We continue to see growth there in lots of different verticals. It's not just in healthcare. We're doing indoor air quality. We're continuing to do indoor air quality in several different verticals, including education, office, as well as healthcare. As far as the cleaning of the air products like a dry hydrogen peroxide product, we continue to sell, and we continue to see demand for it. We don't see it waning. We think that indoor air quality is going to be top of mind for our customers for the foreseeable future. It's generally embedded in our applied systems, as well as our controls and our services.\nIt's harder to track as a standalone item, but we continue to see it as a growth tailwind for our business and really for the whole industry.\nThat's real helpful. Thank you.\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZac Nagle\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call, and we'll be around for questions in the coming days and weeks, as always. We look forward to seeing you on the road, hopefully in person in the near future. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q1 2022 Trane Technologies PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2022 Trane Technologies PLC Earnings Call\n\nTTNYSEMAY 4, 10:00 AM\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nChallenge what's possible for a sustainable world, and align to the megatrends that are only getting stronger. We are seeing the impact of climate change on the world every day, including more extreme weather events, and far-reaching effects on air quality, water quality, food production, and human health. The science is clear: there is no time to wait. The world must take action now to limit global warming and mitigate the effects of climate change. That's where our purpose meets our strategy. Trane Technologies is already taking action to dramatically reduce emissions through innovative solutions that drive electrification, energy efficiency, and emissions reductions for commercial buildings, homes, and transport. We have set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets that continue to push our innovation further and faster. Customers continue to choose us as their partner in achieving their sustainability goals while improving performance and efficiency.\nOur relentless approach to innovate, strong customer focus, and purpose-driven culture enable us to consistently outgrow our end markets. This, in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board: for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide number four. While we'll cover the details of the quarter and our outlook throughout our discussion today, the primary message I'd like investors to take away from today's call is that the company has never been in a stronger position to deliver highly differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns over the long term.\nOur end markets are strong, and our innovation leadership is at the apex of powerful secular megatrends of energy efficiency and decarbonization, which is enabling us to win customers at an unprecedented pace. Our business operating system remains at the core of everything we do and is delivering strong price realization to offset the impact of inflation, which is running at multiples of even the highest historical levels. Our balance sheet, liquidity position, and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provide a solid financial foundation. We have exceptional firepower and optionality to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to flourish as they abate. Our strong performance in the first quarter is ahead of our initial guidance expectations on both incremental price to offset higher inflation and on volume growth.\nWhile it's still early in the year and the macro environments remain very dynamic, our performance in Q1 serves to increase our confidence that we're on pace to meet or exceed our full-year guidance. Our booking levels remain extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our business, with supply chain challenges impacting throughput in the near term. The absolute booking levels we've delivered over the past year have been extraordinary. There is a tendency to focus on bookings' growth trends, but growth trends may be misleading when absolute numbers move step functions higher than any historical reference period. We encourage investors and analysts to consider both absolute bookings and bookings' growth to get a fuller picture. Our first quarter provides a prime example. Organic sales were up 12%, while organic bookings were up about half that amount, up 6%.\nA fairly normal reaction to bookings' growth being half the level of revenue growth might be to assume that the book-to-bill ratio would be negative, and that backlog would be lower as a result. However, given our tremendous bookings growth in Q1 2021 of over 30%, absolute bookings in the first quarter of 2022 were still extremely high at $4.3 billion. Even with strong revenue growth of 12%, absolute revenues in the first quarter of 2022 were $3.4 billion. It may be counterintuitive, but bookings exceeded revenues by more than $800 million. Our book-to-bill was extremely strong at 129%, and our backlog grew more than 50% year over year. Backlog also grew $800 million, or 15%, sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Given extremely high levels of bookings throughout 2021, we believe this is an important area to watch to gauge strength as we move forward.\nWith $16.8 billion in bookings and $14.1 billion in revenues in fiscal 2021, the dynamic I referenced as an example from Q1 will be present throughout the year. As I look at our business, the strong secular trends, our leading innovation, unprecedented customer demand, record backlogs, and the financial health of our company, I'm very bullish about the future. We have all the fundamental ingredients to deliver differentiated financial performance and strong shareholder returns over the long term. Please turn to slide number five. On Earth Day, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report. The report highlights our notable progress towards our science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, diversity and inclusion commitments, and other sustainability goals. I am proud of the progress we made last year. We exceeded or met nearly all of our annual targets on our glide path towards our 2030 sustainability commitments.\nWe reduced carbon emissions, energy use, waste, and water. In addition, we increased the representation of women in leadership, and workforce diversity reflective of our communities. I encourage you to read the full report. It's available on our website. Building on the momentum captured in our 2021 report, I'm happy to announce that we recently learned that our 2050 net-zero targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. At this time, we are the first company in our industry, and one of only 11 companies globally, to have 2050 net-zero targets validated. This is another example of how we are leading and challenging what is possible for a sustainable world, and we encourage like-minded companies to join us. Looking forward, I am confident we will continue to innovate, take bold actions, and transform the world for a better tomorrow today. Please turn to slide number six.\nCustomer demand for our climate-focused innovation continues to grow. We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings, up 6% in the first quarter. Organic revenues were also strong, up 12%. Supply constraints are impacting each of our segments, with particular tight supply as we move up the food chain on product complexity. Generally speaking, the more intelligent and complex the product, the more chipsets they require, and the more constrained the supply in the near term. Given extremely high levels of demand and backlog more than double historical norms, unconstrained revenues would be significantly higher in every segment. As mentioned previously, our bookings in the quarter totaled $4.3 billion, far exceeding our revenue of $3.4 billion, which were in part constrained by global supply chain and other macro challenges. With these robust bookings, our backlog grew to a record $6.2 billion.\nAmericas commercial HVAC business continues to deliver extremely strong bookings. Over the past four quarters, bookings growth has averaged nearly 30%, and Q1 bookings were up approximately 35%. Strength was broad-based, with applied and unitary each up more than 50%. Service bookings were also strong, up mid-teens. Demand for our comprehensive solutions remained strong, and contributed to our low-teens organic revenue growth in commercial HVAC Americas. The residential HVAC markets also remained strong. Our residential HVAC team delivered mid-single-digits bookings growth and low-teens revenue growth in the quarter. As expected, Transport Americas bookings were down in the quarter on tough prior-year compare and because we intentionally constrained demand in order to manage inflationary risks. Unconstrained demand would be much stronger, but customers understand the dynamics and are working closely with us on slots.\nBookings remained at healthy levels, with bookings in excess of revenues in the quarter, adding to backlog sequentially from Q4. Revenues were strong, up mid-teens. Turning to EMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. EMEA commercial HVAC bookings were up low-teens, and revenues were up low single digits. As expected, transport bookings were down on tough prior-year compares. Similar to our Americas transport business, we are intentionally constraining demand in order to manage inflationary risks. Absolute bookings remained at healthy levels, with bookings in excess of revenues, and backlog up sequentially from Q4. Revenues were strong, up high single digits. Our Asia Pacific team delivered strong bookings and revenue growth of 14%, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number seven. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by both strong volume growth and continued strong price execution. Turning to margins, we drove strong core incremental margins of approximately 30% on solid volume growth of 5%. Volume growth was stronger than expected due to our outstanding performance by our teams and partnership with our suppliers in what remains a choppy supply chain environment. Strong price execution through our business operating system also enabled us to neutralize the impact of higher inflation on a dollar basis, with about a 100 basis point headwind to margins in the quarter. Productivity was significantly impacted by continued supply chain challenges, including choosing to incur expedited freight costs and spot buys, consistent with our customer-focused business model. In addition, we continue to make strong incremental business reinvestments, supporting our sustainability-focused strategy.\nAll in, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins declined 70 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 11%, driven primarily from higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to slide number eight. We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page. The dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments, with volume growth, strong price realization, incremental business reinvestments, and innovation, and macro challenges impacting productivity and cost inflation as consistent drivers. Our Americas segment delivered strong price execution, slightly ahead of material inflation and offsetting expected negative impacts from negative price cost in both our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments. Consistent with our prior guide, we expect price cost to improve throughout 2022 in each region, and we expect to be price cost positive on a dollar basis for the full year for the total company. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number nine. As we've discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher, with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through relentless innovation for our customers. We're driving unprecedented demand, with orders up nearly 30% over the past four consecutive quarters, which is indicative of our clear market leadership. We're exiting the first quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year over year and more than double historical norms. Markets remain strong, with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022.\nUnemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February 2021, remain favorable. Demand remains strong in data center, warehouse, education, and healthcare. Every day, we see customers establishing their own sustainability targets. We're creating decarbonization roadmaps and helping them to achieve their targets with our customized system-based approach. We're helping our KQ12 customers deploy federal stimulus funds to improve the indoor air quality of schools. We see both decarbonization and indoor air quality as multi-year tailwinds for our business, given our deep customer relationships and expertise. Demand for our residential products remains strong. We enter the second quarter with tailwinds from record backlog and expected strong price realization. We see headwinds from lapping tough growth compares from 2021. Turning to Americas transport, ACT projects continued market growth through their forecast horizon of 2023.\nI'll talk more about transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA, while we have muted expectations for market growth with a volatile geopolitical backdrop continuing, demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remains strong, and we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth. Turning to Asia, we are monitoring the COVID lockdowns in China and their broader impact on the region. Outside of Shanghai, we have a plant impacted by the lockdowns that provide equipment or components to support our customers in China and the rest of Asia. Our guidance assumes China reopens mid-May, and any revenue impact due to the China lockdowns during Q2 will be recouped in the second half of the year. For the year, we continue to see underlying strength in China's data center, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare markets.\nOutside of China, the picture is mixed, with COVID-related lockdowns still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales model is differentiated in the region and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in both equipment and services. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our guidance for Q2 and full year 2022. Chris?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number ten. Based on the market outlook Dave just outlined, and our strong bookings and backlog, we are on track to deliver strong financial performance in 2022. We are updating our full-year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 10%, primarily to reflect additional strong price realization to offset persistent material inflation. Our adjusted EPS outlook remains unchanged between $6.95 and $7.15.\nWe continue to expect a stronger second half with an improving supply chain and product redesigns coming online that will help us serve our customers better and provide added resiliency to our supply chain. Our updated operating leverage outlook of approximately mid-teens contemplates both additional price realization and additional material inflation. We continue to expect price-cost to be slightly positive for the year on a dollar basis. We expect free cash flow to remain strong at equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Our outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues, and high ROI projects in support of our profitable growth objectives and our sustainability commitment. These high ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency, as well as investments to further decarbonize our operations.\nOur free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth. Please turn to slide number 11. While we traditionally provide annual guidance, given the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we believe it may be constructive to provide an outlook for the second quarter based on what we see today. For the second quarter, we expect core organic revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12%. As mentioned previously, our second quarter Asia Pacific revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by the lockdowns in China by approximately $80 million to $100 million, a headwind of approximately 2% to 3% for the total company. Our guidance assumes China reopens mid-May, and any revenue headwinds due to the China lockdowns during Q2 will be recouped in the second half.\nNet, we expect our organic second quarter revenues to be up high single digits, and expect continued strong price realization. At this stage, we expect to offset inflation with price on a dollar basis, which carries a heavy margin headwind for the quarter. We see macro supply chain challenges continuing to hamper productivity. We also expect continued expedited freight costs and spot buys, as we focus on meeting our customers' needs for sustainable solutions. As we discussed on the prior slide, our full-year outlook contemplates a stronger second half, with an improving macro environment. We'll continue to update our full-year outlook as the year goes along. Please go to slide number 12. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023.\nImportantly, we continue to invest these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. We've highlighted some of our innovation for decarbonization on slide 21 of this presentation for your reference. Please go to slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value.\nPlease turn to slide number 14, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the first quarter, we deployed $506 million in cash, with $350 million to share repurchases, and $156 million to dividends. Our board also authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, bringing our total remaining share repurchase authorization to $4 billion as of the end of the first quarter. Turning to M&A, we completed a small channel acquisition in April, and our M&A pipeline remains active. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2022, inclusive of $1.9 billion between M&A and share repurchases. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality, and dry powder moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 16. Global transport markets are expected to remain healthy through 2023. ACT has recently moderated their expectations for transport growth in North America for 2022, largely driven by expected OEM trailer supply chain constraints. European forecasts have moderated somewhat also, reflecting current OEM supply constraints and uncertainty related to the conflict in Ukraine. Weighted average transport market growth in Americas is 8%, down about four points. EMEA market transport growth is forecasted to be flat, down about three points from our previous outlook. After clear share gains in truck, trailer, and APU globally in 2021, we're expecting global outgrowth in 2022 as well. Please go to slide number 17. We've updated the transport growth outlook slide for North America in the slide deck for reference and additional transparency.\nACC continues to call for a nine-year average for North America trailers in the mid-40,000 unit range through 2023, with the pandemic in 2020 being the only significant outlier. Please go to slide number 18. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging, uplifting culture. Despite a number of persistent macro challenges, Q1 was a record quarter for us, which provides a solid foundation as we move into the rest of the year. While it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance and our outlook for the second quarter have us well positioned to meet or exceed our full-year guidance. We're seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our innovative products and services, and our backlog has never been stronger.\nWe're executing our business operating system well and expect to continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset. We believe we have the fundamental ingredients to deliver strong performance across the board in 2022 and beyond, and to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. We'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star one. To allow time for everyone to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, everybody.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How you doing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nGood. Good. Thank you. Kind of big picture question here.\nI mean, the energy independence theme in Europe is center stage, or I think taking or getting a lot of attention here. How does that change the HVAC landscape? I mean, are you seeing more incomings related to trying to drive a little bit more energy efficiency there? Is that a real driver yet of demand?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, we're seeing unprecedented demand right now, as you saw our results in the first quarter. A lot of it has to do with our new innovations around products that are helping our customers decarbonize, which is just a massive opportunity in the future.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah. I think, actually, I mean, I think what I've kind of meant, Dave, is it incrementally make it, I mean, demand has been strong in Europe, but is it incrementally increasing just in the last few months since the Ukraine invasion?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWe're still seeing strong growth in Europe. I think you also have some regulation that's starting to come through there where fossil fuels are just not going to be permitted in certain countries. We see that continuing to grow with, I think, Germany was the latest country to adopt that type of legislation. A lot of the products that we have, and I think we're now on our, I was just over in Europe a couple of weeks ago, and we're on our fifth-generation thermal management system, which is really the combination of a boiler and a chiller into a system, allows the customer to accelerate their decarbonization efforts by eliminating fossil fuel. We're excited about the opportunity. It keeps growing. We keep innovating for it. I would tell you, it's not just unique to Europe. We're seeing it really on a global basis.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Given your stock price and just market dynamics overall, should we expect a big tick up in buybacks in Q2?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. This is Chris. What I would say is, yeah, we see a lot of value in our shares today. Frankly, we saw a lot of value in our shares three months ago. We take a long-term view in terms of stock valuation and looking at our intrinsic value. As we noted on the prepared remarks, we have a lot of firepower with respect to repurchases. $3 billion new authorization provided by our board here in the first quarter puts total capacity around $4 billion here at the end of the first quarter. We really like the position we're in. The balance sheet has got a lot of capacity to do both M&A and repurchases, so we're not limited.\nThe guide on the year is $2.5 billion roughly of deployment with about $1.9 billion to share repurchase and M&A. We'll continue to execute that quarter by quarter as we go through the year. Our priorities remain consistent in how we allocate our funds and our cash. We see a lot of value in the shares. We have a lot of firepower. I think we're really on track for the full year here to deploy that cash.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Sounds good. Thank you. Good luck, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Scott. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nDoing well, guys. Thanks for the question. Just the first one, I've been asking this to basically every company, but the China lockdown exposure, the $80 to 100 million, just how has that progressed in Q2? Clearly, you're assuming the reopening in mid-May. That's not too far away. Just give us kind of your confidence that you feel like that's pretty well ring-fenced at this point.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, let me just take a higher level first. I mean, we've had a manufacturing strategy for years of in-region, for-region. The factory that has been locked down is in the Shanghai region. Understand that about 90% of our supply chain tends to follow our manufacturing strategy. Think of it as a manufacturing plant. You'd have about 90% of that located in that same region. We anticipate the factory will be back online in the quarter.\nThe pause, as we said earlier, will result in approximately $80 to 100 million in revenue moving out of the quarter. We plan on making it up in the back half of the year. We're starting to see some positive signs where we see some movement happening in the area again. We'll stay tuned. Right now, our guide has us reopening in the second half of the month that we're in.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. That's helpful, Dave. I guess maybe my follow-on there is just the recoup of the backlog in the back half of the year, and then also the pricing that is in your backlog today that you're building. How do you get comfort that, number one, you will be able to recoup and there isn't potential lost revenue there or lost backlog there?\nSecondly, on the pricing dynamics, just given the inflationary backdrop that we're in right now, that you guys are pricing accordingly and the margins will come through accordingly?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I'll start with being able to recoup. We have a lot of capacity in our facilities there, so we're pretty confident we'll be able to, once we get turned back on, we'll be able to turn back on. We also have a smaller workforce in our facility today, with obviously proper permission for them to be there, making sure that all of our equipment is, in fact, being run. Some of these precision machines, you need to make sure they stay fine-tuned. We're proactively doing that. When the word is go, we're ready to go. We're pretty confident we can recoup this in the back half of the year. Chris, you want to talk about pricing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, sure. I'll talk about the firmness of the backlog too, Joe. We don't see any risk right now on the backlog. Everything appears to be firm from a pricing perspective. We're on our second round of price increases here in 2022. We wound up with three rounds, roughly, of price increases in 2021. Certainly, from, say, 90 days ago, material inflation in the quarter, in Q1, and certainly on the full-year basis, is going to be higher than what we thought 90 days ago. We're seeing stronger price realization. The second round of price increases is giving us confidence that we've got the opportunity to be flattish in the second quarter and be price-cost positive on the full year.\nOn the backlog, in terms of pricing, as we think about our longer live, let's say, applied systems orders, those orders, given that they're six, nine, 12 months out, will generally have a price escalation clause inserted in there. There's some protection in that regard. In our residential business, not only through price increases we've done, same in the commercial side, but with the price increases we've done, we've also repriced the backlog. It's given us an opportunity to reset that pricing when we see a material change in inflation. Last but not least, on the transport portfolio, we've had price increases as well there. We're also really intentionally managing the demand and the bookings, making sure we're only opening up the bookings for a quarter when we've got good line of sight to what the cost is going to be in that quarter.\nWe're intentionally kind of limiting demand at this point. I would say, for example, we don't have order books mostly open in the fourth quarter this year. It would be an area where we're kind of pausing until we get closer to understand the cost environment. We're not seeing demand destruction at this point at all with the price increases we've had to put in place. In fact, we really look at them as inflation-based price increases. We're really not out here to price gouge. We're just trying to offset the inflation that we've got. Hopefully, that helps.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions here.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning, John. Hope all's well. Yeah.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. I guess if we could focus on the strengths in the Americas. One of your competitors had some issues around light commercial. Another one seemed like they had some supply chain issues with controls. I guess, can you kind of talk about if you're seeing any market share shifts or maybe what you think you outgrew the market or what the market did blended for the Americas?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, I'd tell you, if you think about the Americas, our commercial HVAC business continues to see very healthy end markets. Very low unemployment, positive architectural billing index for 14 months in a row now, which is just a great indicator for six to nine months. Applied and unitary bookings were both up over 50% in the quarter. 50%. We're seeing tremendous demand right now, and we believe that that's going to continue. We're seeing broad-based growth too.\nElectronics, data centers, education, healthcare, office. I mean, as I looked across the verticals last week, I couldn't find a vertical that was down. We're continuing to see very strong demand there. Decarbonization of the built environment continues to be a tailwind for us. Indoor air quality continues to be a tailwind. A lot of strength in the commercial HVAC business in the Americas. If you go over to RES, it's only about 20% of our business. We saw a strong quarter. The team did well there. 6% order growth. That comes against a very tough compare where last year we were up the exact number. It was north of 40. Very strong growth there. As far as share goes, it's hard for me to say in a constrained environment.\nYou could look at order share and shipping share and get two totally different answers. Our product is obviously, and our backlog is more weighted towards our applied complex products. As we said in our opening remarks, think about that as where the constraint tends to be more. The more intelligent your product is, the more chipsets that are required, the more constraint in the short term. Long term, we're very, very bullish about our market share gains. We're very bullish too about what we're seeing in the market and hitting the spots with our innovations.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for that answer. Maybe if we think about the guidance construct, I think a couple of times you said meet or exceed, obviously still a lot of year left. You put the FX headwind now in the numbers. What's kind of maybe coming in a little bit better to offset that as you think about the portfolio? Thank you.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. You're right. For the full year, adjusted EPS, we held at $6.95 to 7.15. We did incorporate about $0.05 of headwind from FX in that guide as well. We're feeling confident we can offset that. Look, we're in the first quarter of the year. It's traditionally the lightest quarter of the year when we think about HVAC companies. We're happy with the results where we are in the first quarter. It turned out stronger than we thought when we guided 90 days ago or so. It's giving us increased confidence on the full-year basis. We took the full-year revenue up to 10%, or approximately 10%, given what we're seeing in increased price realization.\nRight where we sit, we're in the first quarter. We've got three more to go. We're certainly going to update you and the group when we get to the Q2 earnings release because we'll be halfway through the year at that point. We'll have a much better sense on where things are shaking out on the full-year basis. With the performance in the first quarter and the guide in Q2, we really de-risked a bit of the back half of the year. We got out ahead of price here in the first quarter. That's a good sign. We thought we'd be okay there, but a little bit stronger than where we landed, a little bit stronger than where we thought. It's just giving us more confidence also on the full-year basis that we should be price-cost positive on a dollar basis. Great.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. Good quarter. I'll pass it along.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, John. Appreciate that.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andy Kelleher with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Siege\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey. Good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. Good morning. Good. How are you?\n\nAndy Siege\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nMaybe you could just give us a little more color into how you're looking at RESI HVAC in 2022. You said strong quarter. You said in the past, revenue construction would be up low single digits. I think using your words, Dave, you said replacement won't fall off a cliff, but books were up mid-single digits and revenue started the year up low teens, as you said. Give us a little more color on your outlook now and how you're thinking about inventories in the channel.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. It's a good question. Not to reiterate, but order rates remained strong in the first quarter, up 6%.\nThat was a bit of a surprise to us considering we were up 40% the prior year. The demand continues to be strong. Our independent sell-through was strong. The inventory in the channel is about where we expect it to be. In the first quarter, we had growth in the new construction channel, although it's a smaller portion of our business. We'll watch interest rates there and see what happens. To use your words, we don't see it falling off a cliff, the replacement cycle. Again, RESI is about 20% of our business. Even if the replacement cycle did drop 10%, which we don't see it happening, it would be about a 2% drop for the enterprise.\nThe amount of opportunities that we are seeing in the decarbonization opportunities in both our Commercial HVAC business and our Thermo King business on a global basis will far exceed that.\n\nAndy Siege\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks for that, Dave. I think you said last quarter that you would be upside down on price versus cost by $30 to 40 million in Q1, but it turns out you were relatively flattish. I think you mentioned accelerated price realization. Was this really just going in and repricing your backlog? Did the mix help you at all? Does it really give you more confidence in sort of staying ahead in terms of that sort of modest green for the year in price versus cost?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andy. It does give us confidence on the full-year basis. You're right. We guided negative price-cost in the first quarter, and we wound up realizing flattish.\nCertainly, some additional volume coming through allows for maybe a little bit more price to come through. I would tell you that the price execution by our teams has been very strong. I know these are not easy conversations to have with customers. We hear that all the time from our businesses and our leaders. The fact is, though, we're trying to just offset this persistent inflation. In the quarter, it was a little bit more inflation, a little bit more price. We got it to flattish. Given our comp on the first half of the year, very strong price a year ago with moderate inflation is where our thoughts were we could have some headwinds in the first half of the year. It's giving us confidence we're going to be flattish on the first half of the year on a dollar basis for price-cost. Yeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nReally, our business operating system is really being leveraged across the enterprise right now. We see what's coming around the corner, and the teams are being very proactive. Andy, you also asked a question about mix. Yeah, mix helped us a bit in the quarter. We are seeing mix up. That really, that's a good news story because that's where a lot of our innovation is.\n\nAndy Siege\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. Have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey. Just wanted to start off perhaps with the volume outlook. I think you talked initially a few months ago about volumes being kind of flattish in the first quarter or even down. You ended up, I think, plus 5 or so. Just wanted to understand kind of what drove that volume upside. As you look at the balance of the year, what are we expecting in terms of kind of volume versus price? Do you see that 5% of volume slowing down, for example, because of RESI HVAC or things like transport with the ACT adjustment?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Let me start, and then I'll ask Chris to comment a little bit on the pricing side. As far as the volume is concerned, what we saw in the first quarter, it's not a demand. Our demand is constrained by supply. Okay? With our backlog, if we had unconstrained supply right now, we'd be shipping much more, and we'd be invoicing much more.\nIn the first quarter, we opportunistically bought some, for lack of better explanation, chipsets on the open market in spot buys, which we think is a good investment for retaining our customers. We wanted to take care of them. We saw an opportunity, and we executed on it. We saw more volume come through in the first quarter as a result of that. Now, can that continue through the rest of the year? Supply chain, as we said in the fourth quarter, is going to be choppy through the first half of the year. We have more confidence in the back half of the year, working with our suppliers closely, understanding their constraints, understanding their commitments to us. Also, some self-help redesigns that we have coming online in the third quarter. That gives us confidence in the back half of the year. I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about pricing.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I would add, Julian, to Dave's point on being aggressive and opportunistic. That will probably continue here into the second quarter. We'll see what's available and see if we can do better there. On pricing, look, the realization came in stronger in the first quarter. We've got a second round of price increases that we've already announced for this year, and we're remaining nimble, depending on what happens with material inflation and freight inflation for the year to correspond appropriately. I think, as Dave mentioned, on the second half with the self-help initiatives, the redesigns that we have, that gives us confidence the second half is going to have stronger volume growth.\nWith that comes stronger incrementals and ultimately, hopefully, less and less inefficiencies in the plants and otherwise that have really been pervasive for us in the second half of last year and really so far this year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks a lot. Just on that second point, yes, just looking at kind of what's implied for the back half, as you said, it looks like you're looking at sort of maybe 40% plus kind of half-on-half operating leverage, year-on-year, something like in the 30s for the back half on leverage. Just wanted to check those numbers were roughly okay. To your book, Chris, that's a mix of what price cost. Is the assumption that the margin headwind on price cost by Q4 is about zero? That's part of it. You also have some of those volume inefficiencies cleaning up. Yeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI'd say on the second half, certainly, we expect incrementals to be stronger than the first half. We'll see where it kind of plays out on the second half of the year, Julian. Given the volume coming through, let's say 30%+ incrementals, we'll see where productivity under inflation falls out. I do think on a full-year basis, we're going to see the price-cost equation, even if we're positive on a dollar basis, that is still going to present some challenges on the margin in terms of being able to get that positive. I just think that math may be challenging throughout the year. We do expect leverage to be stronger in the second half. We see on a full-year basis that organic leverage being around the mid-teens range, based on what we see today.\nWe'll update you and the team here in the next quarter earnings release based on another quarter of performance. We'll see where that kind of falls out for the year. Again, in the first quarter, we've been really pleased with what our teams have been able to do around procurement and engineering to find solutions. I know that they're still trying to do that today.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. Thanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Good morning, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust kind of continuation on Julian's question there on what sort of the margin kind of cadence maybe is from here. I know you guys have talked about kind of longer-term 25% incrementals.\nAs we kind of work through maybe the worst of this kind of inflation wave where price and cost are both high and drive down margins, and some of this supply chain interruption, do we get to have this period of kind of above-trend incrementals for a while, or are you still kind of sticking with 25% as the longer-term number?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, we like 25% as a long-term number. Last year, we were able to drive 30% incrementals, and part of that was getting out in front of price earlier. We had good volume last year, so those really contributed to above the long-term target. This year, it really is a price-cost dynamic that's just having that headwind on the margins on the first quarter and likely on the full year.\nI do think, depending on where direct material inflation falls out, Josh, this is an industry that typically holds on to price fairly well. If we start to see deflation, which we do not see right now on the full-year basis in 2022, but if you do see deflation, supply chains continue to recover, and we get our strong incrementals on volume, we can offset price cost. We'll see where that plays out. That may be a good formula for us. Long-term, we like the 25%. One thing I would add, in the quarter and also for Q2 and the guide, we continue to invest incremental investments into our innovation and new product development. That's not something we're at all relenting on. Again, we'd like to save five points of incrementals. Let's say, let's take five points of that incremental.\nLet's invest it back in the business to get us to that 25% long-term target.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful. On the applied orders, Dave, I think you mentioned that those were up more than 50%. Any way to sort of break down that on the replacement side? I would imagine that's even stronger still. How much of that is sort of higher bill of material or kind of scope versus higher volume?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I don't have the direct split yet on the retrofit versus new, but I would tell you that it was strong across all verticals, okay? Data centers, electronics. It really just speaks volumes to the innovations that we've been able to put into the market. We have customers that we're winning today because of the solutions that we're able to provide. It's not just about the chiller.\nIt's about the control system that goes with it. It's about the building controls. It's about being connected to the product. It's about being able to run AI algorithms against data that's in a data warehouse to improve the efficiency of buildings, data centers, and hospitals. It's all of that system of things that's just really, we're in high gear here. You could see it by the order rates that we're taking in. The team is really excited. I was out in one of our sales offices a couple of weeks ago, and I would tell you that the teams there have never been more pumped up about, number one, the innovation that we're providing them to go to talk to customers about and to win customers, but just the strength that they're seeing within the marketplace. It's an exciting time right now.\nWe're hopeful that the, and we believe it will, the back half of the year from a supply constraint will get better. We'll take some of this massive backlog that we have right now, $6.2 billion of backlog. I never thought I would say that. $6.2 billion of backlog, which 90% of it is on our commercial HVAC business. We'll start shipping it, and we'll start taking care of customers.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood. Thanks, Dave. Best of luck.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThank you. Thanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Steve. Good morning.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nOperator\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for opening the books a bit and with more precision on the price-cost impact. That's super helpful for the models, for sure. That precision is much appreciated.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, no problem.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSecond of all, Steve, I thought you were going to thank me for delivering such a strong first quarter.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nWhy would I thank you for that? Yeah. On the commercial HVAC orders, I thought you said applied and unitary were both up. Did you say north of 50% or north of 15%? I didn't quite catch that.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\n50. 5-0.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nIf commercial HVAC orders were up 35, does that mean that, I guess you're talking about services in there as well? Would have been above or below that? Yeah. Exactly.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nServices, think of it services as 50/50, right? 50% of our business is services. Our services were up double digits, so low teens.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. What are you guys assuming for orders? How does that order trend as we move throughout the year? Not necessarily asking for precision, but does the 6% accelerate? Does it go to flat? Are you expecting any kind of negative order comps here in the next couple of quarters?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, again, if the comps get tough, right? Remember, last year, our order rates were up over 30% in virtually almost every quarter. They get difficult. I think you could be looking at, if you look at a global basis, think about Commercial HVAC as probably a bit positive. Think about Thermo King. Again, there are different dynamics going in in that space where we're actually constraining some of the incoming order rates purposely just to manage inflationary risks. That could be down a bit. Flattish, maybe ±1% or 2% on a global basis, Chris? Yes.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "I think if you kind of think through a scenario, if bookings are flattish in 2022 versus, say, 2021, that's the $16.8 billion that Dave referenced before. We've got about 10% revenue growth approximately on the full-year basis. Kind of do that math, it would tell you that the backlog should grow by over $1 billion here just by the end of 2022. We entered 2022 with record backlog, and we thought, well, maybe that could moderate or even come down. I think the way we could see it today is that that backlog could be even higher by $1 billion or more as we go into 2023. It's looking like it should be a very strong year through the balance of this year, and then ultimately as we start 2023.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. I won't say thank you, but I will say a good execution. Congrats.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Steve. All right.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Nigel. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Good, thanks. Good. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground. I do want to have a crack at the, obviously, the extraordinary growth in the commercial HVAC backlog. In times gone by, we've seen some larger multi-year orders coming through. I'm just wondering if we are seeing some of these mass retrofit large orders coming through the backlog here, or are these just a broad base of smaller orders?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. There's nothing like a big ESCO job that books. This is just broad-based growth across many different verticals. You think about what's happening with decarbonization. You think about what's happening in the education vertical. Think about what's happening with indoor air quality in many verticals. It's nice tailwinds. We've been saying that for a while, and you're seeing it in our order books.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIs the conversion really guided by, obviously, supply chain and capacity? Are customers putting in orders for multi-years here or getting in line longer than they normally would?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Longer than they normally will just because of our extended lead times, but nothing that I would say is extraordinary. It really is a supply constraint. If we had unlimited supply, we'd be shipping a lot of product right now.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMy follow-on question is really around the supply chain. It seems that you've got a pretty good handle on the chip supply. I think one thing we've seen is a lot of quarterly volatility. Rockwell yesterday got tripped up, had a good first quarter, not so good second quarter.\nJCI, as you ramp up into the stronger Q2 and Q3 periods, how much paranoia and visibility do you have on that supply? I'm just wondering, obviously, we're now into April. You got visibility on May. What gives you the confidence that you're not going to get tripped up by, I don't know, something happening in the next couple of months?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, I'm not very paranoid as a person, so I won't use that term. It really has to do with working with our suppliers. It's just amazing open communication, understanding what their constraints are, understanding what our needs are. We have some of our what we're calling self-help redesigns. We're simplifying some of our designs to help our suppliers have more throughput to us, whether it be with wire harnesses is a great example. Those are the kind of things that we've been executing on.\nA lot of those are going to come on in the back half of the year. We've seen surprises before, but we're pretty confident that the back half is going to be better than what we've seen here, at least in the first half, which remains choppy. Our team is just doing an excellent job too managing this day-to-day. They have a problem, they triage it, they overcome it. We have incredible processes that we've set up now. We're getting really, really sophisticated at executing when a problem does arise.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thanks, Dave. Sure, Nigel.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. How are you? Thanks for fitting me in.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andrew. How are you?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nJust a question on sort of thinking about interest rates and the business model.\nJust sort of talking to folks in the channel, it seems that low interest rates impacted people's ability to carry more inventory, right, because floor financing is relatively inexpensive. Despite significant pricing on the resi side, right, a lot of folks are offering financing. Once again, rates are low. Instead of buying outright, you sort of finance. You feel better about your purchase on the resi side. With interest rates going up, how do you guys think about changes to the business model and how much impact these low interest rates have had on the channel over the past several years? An open-ended question, but just wondering if you guys have given any thought to that. Thanks.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nCFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Andrew.\nI would say the short answer is, in the last three to six months, we're not really seeing much of a change in terms of demand based on changes in interest rates. There are financing options that are out there selling to the consumer. It may be coming at a little bit of a higher cost to a distributor today, but it's not changing the idea around the record demand and ultimately serving customers. I would say we don't see that changing the business model. Looking backwards or even looking out over the next year, we don't see that really changing.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Andrew, I would just add that even with interest rates, and I guess we'll find out at 2:00PM, at least East Coast time today, what the Fed decides to do, they're still pretty low rates comparably to historical norms.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. No, that makes sense.\nJust a follow-up question. Look, clearly, execution stands out this quarter. Maybe we know why there were no chips left in Milwaukee. In terms of—sorry, I lost my train of thought. In terms of thinking about SEER transition, where are we? How much more visibility do we have into the year? How much sort of pull forward do you think we're going to get from 2023 on that? Thanks a lot.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, no problem. Yeah. As far as the SEER transition, we don't see a big pre-buy. I think it really has to do with the way this SEER change is being executed with the South, at least at the AC level. It's an install base, so it's not a manufacturing date. The North is a manufacturing date.\nThink of it more as a phase-in, phase-out of inventory that we'll see in the South. We're actually really good at this with all of our innovation. We're constantly doing phase-in, phase-outs within our own plants. We're taking those chapters out of our business operating system and helping our distributors manage their inventory in a proactive way. We don't see a big pre-buy, and we're certainly more than ready for this transition to higher SEER products.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nTerrific. Thanks a lot.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. Good morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nHey, just a quick clarification if we could. We've seen your competitors do this, but not opening the Q4 order book to get a better read on the material cost. Was that a TK specific?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Specifically to Thermo King.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nRight. What happens to customers in that situation? Do they just—do you risk losing an order there? Do they wait? Just what are the competitive dynamics?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo, I think it's more about explaining to the customer that we're trying to ensure that, one, we can price it properly, but they're probably also getting constrained from another OEM as well, whether it be a trailer or a tractor. We're trying to help them marry that demand up. Slotting in this industry is not new. It's not only Thermo King. It's also trailer as well as tractors that we're seeing some of that happen. We're working with our customers. They know these are—we have some pretty loyal customers in our Thermo King business, as you can imagine, with the innovations that we have in our products. We haven't seen customers move away from that.\nThey understand the reason why, and they're working with us as that dynamic continues to persist.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nThat's helpful. Just lastly, are you still executing the laddered purchasing of steel, copper, aluminum in the quarter where you would have 100% purchased ahead of time in the current quarter, 80% next quarter? Is that still the dynamic? Are you able to fill those goals?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Deane. For copper and aluminum, we are laddering out purchases and locking in quantities. Think of it as one quarter out, we're probably around 75% to 80% locked. Copper and aluminum, two quarters out, you're probably in that 50% to 60% range. Then three quarters, four quarters, that drops to about 25% to 30%. We've continued to execute through that here in this environment the last several years. We think that's a good process for us not to speculate on steel.\nWith our forward buy and our mill buy programs, we're generally locking in price for about six months. Looking out, any changes in price today would really have an impact for us really in the fourth quarter.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nThat's real helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have run out of time for the Q&A session on today's call. I will turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks.\n\nZach Nagle\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Trane Technologies\n\nGreat. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be around to answer questions in the coming days and weeks, and we look forward to seeing you soon on the road. Be safe. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Let's turn to slide number three. Today, I'd like to open with a few comments on our purpose-driven sustainability strategy, which is the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time. Secular sustainability megatrends continue to intensify. Climate change is causing more extreme weather events, which threaten vulnerable people and economies around the world. Scientists say it is still possible to meet the targets set under the Paris Agreement, but it is getting more difficult as time passes. We need to act today. That's what Trane Technologies is doing. We have set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets that continue to push our innovation further and faster. That innovation is transforming the way the world heats and cools buildings, improves indoor air quality, and safely transports food and medicine.\nAs we scale today's technology and innovate for tomorrow, we can dramatically reduce emissions and accelerate the world's progress. We are committed to making a difference, relentlessly and over the long term. This unyielding approach enables us to consistently outgrow our end markets, which in turn helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our team, our shareholders, and the planet. Moving to slide number four. Our global team delivered a strong close to 2021, despite persistent macro challenges related to cost inflation, tight supply chains, logistic markets, and labor availability that continue to restrict capacity and negatively impact productivity. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 27% bookings growth, 11% organic revenue growth, and 32% adjusted EPS growth.\nThis includes approximately $80 million of $150 million of revenue that was pushed out of the third quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance range of $50 to 75 million. On balance, 2021 was another very strong year for us, with record performance across key financial metrics. Bookings, revenue, backlog, EBITDA margins, and adjusted EPS all hit record levels. Price realization also reached record levels, demonstrating the power of our business operating system, and enabling us to more than neutralize the impact of widespread and persistent inflation for the year. With record demand for our innovative products and services, and backlog nearly double the level it was at this time last year, we are extremely well positioned for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate macro challenges to continue to constrain capacity and to negatively impact productivity, and those impacts are reflected in our revenue and EPS guidance.\nThey are also reflected in how we're thinking about the cadence of the year, with the second half expected to be much stronger than the first half. With continued strong demand and supply constrained by the macro environment, we expect backlog to remain at elevated levels throughout 2022 and into 2023. Please turn to slide number five. Looking at our initial guidance for 2021, we effectively met or exceeded all of our targets and delivered another year of strong financial performance. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth, 140 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 37% adjusted EPS growth. We also delivered strong free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to slide number six.\nOur relentless investments in innovation and our unwavering focus on serving our customers enables us to deliver consistently strong performance and differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. Demand for sustainable solutions continues to accelerate, and our innovation leadership is positioning us to outperform end markets. This will only intensify as the world decarbonizes. We're confident our leadership in sustainable innovation will continue to deliver differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns into the future. Please turn to slide number seven. In addition to our financial metrics, our ESG performance is core to our purpose and our strategy. Beginning in 2021, we revised our annual incentive compensation plan for approximately 2,300 leaders to link directly to ESG metrics, including reducing carbon emissions and increasing the diversity of our workforce.\nThese metrics are on our glide path to achieving our 2030 sustainability commitments, and I am happy to report that we exceeded each milestone in 2021. Job well done by the team. Please turn to slide number eight. Customer demand for our climate-focused innovation continues to grow. We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings growth, with growth across all segments. Customer demand was high throughout 2021, with organic bookings up 27% for both the quarter and the year, driving record backlog in each segment entering 2022. Organic revenues were also strong, up 11% for the quarter and the year. Overall, bookings growth far exceeded revenue growth, which was in part constrained by global supply chain and other macro challenges referenced earlier. Our Americas commercial HVAC business delivered robust bookings growth in the quarter, with orders up mid-20s.\nStrength was broad-based, with applied, unitary, and service each up more than 20%. Demand for comprehensive end-to-end indoor air quality solutions remained strong, and contributed to high single-digit organic revenue growth in Commercial HVAC Americas. The residential HVAC markets also remained strong, and our residential HVAC team delivered bookings growth over 30%. Revenues were up mid to high teens in the quarter, adding to growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sell-through across our channels was also strong, up high teens. With full-year organic bookings up over 70% and full-year organic revenues up over 30%, our Americas transport refrigeration business significantly outperformed the North America transport markets. During the fourth quarter, we extended our 2022 order book through the third quarter of 2022, which contributed to bookings growth of more than 40%.\nWe continue to thoughtfully manage our 2022 order book in order to mitigate inflationary risks. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was consistent with full-year growth, up 30%. Turning to AMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. Our AMEA teams delivered 13% organic bookings growth in the quarter, with strong growth in both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. With full-year organic bookings up over 40%, and full-year organic revenues up over 20%, our AMEA transport refrigeration business significantly outperformed the markets in 2021. During the quarter, AMEA transport refrigeration bookings and revenues were both up high teens. Our Asia-Pacific team delivered strong bookings growth of 18% and revenue growth of 4%, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by both strong volume and continued strong price execution of over 5% incremental price. Turning to margins, price over material inflation was modestly positive in the quarter, capping full-year positive price cost. Productivity was significantly impacted by continued supply chain, logistics, and labor availability challenges, which were exacerbated in recent weeks with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In addition, we continue to make strong incremental business reinvestments. Net, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins improved 30 and 10 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EPS grew 32%, driven primarily from a higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to slide number ten. We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page.\nThe dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments as we've highlighted here, with strong price realization, incremental business reinvestments, and innovation, and macro challenges impacting productivity and cost inflation as consistent drivers. Both the Americas and AMEA segments delivered higher revenues with modest margin declines. Margins were impacted by the macro challenges we've outlined. For the full year, both Americas and AMEA segments delivered strong margin expansion, with EBITDA margins expanding 100 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively. Our Asia-Pacific segment delivered good leverage and margin expansion in the quarter, with EBITDA margins expanding 170 basis points for the full year. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 11. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through relentless innovation for our customers. Our unwavering focus on solving our customers' most complex problems, compounded by the strength in underlying market conditions, powered the business forward in 2021 and yielded record backlog entering 2022. End markets continue to improve, with a multitude of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. GDP forecasts remain strong, unemployment is low, and indicators like Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February, remain largely favorable. Demand remains strong in data center, warehouse, education, and healthcare. We're benefiting from increased demand across our K through 12 customers, with federal stimulus funds supporting both current and future growth.\nWe see this as a multi-year tailwind for our business, given our strong position in the education market and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. Demand for our residential products was unprecedented in 2021, contributing to record revenue. Looking at 2022, we see tailwinds from record backlog entering the year, and expect strong price realization. We see headwinds from lapping tough growth compares from 2021. I'm proud of our residential team that has continued to meet customer demand while ramping capacity after a February weather event in our Texas facility. The team remains on track for capacity expansion in advance of the 2022 cooling season. Turning to Americas transport, we significantly outgrew strong end markets in 2021, as we outlined earlier. ACC continues to project continued market growth through their forecast horizon of 2023.\nI'll talk more about the transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to AMEA, while we have muted expectations for market growth, demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remains strong, and we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth. Our transport refrigeration business significantly outgrew end markets, delivering over 20% full-year revenue growth as compared to 13% market growth in the region. Turning to Asia, we expect growth in China in 2022, supported by strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with COVID-related partial lockdowns still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales force model is differentiated in the region and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in equipment and services. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our guidance for 2022. Chris.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 12. Based on the market backdrop Dave just outlined, and our strong backlog entering the year, we expect to deliver strong financial performance in 2022, with high single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS between $6.95 and $7.15. Our operating leverage outlook of approximately 20% contemplates a stronger second half, with improving macro dynamics, particularly around inflation and an improving supply chain. We expect price cost to be slightly positive for the year, but negative through the first half as we lap strong price and more modest inflation from the first half of 2021. The macro environment remains dynamic, and we expect tight supply chains, logistics, and labor availability to restrain revenue growth and margins, especially in the first half of the year. We expect free cash flow to remain strong at equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income.\nOur outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues, which is at the high end of our typical 1% to 2% range. Relentless incremental business reinvestment is never episodic for us, and it's how we innovate ahead of the competition year after year. Entering 2022, we are planning incremental investments in high ROI projects in support of our profitable growth objectives and our 2030 sustainability commitments. These high ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency, as well as investments to further decarbonize our operations. Our free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth. Given inherent challenges in accurately forecasting FX rates and the fact that we're transparent about our organic bookings and revenue each quarter, our guidance excludes potential FX impacts.\nOur FX exposure is largely translational in nature, and each point of revenue would translate at approximately OI rates. Net, as a reference, each point of negative FX would translate into about $0.05 of EPS headwind. Please turn to slide number 13. While we traditionally provide annual guidance, given a dynamic macroeconomic environment, we believe it may be constructive to provide an outlook for the first quarter based on what we expect to see today. Based on backlog, orders, and the dynamic macro backdrop we've outlined, we currently expect organic revenues to grow in the low to mid single-digit range, with flattish unit volumes, and strong price realization. First quarter margins are expected to be challenged due to negative incremental price cost dynamics, considering very strong price versus cost in the first quarter of 2021.\nYou'll recall we were able to get well ahead of inflation in the first quarter with strong price realization, which was part of the reason we were able to deliver very high operating leverage of nearly 50% in Q1 2021. Inflation was relatively modest in the first quarter of 2021 and really began to ramp aggressively in the third and fourth quarters. We exited Q4 with peak price and peak cost for 2021, with price at unprecedented levels of more than 5%. Net, while we expect to carry over strong pricing from the fourth quarter of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022, we're also lapping strong price from Q1 2021, which dampens the incremental carryover price.\nLikewise, we expect to carry over peak inflation from the fourth quarter of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022, but to lap more modest inflation from the first quarter of 2021. The equation is a bit more complex than this, but to keep it simple, this essentially means that we'll see almost the full impact of the carryover inflation. The end result is we expect to be upside down on price costs in the first quarter by $30 million to $40 million. This pricing dynamic improves as we move through 2022, and additional pricing actions taken in 2022 come online and are realized. As we've outlined, macro challenges related to supply chain, tight logistics, and labor constraints, exacerbated by the Omicron variant, are expected to negatively impact productivity.\nWhile it's difficult to predict the negative impact on productivity in a very dynamic environment, we expect a considerable impact in the first quarter. All in, our outlook is for adjusted operating income to be down approximately $35 million year over year in Q1 as we work to balance all the pieces. As we discussed on the prior slide, our full year outlook contemplates a stronger second half with easing inflation, and an improving macro environment. We'll update this outlook as the year goes along. There are a couple of items for Q1 that I also wanted to highlight to help with your models. First, interest expense is expected to be approximately $56 million, reflecting 2021 debt retirements. The other item I'd highlight is the estimated Q1 adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 17%, which we've assumed is flat with 2021.\nThe Q1 tax rate is traditionally low, impacted by higher stock-based compensation in the quarter. The full year 2021 guidance remains 19% to 20%. Please go to slide number 14. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings in high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio, as discussed earlier. Please go to slide number 15. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.\nOur balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide 16, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2021 and our outlook for 2022. During 2021, we deployed $2.4 billion in cash, with approximately $1.4 billion to M&A and share repurchases. We paid $561 million in dividends, and $425 million to pay down debt. Looking to 2022, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash, inclusive of $350 million in share repurchases we executed in January of 2022. Our outlook also includes our announcement that we intend to raise the quarterly dividend to $2.68 per share annualized. When combined with the dividend increase of 11% in 2021, the annual dividend is expected to be up 26% since launching as a pure play climate control business in March 2020.\nOur strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 18. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes providing an update on the transport refrigeration markets. Both Americas and AMEA had robust market growth in 2021, and our Thermo King businesses thrived. We pushed through macro challenges and significantly outgrew the markets in both regions. On the left side of the slide, you can see that the North America trailer, truck, and APU markets combined grew 19%, while Thermo King Americas grew more than 30%. In AMEA, market growth for trailer and truck combined was 17%, while Thermo King AMEA also grew more than 30%.\nOn the right side of the slide in the highlighted box, you can see that the total weighted average market growth for the Americas and AMEA transport refrigeration markets in 2021 was 15% and 13%, respectively. Thermo King growth for the Americas and AMEA was more than 30% and more than 20%, respectively. We're extremely pleased with the tremendous market outgrowth each of these businesses delivered in 2021. Market projections for 2023 call for continued growth in both regions, with particular strength continuing in North America. There is one other important dynamic I'd like to highlight while we're discussing transport refrigeration and moving into 2022. Our teams delivered tremendous booking growth in both regions in 2021, as we discussed on slide 8. Our bookings growth was more than twice our revenue growth, even as our revenue growth far exceeded the growth of our end markets, resulting in record backlogs.\nNet, we expect this dynamic to result in bookings declines during the year as we work through backlog extending well into 2022 and go up against tough compares every quarter. We'll highlight these dynamics with our earnings calls for transparency as we move through 2022. Please go to slide number 19. We added a second transport refrigeration slide to the deck last quarter to add more color around the North America trailer market from both backward and forward-looking perspectives. We're not going to spend a lot of time on it today, but we think it's a helpful reference slide for additional transparency. ACT continues to call for a nine-year average for North America trailers in the mid-40,000 unit range through 2023, with the pandemic in 2020 being the only significant outlier. Please go to slide number 20. Energy efficiency, decarbonization, and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger.\nWe are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging, uplifting culture. Despite a number of persistent macro challenges, 2021 was a record year for us, with top quartile EPS growth, accompanied by strong free cash flow and balanced capital deployment. We're seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our products and services, and our backlog has never been stronger. We're executing our business operating system well and expect to continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset. We believe we have the fundamental ingredients to deliver strong performance across the board in 2022 and beyond, and to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, as your question, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad, and please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up question. Our first question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Andy. How are you doing? Good morning.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGood. How are you? David, Chris, can you give us more color into how you're thinking about Trane's ability to offset other inflation outside of material cost with productivity? That seemed to be a pretty big swing factor in terms of margin headwind in Q4, and it obviously is pressuring Q1 and 2022. How much was the impact on Q4? What's the impact in Q1? I assume you're thinking in the additional headwinds on labor from Omicron over the last few weeks into Q1, and how are you thinking about that for 2022?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I'll start, Andy. I think going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see challenges on the supply chain front in terms of driving spot buys, inefficiencies in our plant and factory operations. With our Q4 guide of leverage around mid-teens, we really kind of landed right around that guide. I think leverage in the quarter was around 14%. We landed right where we thought we would land. In the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit more price on the realization side. We saw a little bit more inflation as well in the fourth quarter. Those both continue to ramp. We did see negative productivity over other inflation in the fourth quarter, and we're anticipating that for the first half of 2022 as well. The supply chain constraints are real. We're managing through them day by day, week by week.\nRight now, what we see is the second half of the year looks to be stronger in terms of supply chain resiliency and ultimately getting some of the supply chain back on track. It's a balance we're working each and every day.\nYeah, Andy, the only thing I would add is that in our plants right now, with the supply chain constraints, and I could talk more about that after, it's very, very disruptive. Okay? If you were a plant manager, if you've ever had the opportunity to be a plant manager, anyone on the line, you know what I was talking about. We're constantly having to reschedule, rebalance lines, pulling line-side inventory and replacing it with other line-side inventory, rescheduling employees. This is a plant manager's kind of nightmare.\nThe good thing is we have great plant managers, and we're working through it, but it is disruptive. It's been disruptive for some time now. As Chris said, we anticipate this disruption to continue, certainly through the first quarter and the first half.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nIt's helpful, guys. David, I think you mentioned before that you expect your residential track business to be a GDP plus business going forward and in 2022, I think. With residential bookings still up 30% in Q4, capacity up, strong pricing, I know you talked about tough comps. How are you thinking about the business in 2022? Does it have the potential to grow in line with the company, or how are you viewing inventory in the channel at this point?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, great question, Andy. We do see our residential business over time being a GDP plus business.\nI just remind everyone that our Residential HVAC business is about 20% of our total business. We had a very strong fourth quarter. I mean, revenue in the fourth quarter for our Residential HVAC business was up 17%, 17%, and our bookings were up over 30%. The Residential HVAC business is performing well. I'm really proud of what that team has been able to do, ramping up the facility in Tyler, Texas after a freak weather event. The customer mindset there and the ability for them to ramp up and serve the customer is some of the best I've seen in our company. As far as the Residential HVAC markets go, you're going to see we'll see growth in new construction, which is a smaller portion of our business.\nWe do not expect the replacement market, which is the larger part of our business, to fall off a cliff. Our resume business will be up against tough comps, as you said, all year. With that said, we have a strong backlog, market-leading brands, and we will see strong price all year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Andy, Katie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian. How are you?\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood, thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nVery good.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe just wanted to circle back on the sort of EPS seasonality through the year. You gave very clear Q1 guidance. When I say the Q1 works out to being around a low teens share of the full-year earnings, not too different versus history, but you kept emphasizing a sort of challenging first half.\nWhen we think about the first half, should we assume it's around a sort of mid-forties share of full-year earnings? Is that roughly the right ballpark with sort of price costs getting a little bit less bad in Q2?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Julian, Chris, I'll start. First quarter where we're dialing in the guide around $0.95 to $1, that would put it around 14% to the full year. Q1 would be around 14% versus the full year at the midpoint. That's actually a little better than what our average has been over the last four to five years. That average is around 12%. We're seeing it to be a little bit stronger on the full year, but I think it's hard to tell what we think the second quarter will fully be at this point.\nWe continue to work the supply chain challenges, and as we see it, this is not a demand concern. The demand is absolutely there. This is really a supply chain and how do we navigate through it. We'll provide some more guidance when we get through our first quarter call and what we think for Q2. We definitely see from the supply chain aspects that the second half of the year is easing in terms of supply logistics and some of the labor constraints as well.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful, thank you. Just my second one around commercial HVAC revenue trends in 2022. Should we think about the Americas having kind of the strongest growth of the three regions in commercial HVAC this year, and maybe any color on how you see the new construction market in non-resume in the US this year?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I'll join.\nHow are you doing this day? Look, our commercial business performed very well in the Americas all year in 2021, with broad-based strength in Q4 across unitary, applied, and service. All of them were up over 20%. The team is seeing tremendous demand. As far as the end markets go, you have low unemployment, strong underlying GDP growth, and ABI has been positive for the last 11 months, which are above 50, which means positive. Again, that's a six to nine-month lag on that metric. That's a good foreshadowing as to what to expect in the future. We have particularly strong strength in the data centers vertical, warehousing, healthcare, and education. We're starting to see nice growth in the office vertical. Indoor air quality and decarbonization of the built environment will continue to be tailwinds for us.\nWe'll have a strong year in our commercial HVAC business, and we have some nice tailwinds behind us, and that business will continue to execute. Our constraint there will not be the markets. It will be back to the supply chain. Specifically in the first half, as we're starting to get some visibility into the second half, some of those supply constraints, specifically around electronic components, will start to ease.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh. How are you doing? Good morning.\n\nJoshua Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, thanks. Just wondering what got worse on the inflation front sequentially for Q1 to Q2. I know some of the metals are sort of rolling off. There's probably an inventory dynamic that gets in the way in realizing that near term.\nPutting aside kind of the year-over-year tyranny of the math, it sounds like things actually got maybe a little bit worse. Anything you'd call out specifically that we should be kind of watching more closely?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Josh, it's Chris. Yeah, in the fourth quarter, I would say price was a little better than where we started the quarter, and also inflation wound up being a little higher as well. Part of this is the inefficiencies we're seeing around spot buys and expedited freight to ultimately serve customers. As I think carrying over Q4 into Q1, we're seeing roughly the same levels of inflation in the fourth quarter carrying over into the first quarter.\nYou may recall we look at commodities and have a hedging practice and strategy in place for copper and aluminum, which will roll out really over 12 months, but it really smooths the impact of inflation. Going into any one quarter, we'd have about 70% to 75% of that price already hedged. I would say the impacts of the fourth quarter really start to be very similar to the impacts in the first quarter there. Steel, roughly the same way. We have about a six-month lag on our steel purchasing from when we lock in prices to when we would see any price changes. Any dynamics now in January we're seeing in steel would really be realized in the second half of the year. That's how we're kind of playing out from Q4 to Q1.\n\nJoshua Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful.\nJust on the commercial side, we've had some of these kind of broader market initiatives in your own, whether it's indoor air quality or some of the more sustainability-focused products. Really been out there in the marketplace for a while now and customers taking hold. What are you guys watching today to kind of track that in earnest and maybe disaggregate normal replacement-type demand in commercial from some of the spicier stuff you guys have put out over the past couple of years?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, good question, Josh. I mean, first of all, I'll start with IAQ, right? IAQ, indoor air quality. We continue to see a tailwind from that. We had a very good year in 2021. We expect to have another good year in 2022.\nStill getting a lot of demand out there for indoor air quality audits, as well as what we call day two activity, which is helping our customers build out the infrastructure for long-term improvements with an energy consumption in line of sight there. As far as decarbonization of the built environment, as we call it, we're in the very, very early innings, and the intensity there is growing every day. We've talked a lot about what we're doing in Europe there with the electrification of heating. That is, again, just to remind everyone, it's really not just a heat pump. It's a system that's combining a chiller and a boiler plant together into one system. We're not only seeing great traction in Europe there, we're also seeing that in Americas. Those are in the early innings.\nWe track activity for both indoor air quality as well as on decarbonization pretty closely. It's getting harder to blend the two together. Those are going to continue. You have the core business that kind of is going to follow what we would say is more traditional, right? We obviously look at what's happening with new construction, and Dodge is still actively forecasting pretty robust demand in 2022. That's a good sign. As I said earlier, Architectural Billing Index is probably one of the, has probably some of the highest correlation of what the future is going to be for our commercial HVAC business. That's been over 50 now for 11 months. That bodes well for the future as well.\n\nJoshua Pokrzywinski\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks.\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Jeff, did you survive the storm up in Connecticut?\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Vertical Research\n\nI did. All good up here. Putting the four-wheelers to work.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nUnfortunately, we had to use some four-wheelers here in Charlotte too.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Vertical Research\n\nYeah, I'm sure it's a little scary on the roads down there. We know how to drive up here, though. Hey, Dave, I think kind of implicit in you acknowledging the orders will roll down now on the comps and the like, right? Would also then obviously suggest that people have ordered further out to get their place in line and that sort of thing. Really, the nature of my question is, to what extent were people able to place orders in advance of your price increases, or have you been able to fully protect yourself on kind of the cost coming through the inventory channel and the backlog?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, it's a good question for sure. First of all, let me start with the order rates, okay? For many of our products, we do have extended lead times right now. We do have customers that are ordering early by definition. I would also tell you that we're working very closely with our customers, and they want to give us as much visibility as possible. They understand what's happening with supply chain, so they're asking us to make sure that we get spots secured for them in the future. I'd say we are getting orders in earlier. You see that in our robust bookings numbers. I wouldn't get overly concerned with it. It's not like we're pulling in orders from a year and a half out, okay? We're talking a few months here.\nAs far as pricing is concerned in the backlog, at the end of the day, you really have to go through it by business. In our residential business, for example, we reprice the backlog. If we have a price increase, we'll reprice the backlog. In our commercial business, some of our orders actually have price elasticity built into those based on certain indices. Depending on when it's going to ship, it'll be at a higher price vis-à-vis if it's shipped today. That's normal, and we've been doing that for a long time. The days of there's going to be a price increase, let me double order or order as much as I can to get in front of it, I think we've, I mean, it certainly happened a little bit. A lot of that behavior has been changed.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Vertical Research\n\nDave, can you provide a little bit more color on how you think resume plays out, right? You said you do not envision it falling off a cliff. How do you see it playing? Is there maybe some gamesmanship around the efficiency change? You just said people do not pre-buy anymore, so perhaps you are not expecting that. Just kind of the overall trajectory of resume as you see it over the course of the year here.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I do. As far as the pre-buy for the regulation change and efficiency change in 2022, there could be some of that activity. We do not see it to be anything alarming. We will update everyone as we see that starting to unfold as the year goes forward. As far as the end markets go in resume, 2021 was a very robust year. Fourth quarter was very strong for us.\nI'm very encouraged with order rates up over 30% in the fourth quarter. Residential new construction, as I said earlier, will be positive, right? I mean, there's a lot of metrics out around that. That'll probably be in the low single digits positive, although that's a small percentage of our business, about 20%. The replacement market, about 80% of our business, we don't see it falling off a cliff, okay? Could unit volume be down a point or two? Sure. I also would tell you that we're going to see strong price all year in resume.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Scott. How are you?\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm great. Thank you. I'm kind of curious just following up on Jeff's question.\nIn new construction, it was always the builders would buy kind of the cheapest unit out there. Is there a change in some buying patterns? Are guys buying higher efficiency and trying to sell the environmental benefits and stuff like that? Are they able to capture any value on the home building side if they upgrade? Is it still kind of similar as the past?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, it's a great question. Again, it's a smaller part of our business, only about 20%. We certainly talked to many of the home builders, many of the large home builders. What you just described, they're very interested in. We'll see if they act on that. They're very interested conceptually on being able to have a greener home, for lack of better terms, and being able to sell that to their customer.\nBecause we're so small, it'd be hard to where we're selling, we sell some high-tier into that market. It'd be interesting to see if some of the larger players actually act on what they talk a lot about.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Dave, back to kind of the common question we're getting right now from folks is just about the integrity of backlogs. Historically, the larger the down payment and the higher the integrity of the backlog. Has the dynamic changed with the customer base at all? Can you capture more upfront to get people and kind of secure them spots in line that perhaps capture a little bit of a premium on the supply and demand imbalance that's occurring right now?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, at the end of the day, we think the integrity of our backlog is quite strong, okay? Let me tell you why.\nIn our resume business with our independent wholesale distributors, technically, they can't cancel orders. We don't see that backlog going away. We do see a small amount of maybe double ordering from dealers, but it's insignificant in respect to a $5.4 billion backlog. In commercial HVAC, we're dealing with complex systems, highly engineered products, and working closely with engineers, architects, and end customers. You may see a job site delay, but you're not going to see duplicate orders. In Thermo King, we're working closely with our customers, and we're matching their demand with other OEMs, whether it be on the trailer side or the tractor side. All of us are working together to make sure that we can combine the solution for the customer, and everything gets there at the same time. We don't see those orders being canceled as well.\nOverall, we think the backlog is strong. As far as your question about demanding more money upfront, we're not doing that, certainly in the Americas or in EMEA. That has always been a practice in parts of Asia, which we do. We're not going out and demanding cash from our customers because of the incredible amount of demand that we're seeing. That's not what Trane Technologies is about. We want to solve our customers' most complex problems and work with them. That's what we'll continue to do in the future.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nSounds good, Dave. Good luck. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joe. How are you?\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll good. Thanks, Dave. Just maybe we'll start off on this price cost question.\nChris, the $30 to $40 million headwind in Q1, whatever details you can give us on how that's supposed to look for the rest of the quarters throughout the year, and then specifically on pricing, I'm just curious, what are you baking into resume pricing in 2022?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Joe. I'm going to start with the second question first. On pricing, just to remind you, we had about three price increases across the majority of our portfolio in 2021. Really an unprecedented level of price. On a full-year basis, it's 3.5 points of price at the enterprise level across the company, so really very, very strong. We have announced and in place what I'll call the first price increase of 2022 that really started here in January, and that applied to the majority of our products.\nIt's based on the inflation that we see today. As nimble as we were last year, and I think we saw the industry follow, we're going to remain nimble as we go through the year as we kind of evaluate inflation. On the price cost dynamic, exactly. We're carrying over significant price from the fourth quarter into Q1. We're carrying over a significant level of inflation that nearly offset the price in the fourth quarter. We were slightly price cost positive in Q4. We see that right now being a negative in the first quarter and likely negative on the first half. Again, in the first quarter last year, we saw very strong price. We got ahead of the market and competition in terms of the timing of our price announcements. We had some very modest inflation in the first quarter last year.\nThat helped drive that near 50% leverage in the first quarter a year ago. We're going to, unfortunately, lap against very modest inflation in Q1. We see inflation for the year. It's really a mirror image of 2021. 2022 is. The first half of 2022 is going to look a lot like the second half of 2021 in terms of the inflation. We start comping in the second half of the year to much more modest inflation or comparable inflation starting in the third quarter. I think right now our best view is we're probably price cost negative in the first half, and then it returns to really very good strength in the second half of the year and strong leverage.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nChris, maybe just following up on that point in the second half, we've talked about inflation, but how are you guys thinking about cost curves coming down in the second half? Are you baking in deflation into your numbers in Q2 as part of the guide?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, I'd say we're not baking a whole lot of deflation into the guide, Joe, to be fair. I mean, I look at copper and aluminum futures, and they're pretty narrow from now until the balance of the year. I don't see a lot of deflation there. What's starting to show a bit of deflationary impacts is steel. Let's see where it goes. At this point, if we start seeing deflation there, that would really impact us starting six months out from today, just based on our buying habits and our locking in a steel price for six months.\nIt turns out we start seeing a deflationary environment, which we're not counting on. If we start to see that, then we'll see how that plays out in the second half of the year. That could be a tailwind then.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThanks, Joe. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHey, guys. How's it going?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Joel. How are you? Congratulations. I hear that retirement is in your future. Congratulations, and thanks for all your great coverage of Trane Technologies and Ingersoll Rand through the years. We certainly appreciate it, and we'll miss you.\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nYeah. Well, let me see if I'm going to be any good at it or not.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nWell, we'll get you some fishing rods, okay?\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nYeah, there you go. Just two longer-term kind of questions.\nI wonder if you can talk a little bit about any factors, kind of, I don't know, being the new guy and all that kind of stuff. Looking over the next five years or so, what are the factors you see that could really cap the upside on your operating and your EBITDA margins? What do you have to work on today to make sure that there's no bottlenecks five years out?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Joel, it's a great question. It really has to do with ensuring that you're continuously investing in innovation for the long term. You heard Chris talk a little about it. Even though we know the first half of this year is going to be tough, right? We're going to struggle through supply chain constraints. We got a mirror image hitting us with inflation.\nWe'll have strong price, but we'll have some carryover strong price as well. We know the first half will be tough. What we're not going to do in the first half is we're not going to cut our investments because we know that's about our long term. Really, where we see this is the whole decarbonization of what's happening and our products about making this world a better place for next generations. That's our purpose. That's what we're committed to, and you're going to continue to see that from Trane Technologies. I had a call the other day with some ESG investors, and they asked me what I was most proud of for ESG for Trane Technologies. I thought about it for a minute. It caught me a little bit off guard.\nI'm proud of the fact that Trane Technologies was green before it was cool to be green. We've been working at this for a long time. Since 2013, we had our first set of science-based targets. We now have our second set of science-based targets. We are committed to making a difference, and we're going to do that through our innovation. We're challenging what's possible, and it's going to be tremendous upside for Trane Technologies over the long term.\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nLast, can you just give us a little sense of maybe it's kind of a little far out there also, but what are the impacts on the transport business from trucks turning to EV?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies",
    "content2": "Electrification is a big part of our strategy there, Joel. Once again, you're on top of your game there.\nYeah, we have, in fact, we have a couple or a unit that's going up and down the highways. If you're in California, you may see it. That is a trailer unit that is 100% electric. We have a lot of really neat innovation we're working on there. Our customers are loving it. The data that we've been able to extract from the unit as it's going up and down the highway is tremendous for our engineers to continue to develop. Anyways, think about EV vehicles. Think about Thermo King as, once again, staying ahead of the market there with electrification of our products. We have some really neat products that we came out with about, I guess, it's 18 months ago now in the home delivery. We're getting a lot of traction, a lot of tractions around the globe with those products. All right.\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right, Joel. Good luck to you, okay?\n\nJoel Tiss\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nAll right. Congratulations.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nHey, good morning, guys. This is Pat on for Steve. My first one's on the commercial HVAC business. Can you break down your organic growth expectations for this year between what you expect for services versus equipment? Then within that equipment piece, unitary versus global pod, if possible.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Pat, it's Chris. I'll start. Look, we expect strong growth, equipment, and services on a full-year basis. As we've talked in the past, applied orders and install-based drives a nice service tailwind. Just given our orders and backlog that we have in 2021 carrying over into 2022, we expect the services business to grow as well. I'd leave it at that for now.\nWe'll kind of update as we go quarter by quarter, which we typically do to highlight the growth in each of the categories. We've got some good growth planned for both this year.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThe only thing I would add, Pat, this is Dave, is our service business performed very well all year in 2021. In the fourth quarter, order rates for service were up over 20%. I don't expect it to grow at 20%, but we've seen very, very nice growth for our service business. Really, not just in commercial HVAC, but in our commercial HVAC on a global basis, nice service growth. A lot of that is on intelligent services as well. This would be with our connected solutions, and that side of the business is growing very nicely for us. Okay. I had to try.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nOn the first quarter and first half versus second half dynamics, I may have missed this, but did you say if any particular end market drives the slow start in volume growth? In resi specifically, do you think there's going to be much difference between first half versus second half growth dynamics?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, just to be clear, the first half, what's constraining growth in the first half isn't the end markets. It's the supply chain, and specifically, it's components within the supply chain, which is really around electronics. It's not end markets. As you see through the fourth quarter, our end markets continue to accelerate, which is a good sign. I wouldn't think of it as, as Chris outlined, we got some tough comps in the first quarter of the first half. We got inflation rolling over.\nWe have price rolling over, but we also have some tough comparison against price. We will have a choppy supply chain, at least through the first half of the year. We see some light through the clouds there as we head into the second half of the year.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nGotcha. That supply chain impacts resi and commercial and transport kind of equally is what you're kind of saying?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nI think it unfortunately affects most industrial companies.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nYep. Makes sense. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure. No problem, Pat. Thanks, Pat.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Andrew Oben with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. This is Emily Shewan for Andrew Oben.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHi, Emily. How are you? Hey, good morning.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nHey, I'm good. I had a question on IAQ.\nYou had previously guided to IAQ being one to two points of additional revenue growth tailwind per year. Does that still stick? Where do you expect that to land in 2022? Have you seen any momentum in demand for IAQ products given the Omicron surge? Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. We said early last year that we thought revenue would be in the 1% to 2% tailwind from IAQ. It would be a little bit north of 2%, actually. The year ended up very well for our indoor air quality solutions. Remember, indoor air quality is not new to Trane Technologies. We've been in it for quite some time. We have launched several new initiatives there, especially on the audit side and what we call day one, day two. We're going to continue to see tailwinds from indoor air quality.\nI wouldn't expect 2% to compound every year. We do expect to see nice tailwinds from indoor air quality, and we're seeing a backlog that continues to grow. I would tell you that it's probably harder to count because these indoor air quality solutions are becoming embedded into our equipment. Think of it as like a unit controller in a unitary piece of equipment, right? Indoor air quality is just becoming part of the systems. With that said, we continue to push the envelope there. We've got some great innovation in the pipeline, really cool things we're doing with our transit bus business and Thermo King, and we're still making a lot of traction with dry hydrogen peroxide as well as some of our photocatalytic solutions.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nAwesome. What kind of visibility do you have on the already passed federal stimulus for K-12 education?\nFor example, are there any projects we can sort of trace back to stimulus funding? Or do you have a sense of the scope of how much stimulus has been spent on HVAC since the bills were passed? Thanks.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I don't know if I get that specific, but I would tell you that we have a dedicated Tiger team that works on this. We know how the funding is flowing, and there's a lot of restrictions as you dig into the detail. You may know this, you may not, but some of the stimulus funds have to be going to the education side versus just the infrastructure side. We're working with our customers, helping them navigate those dynamics that exist there. Absolutely, we are seeing the funding going all the way through to the local school districts.\nWe're there with our customers on day one, helping them on what they could do. Day two, actually helping them deploy capital on what they should be doing over the long term.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, John. How are you? Good morning.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nDoing well, thank you. Hey, maybe just the first one as a clarification. When you were talking about the tough order comps, obviously, they're across the board. You did highlight that some of those product lines might see declines, I think. Just wanted to understand if that was an enterprise comment or specific to those particular product lines you called out.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, it's certainly going to be the case with our Thermo King business, okay?\nIf you think about it, I mean, our bookings rate last year was twice our order rate, right? Bookings up over 70%. That's not going to continue. We have a very strong backlog there, John. That will burn during the year. Do not be surprised if you see a quarter or two of negative bookings within Thermo King. You really need to combine incoming order rates with backlog and really be looking at what the output is through revenue. Yeah. Our view now, John, as we kind of look through the year, is ending 2022 and starting 2023 with a very strong backlog, well above what our historical level will be. To Dave's point, one or two quarters of some comping against some very strong order growth. We see by the end of the year that still being a very healthy backlog going into 2023.\nWe'll have tough comps in resi too, okay? Just so you're aware. Just on the backlog, I want to make sure everyone's clear. Our backlog will be $5.4 billion. It was at the end of the year. If you look at that as a percentage of our midpoint revenue guide, it's like 35%. In a normal year, your backlog would be like 20%. I mean, we have a very, very, very strong backlog for the year.\nGreat. No, appreciate that. Maybe just a quick one on uses of cash. Obviously, you called out the elevated spend for repo in January. How does the deal pipeline look as you're thinking about the balance of the year and toggling between share repo and M&A? Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, our M&A pipeline is robust.\nWe look at a lot of opportunities, as you would imagine, being a major HVAC player in the industry. We always have a full pipeline that we evaluate.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, John, I would add on the $1.9 billion to M&A and share repurchase. We did repurchase $350 million here in January. Let's say approximately $1.5 billion left to deploy in the year. From a modeling perspective, just given we can't identify yet how much is to be spent on M&A versus share repurchase, for our guidance, we just assumed the whole $1.5 billion remaining would be to share repurchase kind of radically over the remaining quarters of the year. We'll update everyone as we go quarter to quarter. Certainly, a preference would be to spend some value of that $1.5 billion on M&A.\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nNo problem. Thanks, sir.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from [Gotham Kana with Callan]. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst 3]\n\nAnalyst 3\n\nHi. Good morning, guys.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Gotham. How are you? Good morning.\n\n[Analyst 3]\n\nAnalyst 3\n\nDoing well. Doing well. Hey, I just wanted to follow up. I think it may have been Josh who asked a really good question on this. Can you talk a little bit about how in the commercial space, if at all, the business model is evolving? Customers concerned about ESG targets of their own, presumably utilizing HVAC as a tool to hit those targets, as opposed to just payback on energy savings or whatever as a stimulant to demand. Are you seeing performance contracts where if you can guarantee certain greenhouse reductions, you get paid for it? Just sort of the terms of the contract, are they changing in any meaningful way?\nDoes that maybe allow for some pricing power in commercial that didn't exist before?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat's a great question, Gotham. I would tell you that it's a great question. I would tell you that it's very, very early innings there. Obviously, there's a lot of questions. We're getting calls from customers and asking how we could help them decarbonize their built environment. One of the things we did, Gotham, that was maybe a little bit different than some is we actually went out and practiced on ourselves first. Part of our commitment is to reduce our own greenhouse gas. We're implementing best practices in many of our facilities as well so that we could take customers there and show them what we've done. You're certainly on to the decarbonization as a service type environment that is getting some traction.\nI would tell you it's very early innings, but it's getting traction.\n\n[Analyst 3]\n\nAnalyst 3\n\nJust as a follow-up, do you think it actually confers kind of greater pricing power in the commercial market? I mean, over time, than has been the case historically where we think of it being more competitive than in resi, for example? Yeah. I mean, if you have a concentration of the customers. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nIt's a fair question. I think we'll be able to write that chapter probably in the coming years here. I would tell you that whenever we've had products and services that have high efficiency, that have complex problems to solve for our customers, we tend to do very well.\n\n[Analyst 3]\n\nAnalyst 3\n\nAppreciate it, guys. Thank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nHey, Deane. How are you?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Doing real well. Thanks. I might have missed this, but did you size any revenue push out from Q4 into the first quarter that would be comparable to the 130 that got pushed out from Q3?\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. I mean, we did not, okay? You didn't miss anything. Obviously, we did have some revenue that pushed out from Q4 into future periods. It's probably in the same realm that we saw going from Q3 to Q4 in that $150 million range. One thing that's different there, in the fourth quarter, we had visibility working with our suppliers that we would recoup about half of that in the quarter. It would be the fourth quarter, which we did. We do not have that same visibility as we enter Q1. Obviously, we're not including that in our guide, not including the guide for the first quarter.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nIs that it? That's correct. That's correct. Got it. Obviously, the backlog will churn and it'll be within the year for sure, but not in the first quarter.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIs that mostly electronic components still? Yeah.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah. Electronic components is still the biggest concern we have. There have been some areas of supply chain that have improved, as I said earlier. Electronic components has got still, we still have some significant choppiness there.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Just last question from me on the increase in CapEx for the year. You referenced some higher returns. Can you size for us what kind of returns you're getting on these projects and maybe an example of your own decarbonization investment you're doing?\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nYeah, Dean, I think we see multiple categories kind of driving a little bit higher CapEx.\nAgain, still within our range of 1% to 2%, but right now expecting it to be closer to 2% in 2022. The categories would be around capacity expansion, driving further automation in the plants, supply chain resiliency projects here as we kind of manage through this transitionary year in 2022, improving front-end systems. Maybe one thing to highlight on the sustainability side is we take older pieces of machinery offline. There's examples where you've got three pieces of machinery in a factory that you're able to deploy one piece of machinery today just given improvements to technology and efficiency. For us, that should have a lower impact on the environment, a lower impact on energy usage. Those are the types of things we continue to lean in.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nDave, just stay.\nI was out at one of our factories in the Midwest, and they were showing me examples where they literally had four old pieces of equipment, and they took them out of service. These were old pieces of equipment that the prior mindset would have been, the asset's fully depreciated, I only run it 40% of the time, I don't need the space. We take those out, we put in a new piece of equipment, dramatically reduce the energy load in the facility. In many cases, you're able to increase throughput with a newer machine, with newer technology. It's just a great program that they're working through, as are many of our factories around the world. It's sort of what we're talking about all the time, don't wait for new, you don't need to wait for new technology.\nDeploy what's available today, and you're going to get significant benefit. It's the same, what we say is what we do. All sounds good.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Regnery\n\nCEO, Trane Technologies\n\nAll right.\nThank you.\nThanks.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Zach Nagel for any closing remarks.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, we'll be around for any questions that you may have between days and weeks, and we look forward to hopefully seeing many of you on the road in 2022. Thank you, and have a great day.\n\nChris Kuehn\n\nEVP and CFO, Trane Technologies\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."

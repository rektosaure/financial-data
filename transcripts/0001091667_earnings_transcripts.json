[Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Leila, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements.\nAs a reminder, all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. During the third quarter, we remained the fastest-growing mobile provider in the United States. We added nearly 500,000 spectrum mobile lines in the quarter and 2 million lines over the last 12 months, over 20% growth.\nOur video customer losses continued to improve to 70,000 less than 1/4 of last year's third quarter losses. That was driven by significant product improvements over the past 2 years. And Internet competition for new customers remains high, and our third quarter Internet customer losses were in line with last year.\nRevenue was down about 1% year-over-year, driven by customer losses and a challenging political advertising comparison. Third quarter EBITDA declined by 1.5% year-over-year, essentially flat when excluding advertising. The operating environment for new sales, in particular Internet continues to reflect low move rates and higher mobile substitution, along with both expanded cell phone Internet competition and fiber overlap growth similar to earlier in the year.\nCollectively, that drove third quarter Internet gross adds lower year-over-year. Churn improved year-over-year as to be expected given last year's ACP-related impacts and Internet churn, including nonpaid churn, remains at historically low levels. From a medium- and long-term growth perspective, we know we have the best network, fully capable over where we operate with increasing demand for bandwidth and we have great products to help us win and the ability to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year.\nIn the short term, with lower selling opportunities and new forms of competition, small changes in sales or churn have an outsized impact on Internet net gains. We're leaving no stone unturned to drive customer and financial growth, including improved customer perception of our branded products, growing mobile profitability, and driving streaming video growth, all with the focus to drive connectivity revenue growth.\nWe're also improving our long-term cost profile through our service and technology investments, including AI. Beginning with go-to-market, we remain focused on better ways to message our products and value savings, including our marketing and channel mix and testing new offers with international pricing and packaging structure. The new pricing and packaging we launched in September of last year produces a higher number of total products sold per Connect, a gig attach rate that has nearly doubled, more mobile lines per customer connect and a video sell-in rate that has improved substantially with lower customer churn from bundling.\nDespite lower selling opportunities given the macro backdrop, our yield on sales opportunities has steadily increased. And various new offer expressions in our marketing mix are designed to find audience and drive more traffic to digital and traditional sales channels, saving customers money without sacrificing our revenue or cash flow potential at the household level.\nOur marketing efforts, combined with our improving products, promotional and retail pricing and customer service have resulted in significant improvement in consumer perception scores over the past year. Our service is backed by the investment in our 100% U.S.-based sales and service workforce, increasing tenure of those employees in quality from better pay, benefits and technology investment coupled with our market-leading and industry-first customer commitment across our wireline and wireless services, which we back with service credits, including their outages, or if we can't be at your home or business, the same day for service or at least next day for installation.\nFor service visits, we're moving our internal standard to arrive at your doorstep within 2 hours of the service call, and we're now achieving that a large percentage of the time, all of which is helping to drive improved brand perception. In mobile, our broadband growth continues. And for the last 6 quarters, the majority of our line net adds have come from unlimited plus lines, which offer higher customer value and drives lower churn.\nWe've also been selling more mobile lines for Connect and additional lines to existing mobile households. Convergence reduces Internet churn and higher mobile lines per customer benefits turn further. Increasingly, the line between mobile and wireline connectivity is being blurred as our customers connect seamlessly between the 2 networks.\nOver the last 12 months, our total connectivity revenue grew by about 4%. And 21% of our Internet customers are now converged, meaning they buy both our mobile and Internet products. The profitability of our converged customers continues to grow. And we don't treat mobile as a separate product, but if we did, Slide 7 shows our fully loaded mobile service margin, excluding acquisition, and that's without the significant churn benefit to Internet.\nMobile's financial contribution continues to grow with our scale and a 20% reduction in our reliance on macro cell towers over the past 3 years. We are growing offload to faster networks, driven by the development of our Spectrum Mobile network with seamless authentication to nearly 50 million small cell towers through our advanced WiFi, CBRS deployment and partner cable networks.\nWith 88% of spectrum mobile device traffic now on our own network, the cable operators deliver more facilities-based traffic than the traditional mobile carriers. WiFi is essentially the backbone for all cellular traffic. And 5G macro cell towers are really our backup radios with lower speed and higher latency.\nWe continue to evolve our fiber-powered wireline network to deliver Internet service that offers more throughput, even less latency and greater reliability, all at a great value. Our network evolution initiative remains on track to deliver symmetrical and multi-gig speeds across our entire footprint with convergence everywhere we operate.\nIn early 2026, we'll launch our advanced WiFi complete product, a tri-band advanced WiFi 7 router that integrates 5G cellular and battery backup to keep customers seamlessly and fully connected during the service disruption or a power outage.\nWe've also announced new B2B partnerships that allow secure auto connection to the Spectrum Mobile network, starting with Amazon and Nexar, and we're exploring a wide range of B2B applications using the network assets highlighted on Slide 4 including lower cost and higher performance data transport, authentication services and other consumer-friendly uses of our capabilities. Our video product also continues to evolve and improve.\nEarlier this month, we announced the launch of our Spectrum app store, a digital marketplace where spectrum customers can discover, activate, manage and upgrade the apps included with respect from TV video plans. And non-video customers can purchase DTC video apps, a la carte. The store is accessible on my Spectrum app and on our website, spectrum.net. It's an important additional step in our effort to bring back utility and value to customers in the video ecosystem, really for the benefit of our connectivity services.\nWith the combination of over $125 of included video app value in our video product, unified search and discovery in Xumo and our digital marketplace, we're now more fully marketing our seamless entertainment packaging. Slide 9 shows our video customers are increasingly streaming customers through the award-winning Spectrum TV app and now included programmer streaming apps. Also, earlier this month, we announced that we are partnering with Apple to record and distribute a selection of immersive live Laker games starting in January.\nNow d don't go to Spectrum Internet and video customers in L.A., Nevada and Hawaii using the Spectrum SportsNet immersive app on the Apple VisionPro. The same will be distributed nationally the next day throughout our footprint and on the NBA immersive app. Experience is amazing, and you can see how immersive content will apply across next-generation devices in the future.\nAnd keep in mind that these immersive video streams filmed in 16k require consistent throughput of 150 megabits per second to the home even when distributed in 8-K for the AppliVisionPro. Our fiber-powered bandwidth-rich network is ideally suited to deliver these kinds of immersive experiences which requires significant throughput and benefit from lower latency. So we continue to believe the high-quality video product with value and utility customers and the development of these bandwidth-rich products can be yet another competitive advantage for our seamless connectivity products.\nVideo also remains a significant driver of lower customer churn, and it can help drive acquisition. And the partnerships we're recreating with programmers and the leagues, great benefits for all of us as we, for example, address the problem of where is my game. Most of what I've discussed this morning really relates to our products and how they'll -- help drive customer demand and revenue growth. But we're also deploying new technologies, which will transform the quality and economics of our $8 billion annual cost to serve.\nFor years, we've meaningfully improved the quality of our service while reducing service calls and truck rolls often at a double-digit rate annually. We've reinvested those savings into frontline employee wages and benefits as well as technology and tools to enhance the quality of our service interactions with customers, both of which have meaningfully improved service employee tenure and career progression.\nJust a few of the currently deployed tools that we have include machine learning and AI for our network and in-home telemetry to identify and address service issues before they ever occur. Even more so with the deployment of signal in power transponders, which will occur as part of our network evolution initiative. Another example is our unified front end for agents with real-time call transcription, beating our AI models for what we call next Best Action presentment to the agent based on hundreds of real-time and historical metrics.\nThat front end also integrates our spectrum GPT capabilities for the agent, which will move from current text to conversational prompting. Our AI-based customer sentiment measurement includes supervisor tools to flag real-time agent support and subsequent agent-specific training modules. Our service calls also now have AI call summarization presented on call transfers or subsequent calls and for field techs on job arrival. We're also integrating network telemetry and AI will prompt next Best Action and coaching for the field of maintenance techs as well.\nAnd you can imagine the upcoming positive effects of AI in areas like network monitoring, dispatch in workforce planning. These are just a few isolated examples often seamless to our employees as it simply improves their job and it improves the service experience. And Charter, these tools are all supported by the same unified data set and tools development within our centralized operating model.\nAll of that reflects where we are today and in the coming months. But just over the past few months, -- we've seen rapid investments in Agentic AI technology, such that we're focusing our efforts with a few key partners going into 2026 to integrate our existing capabilities into a more agentic service. The recent advancements most relevant to us include short- and long-term memory, handling multiple customer issues and prioritization. Multimodal and multichannel service, including our internal service channels, and over time, the customer has chosen to interface.\nAnd the goal is, first, to have a better customer experience at every implementation and then to significantly lower operating costs with even higher tenured service employees because the quality of the job is enhanced, all a virtuous cycle to lower service transactions and cost and improve customer satisfaction, churn and customer growth. The prospect for Agentic AI tools for our back-office employees and software developers has also rapidly increased, and those will be separate work streams within the company.\nThe benefit is still probably 12 to 18 months away but we believe the impact can be real and material and we'll plan on updating progress on future calls. So the current operating environment is driving us every day to perform better than we are, whether it's continued improvement in our network and product capabilities, adapting our marketing strategy to find audience and drive traffic in a temporarily challenging macro and competitive environment, we're improving execution of our customer service commitments through all the efforts I mentioned.\nWe're becoming a better operator every day. Consumers are noticing as evidenced by our improving brand perception. All of that effort is in support of our core strategy of offering the best products, including seamless connectivity and seamless entertainment, the most value with unmatched service. And ultimately, those efforts in our differentiated network will drive perpetuity free cash flow growth, which remains our focus for shareholder value creation. Now I'll pass it over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's please turn to our customer results on Slide 11. Including residential and small business, we lost 109,000 Internet customers in the third quarter in line with last year's results, but lower when adjusted to remove last year's impact from ACP-related disconnects.\nIn mobile, we added 493,000 lines with higher gross additions year-over-year, offset by disconnects on a larger base. Video customers declined by 70,000 versus a loss of $294,000 in 3Q of '24 with the improvement primarily driven by better connects year-over-year, resulting from the new pricing and packaging we launched last fall and the various product improvements that Chris covered and lower churn year-over-year, driven in part by our programmer app inclusion packaging.\nWireline voice customers declined by $200,000. In rural, we continue to see accelerating customer relationship growth. We generated 52,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. And in the third quarter, we grew our subsidized rural passings by 124,000 and by over 453,000 over the last 12 months.\nWe continue to expect subsidized rural passings growth of approximately $450,000 in 2025, in addition to continued nonrural construction and fill-in activity. The bad bidding process is largely complete. We bid in 20 different states and were awarded subsidies associated with approximately 84,000 passings. In total, we expect to spend approximately $230 million of our own capital, net of subsidies to build out those passings over the next several years.\nMoving to third quarter revenue results on Slide 12. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 2.1%. And while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1% year-over-year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile lines.\nThose factors were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of low-priced video packages within our base and $106 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue versus $25 million in the prior year period. That allocation should grow over time as more customers authenticate into our streaming application offers that is neutral to EBITDA.\nAs Slide 12 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 1.1% and by 0.4% when excluding costs allocated to streaming apps and netted within video revenue in both periods. Turning to commercial revenue. Total commercial grew by 0.9% year-over-year with mid-market and large business revenue growth of 3.6%. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, mid-market and large business revenue grew by 4%.\nSmall business revenue declined by 0.9% and reflecting a decline in small business customers with revenue per customer remaining essentially flat year-over-year. Third quarter advertising revenue declined by 21%, including the impact of less political. Excluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 0.5% with national and local advertising market challenges, partly offset by our higher advanced advertising and better inventory selling capabilities.\nOther revenue grew by 10.7%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was down 0.9% year-over-year. and grew 0.4% when excluding advertising revenue and costs allocated to streaming apps and netted within video revenue in both periods.\nMoving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. In the third quarter, total operating expenses decreased by 0.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 6.5% due to a 3.5% decline in video customers year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, and $106 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nOther cost of revenue increased by 4.6% and primarily driven by higher mobile service direct costs and mobile device sales, partly offset by lower franchise and regulatory fees and lower advertising sales costs given lower political activity. Cost to service customers, which combines field and technology operations and customer operations decreased 0.7% year-over-year, primarily due to lower bad debt expense and labor costs partly offset by higher network utility costs.\nExcluding bad debt cost to service customers was essentially flat year-over-year. Marketing and residential sales expense grew by 5.4% due to some higher marketing spend with dramatically higher impressions at lower cost and continued channel mix shift from lower cost channels like in-house call centers to digital and affiliates.\nFinally, other expense increased by 0.7%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by 1.5% year-over-year in the quarter and was essentially flat when excluding advertising. We expect 2025 full year EBITDA growth to be flat or marginally positive year-over-year, with higher underlying growth absent the impact of political advertising. And EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter will be pressured by at least as much as it was in the third quarter, given last year's political advertising strength and the same macro pressures we saw in the third quarter.\nTurning to net income. We generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter compared to $1.3 billion last year. Given this quarter's lower adjusted EBITDA and higher other operating expenses driven by merger and acquisition costs related to the pending Cox transaction and severance costs.\nTurning to Slide 14. Capital expenditures totaled a bit less than $3.1 billion in the third quarter, nearly $500 million higher than last year's third quarter due to CPE spend timing and higher network evolution spend. We continue to expect total 2025 capital expenditures to reach approximately $11.5 billion, lower than our original outlook of $12 billion, primarily as the result of some network evolution capital pushed into 2026.\nDespite that push, our goal is to ensure that 2025 is the peak capital year even if by a small margin. And aside from the network evolution timing variance, our previous commentary on capital outlook on a stand-alone basis remains the same. Further, even including the impact of the Cox transaction and associated integration capital we expect total combined company capital expenditures to decline in the first full calendar year post close.\nAll of those statements are inclusive of the bead spending I mentioned earlier. Turning to free cash flow on Slide 15. Third quarter free cash flow totaled $1.6 billion, in line with prior year, given higher CapEx offset by lower cash taxes and a more favorable change in cable working capital tied to CPE spend, some of which will reverse in 4Q. And we expect full year change in cable working capital to be modestly positive.\nTurning to quarterly and full year 2025 cash taxes. Third quarter cash taxes totaled $53 million, and we expect full year cash tax payments to total approximately $1 billion. We finished the third quarter with $95 billion in debt principal. Our weighted average cost of debt remains at an attractive 5.2% and our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.9 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $2.2 billion at an average price of $292 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially to 4.15x and stood at 4.23x pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction.\nAs I've noted before, during the pendency of the Cox deal, we plan to be at or slightly under 4.25x leverage pro forma for the Liberty transaction. Post close, however, we will move our long-term target leverage to 3.5x to 4x, and we would expect to delever to the middle of that range within 2 to 3 years following close.\nBefore moving to Q&A, I wanted to remind everyone that as our capital spending peak this year and as we begin to benefit from President Trump's new tax legislation, we are poised for rapid free cash flow and free cash flow per share growth over the next several years.\nSlide 16 lays that phenomenon out very clearly. And with the additional upside potential from future EBITDA growth, a declining stand-alone share count and the powerful economic and strategic benefits of our Cox transaction. The pro forma entity will generate higher free cash flow per share in spite of delevering, which will reduce our cost of capital. And as Chris mentioned, sustainable free cash flow is our key focus metric for delivering shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.",

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements.\nAs a reminder, all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO.\nWith that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Stefan. During the Q2, we remained the fastest-growing mobile provider in the United States. We added 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines in the quarter and 2.1 million lines over the last 12 months for growth of nearly 25%, all because we offer seamless connectivity with the fastest speeds at the best price.\nIn the Q2, internet customer losses of 117,000 improved from 149,000 last year. Our video customer losses improved fivefold year-over-year to 80,000, driven by better connects and lower churn. Revenue was up slightly year-over-year, while second-quarter EBITDA grew by 0.5%, and we expect to grow EBITDA for the full year. The operating environment remains competitive. In Q2, we drove higher levels of sales year-over-year and lower voluntary churn, partly offset by higher levels of non-pay internet churn absent ACP.\nWe have not seen a material change in the competitive landscape, and we remain confident that we'll return to internet customer growth over time through our operating strategy of delivering the best networks and products at the best value for customers, combined with unmatched service.\nThe new pricing and packaging we launched last September continues to produce good results, including a higher number of total products sold at Connect, a gig attach rate that's nearly doubled, more mobile lines per customer connect, and a video sell-in rate that's improved substantially, with lower churn across both our traditional expanded basic packages and our skinny bundles.\nOur video product continues to improve. In June, we announced the inclusion of Hulu with our traditional packages. Hulu should become available for those customers prior to the launch of ESPN Unlimited. Together with Fox One, our inclusion offer will then be essentially complete.\nAs slide six shows, we will offer over $100 in monthly value inside of our seamless entertainment packages at no additional cost to customers. Our streaming app activation process for customers has improved, and we'll be ramping our marketing of seamless entertainment together with our programming partners.\nThis month, we began launching the sale of à la carte programmer streaming applications to customers without traditional video packages, including broadband-onlys. In the coming months, we'll also launch our video marketplace. It's a place where customers can discover, activate, migrate, upgrade, and downgrade their streaming inclusion apps.\nIt'll also be a starting place for video-centric sales leads and a place to learn about and buy Spectrum TV video packages like TV Select and Stream, and à la carte programmer streaming applications. So why have we worked so hard to improve an ecosystem that's been in structural decline for years?\nThe reason is because we've recreated the video product into something of much higher quality with unique video packaging, flexibility, and value. Together with Xumo, we solve a growing content discovery problem. Our video product can be yet another competitive advantage for our internet and mobile sales, and it drives churn lower. It's the convergence of our connectivity services and video through seamless entertainment.\nI do want to highlight that our programming deals over the past two years, including recent extensions and co-marketing efforts, reflect our programming partners' belief in our customer video proposition. Those relationships are probably in the best place I've seen. Turning to internet specifically, we offer gig-capable seamless connectivity, wireline, and wireless across 100% of our footprint. We're not standing still.\nOur wireline network evolution is effectively a very low-cost Spectrum acquisition across 58 million passings, adding up to 1 GHz of additional Spectrum when we move to 1.8 GHz. We're deploying symmetrical and multi-gig speeds everywhere we operate. In July, we completed the addition of 2x1 Gbps service to all of our step one markets, approximately 15% of our footprint.\nStep two, including DOCSIS 3.1 Distributed Access Architecture, is now underway to the next 50% of our footprint. We'll deliver 5x1 Gbps service there, as well as fiber-on-demand capabilities. Step three, adding DOCSIS 4.0 to the equation, will expand capacity even more, allowing us to offer 10x1 Gbps service. We're also in full deployment mode of our hybrid mobile network operator, or HMNO, network, deploying CBRS small cells across an additional 23 markets. In mobile, our rapid growth continues.\nFor the last five quarters, the majority of our line net adds have come from Unlimited Plus lines with higher value in RPU at a fraction of competitive prices, with faster speeds and better connectivity. We've also been selling more mobile lines per connect with our new packaging and upselling additional lines to existing mobile households.\nConvergence reduces churn, and higher mobile lines per customer benefits churn further. On convergence and higher line counts, earlier this week, we announced a long-term MVNO relationship with T-Mobile, which enhances our Spectrum Business package of connectivity services and can accelerate Spectrum Mobile growth over time.\nWe look forward to working with T-Mobile. From a financial perspective, mobile EBITDA, less mobile CapEx, is positive. For the last couple of quarters, that figure has been positive, even including the impact of customer device financing.\nOutside of our multi-line phone balance buyout, we don't see a need to subsidize acquisition, given our market-leading speed and value. So the mobile business is now becoming a real tailwind to our free cash flow growth, and it'll continue to increase.\nTurning to customer service, we have a unique opportunity to create a competitive advantage here. The significant investments to improve our customer service were largely made over the past few years, those being technology, including digitization, AI, network intelligence, and direct investments in our US-based employees.\nOur technology investments have been primarily directed at applications that directly benefit customers in various self-help channels and machine learning and AI-based frontline service tools to make servicing customers easier and more efficient for our employees.\nWe're currently focused on using machine learning and AI to take full advantage of all of our network and in-home telemetry to identify and address service issues before they ever occur. Our investments in employees themselves are focused primarily on driving employee tenure, which drives better craftsmanship and customer service.\nIt starts with good-paying US jobs and benefits, and then we expanded that with career paths, including self-progression, training and education, and enhanced retirement benefits. We recently extended that notion of better service from better craftsmanship and commitment to a unique frontline ownership program geared towards tenure, with the company matched based on tenure and a three-year investment holding period.\nIn the first election window of our employee stock purchase plan, nearly 15,000 largely frontline employees opted to directly invest and become owners of our company.\nOur employees understand the investments we're making, and they believe they own not just their career and retirement here. They increasingly act like owners of the business, and that's good for our customers, the communities we serve, and our shareholders.\nUltimately, our investments in employees and technology are all resulting in significant and sustainably improved service. Cable billing and repair calls were down 14% YoY in the second quarter, with a near 10% decrease in truck rolls despite significant weather impacts. We're seeing tangible improvements in how customers perceive our service, products, and pricing.\nWe also have a public customer commitment backed by service credits, including if we can't be at your home or business the same day. Internally, we're moving that standard to two-hour windows. Why? Because we can. We're now doing it a large percentage of the time.\nWe believe it'll take our competitors years of investment to catch up. Taking a step back, we still recognize the competitive environment we're in. Our operating and capital allocation strategy means we've been making the investments to put us in a position of confidence today. Network evolution to ensure the fastest wireline speeds.\nConvergence to make the same speed and reliability available seamlessly. Extending our network to rural footprint, which often becomes suburban density in the future. And transforming video to provide value and utility in a complex ecosystem, driving connectivity sales and retention.\nAnd then pairing those network and product investments with market-leading pricing and packaging to save customers money. All with a commitment-backed, best-in-class US-based service from employees who are tenured, committed, and act like owners because they are, all of which has yet to fully take hold.\nSo how do you know as an investor whether it works? Because everything we're doing is what you as a customer want. As customer demand for bandwidth, reliability, and low-latency service seamlessly connected continues to increase, I believe we're in the best competitive position. I think that's true with or without a step change from AI, VR, edge computer, other transformational shifts, which have always occurred when we have ubiquitously expanded the capabilities of our network for advanced products.\nA logical expansion of our strategy was our announcement in May to acquire Cox Communications. This combination offers significant benefits for customers, employees, local communities, and shareholders. The transaction will marry Spectrum's operating strategy with the B2B capabilities and community investment heritage of Cox, together with our shared philosophy of long-term investment in our network and employees.\nIt will bring Spectrum products and prices to the Cox footprint where we don't operate today, increasing competition in those markets to the benefit of consumers and increasing onshore labor to the benefit of employees. This transaction is good for America. It's also a great outcome for both our current shareholders and for the Cox family.\nThe transaction is priced at an attractive valuation, and it's accretive to top-line growth, margin, and to levered free cash flow per share, even when absorbing the impact of a modest de-levering of the combined business, and without factoring in the benefits of a lower cost of capital and the value of Cox as a sophisticated long-term shareholder. As we spend more time thinking through the integration, assuming regulatory approval, we continue to see areas of additional opportunity.\nIn the meantime, the employees of both companies are focused on business as usual and delivering value for our respective shareholders. Now I'll pass it over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Chris. Please recall that last quarter, we made a number of expense reclassifications to reflect changes in how we manage our business in connection with the recent launch of the Spectrum Business brand. Again, these reclassifications did not result in any changes to total operating expenses or Adjusted EBITDA for any period.\nPlease turn to our customer results on slide 9. Including residential and small business, we lost 117,000 internet customers in the still seasonal second quarter, compared to a loss of about 100,000 in last year's Q2 when adjusted to remove last year's impact of about 50,000 ACP-related disconnects.\nWhen comparing this year's Q2 internet net adds versus last year's Q2, we have not adjusted our second quarter 2024 internet net adds for the 50,000 ACP-related gross adds headwind we called out last year when comparing to 2023, as neither the second quarter of 2025 nor 2024 had the benefit of ACP-related gross additions.\nIn mobile, we added 500,000 lines with higher gross additions year-over-year, offset by a lower year-over-year churn rate on a larger line base. Video customers declined by 80,000 versus a loss of 408,000 in Q2 2024, our best video quarter since 2021, with the improvement primarily driven by better connects year-over-year resulting from the new pricing and packaging we launched last fall and lower churn year-over-year, driven in part by our programmer app inclusion packaging.\nWireline voice customers declined by 220,000. In rural, we activated our 1 millionth subsidized rural passing during the Q2.\nOur success in rural has benefited from both the scale and experience we bring to the complex process of network construction. During the quarter, we grew our subsidized rural passings by 123,000 and by over 440,000 over the last 12 months. We generated 47,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter.\nWe continue to expect rural passings growth of approximately 450,000 in 2025, in addition to continued non-rural construction and fill-in activity. Moving to Q2 revenue results on slide 10, over the last year, residential customers declined by 2.1%, while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.7% YoY, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile.\nThose factors were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, and $67 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue. This allocation should grow over time as more customers authenticate into our streaming application offers, but is neutral to EBITDA.\nAs slide 10 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.4%. Turning to commercial revenue, total commercial revenue grew by 0.8% YoY, with mid-market and large business revenue, formerly Spectrum Enterprise, growth of 2.9%. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, mid-market and large business revenue grew by 3.5%. Small business revenue declined by 0.6%, reflecting a decline in small business customers, with revenue per customer remaining essentially flat year-over-year. Q2 advertising revenue declined by 6.7%, including the impact of less political revenue.\nExcluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 4.4% due to a more challenged national and local advertising market, partly offset by our higher advanced advertising and better inventory selling capabilities. Other revenue grew by 18.9%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and a $45 million one-time benefit.\nIn total, consolidated Q2 revenue was up 0.6% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA on slide 11. In the Q2, total operating expenses increased by 0.6% YoY. Programming costs declined by 8.8% due to a 5.1% decline in video customers year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, and $67 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nOther costs of revenue increased by 7.3%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and mobile direct service costs.\nCost-to-service customers, which combines field and technology operations and customer operations, increased 3.8% YoY, primarily due to higher bad debt expense due to prior year cash basis accounting treatment for certain ACP customers and higher mobile device sales, higher network utility costs, labor-related costs primarily driven by recent storm activity, and banking card fees, partly offset by productivity from our tenure investments.\nExcluding bad debt, cost-to-service customers grew 2.4% YoY. Marketing and residential sales expense grew by 8.6% due to slightly higher sales volume as we make investments in marketing and sales, including in higher cost sales channels to drive growth. Finally, other expense increased by 0.6%. Before turning to Adjusted EBITDA, I wanted to note that there were a number of storms and tornadoes, particularly in the St. Louis area, Ohio, and the broader Midwest, that impacted our footprint in the Q2.\nWe extend our sympathies to those impacted. The combination of bill credits and storm cleanup expenses spread across our expense lines resulted in a $13 million headwind to EBITDA year-over-year. The CapEx impact was very small. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.5% YoY in the quarter. We expect to grow Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025. Year-to-date, we're on track with the H1 EBITDA growth of 2.6%.\nEBITDA growth will be pressured in Q3 and Q4, given last year's political advertising strength. Turning to net income, we generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in Q2, compared to $1.2 billion last year, given this quarter's higher Adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense.\nTurning to slide 12, capital expenditures totaled just under $2.9 billion in Q2, flat with last year's Q2, with higher network evolution and CPE spend offset by lower line extension spend. We now expect total 2025 capital expenditures to reach approximately $11.5 billion versus $12 billion previously, primarily due to the timing of network evolution spend and lower line extension spend spread in commercial and subsidized rural.\nThe majority of the $500 million spending shortfall this year will be spent next year in 2026. On a standalone basis, we still expect 2025 to be our peak capital spend year in dollar terms. 2025 should also be our peak year of capital intensity, even including the impact of the Cox transaction and associated integration capital, assuming that it's closed, with capital intensity falling going forward.\nAnd given the powerful economic and strategic benefits of our Cox transaction, the pro forma entity will generate higher free cash flow per share in spite of de-levering, which will reduce our cost of capital.\nTurning to free cash flow on slide 13, Q2 free cash flow totaled $1 billion, a decline of $250 million year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash taxes, higher cash interest, and a working capital headwind related to mobile handsets. Turning to Q2 and full year 2025 cash taxes, on our last call, I noted that we expected to pay approximately $1 billion in second quarter cash taxes. In the end, we ended up paying less than that, approximately $650 million, given the timing of certain tax-related items.\nLooking forward, new federal tax legislation passed by Congress and signed into law in July has improved our cash tax outlook for the full year.\nWe now expect that our calendar year 2025 cash tax payments will total a bit over $1 billion, down from a range of $1.6 to 2 billion previously, driven by our ability to depreciate more for tax purposes this year, given the permanent restoration of 100% bonus depreciation, our ability to now deduct more interest for tax purposes, given the permanent restoration of the EBITDA-based limitation, and our ability to now fully deduct research and experimentation expenditures for tax purposes.\nThe new tax legislation will ultimately save us several billion dollars in cash taxes over the next five years, helping to finance our capital expenditures and investments and supporting our free cash flow for at least the next five years while creating higher free cash flow per share, essentially permanently.\nWe appreciate the efforts of President Trump and Congress to restore these key business tax provisions, which will provide capital-intensive companies like ours the visibility to continue pursuing our long-term investments, including the significant investments we will make in the Cox network, driving benefits for customers and employees, and improving our competitiveness. We finished Q2 with $94.3 billion in debt principal. Our weighted average cost of debt remains at an attractive 5.2%, and our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.9 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $1.7 billion at an average price of $375 per share. As of the end of the Q2, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially to 4.1x and stood at 4.18x pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction.\nAs I mentioned on our Cox transaction investor call on May 16, during the pendency of the Cox deal, we plan to be at or slightly under 4.25x leverage pro forma for the Liberty transaction. Post-close, however, we will move to our long-term target leverage to 3.5x to 4.0x. We would expect to de-lever to the middle of that range within two to three years following close. I'll leave you with a few things.\nOur share of converged connectivity revenue within our footprint is still low, less than 30%. With better products and pricing, we have a long runway for organic customer, top line, EBITDA, and free cash flow growth for many years to come. We've made and are making the investments required to accelerate the growth of the business going forward, including network evolution, new pricing and packaging, innovations in seamless connectivity and entertainment, mobile service investments in AI, and employee tenure.\nOur free cash flow is about to surge. We are now in the midst of our peak capital intensity period, and moving beyond that peak on its own sets us up for rapid free cash flow and free cash flow per share growth over the next several years as capital intensity declines meaningfully.\nAnd finally, we plan to add all of that, our combination with Cox, which provides meaningful share price and free cash flow accretion to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the raise hand button, which can be found on the black bar at the bottom of your screen. When it is your turn, you will receive a message on your screen from the host asking you to talk, and then you will hear your name called. Please accept, unmute your audio, and ask your question.\nAs a reminder, we are allowing analysts one question today. We will wait one moment to allow the queue to form. Our first question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, thank you.\nI'm going to let others focus on the obligatory broadband questions and ask you about the T-Mobile deal that you announced for business and then the new MVNO. Can you just talk about that deal a little bit? I guess it's reasonable from our side to presume that part of the appeal was lower prices relative to the existing Verizon deal. But can we read anything into your targeting small businesses with T-Mobile about a potentially larger relationship? And what should we conclude that the deal means for the relationship with Verizon?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. I'll give the upfront caveat. Clearly, we have a good legal agreement with both of those parties, with T-Mobile and Verizon. And Verizon has been a great partner to us, and I think we've been the same. So we're going to continue to do that.\nWe've just entered into, I think, a very strategic relationship with T-Mobile, and so we intend to be good partners with them as well. We're really excited about the deal that we announced with T-Mobile, and we're looking forward to getting to market in the small, medium, and for us, large business space with the ability to enter into a market selling many more lines than we've been able to sell.\nThe ability to combine those mobile products together with already our market and price-leading wireline services that we have in small, medium, and large businesses, I think, has attracted the same way it is for residential. And we've been somewhat limited in terms of our ability to go to market in the business space. And so this opens the door for us to go do that.\nI'm not going to comment on pricing for the reasons I said at the outset, other than to say we're happy with the partnership that we have, both with T-Mobile now in the business segment as well as with Verizon. But I also think it's always good to have strategic relationships, but to have multiple strategic relationships.\nAnd we feel that this is helpful to the future of the business overall. In terms of impact to Verizon, it's not a space that we were heavily driving today. If you take a look at our really small business segment, where you can see our mobile lines that we publish, there is some business that exists there with Verizon. It's been relatively limited for the reasons that I just mentioned. That business on the increment will be moving towards T-Mobile and hopefully expanding at a more rapid rate.\nThe residential business that we have with Verizon is there, and it's a great relationship. It's worked, obviously, very, very well. I think it's strategic for them. It's strategic for us. They've said as much. And we look forward to being a great partner to both of those companies.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nAnd if I can just ask one quick follow-up question on that topic, I assume it's reasonable to assume that that deal contemplates the addition of Cox under the same relationship?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nI'm not going to get into the agreement, but we signed it after the announcement of Cox. So you should assume that we were thinking about a lot of things for the future.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nYep. Thanks, Craig. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Two quick ones, if I can.\nFirst for Jessica, thanks for the numbers on the tax reform. Do you have a number for 2026 and maybe more detail on the sort of the use of the cash tax savings? And then, as Craig suggested, switching to broadband. Chris, you gave some sort of high-level sort of detail on sort of gross adds, non-pay churn, and voluntary churn. And it seems like the non-pay churn might have been one of the drivers of the sort of core add declines.\nIs there any way you could give a little bit more color on that? It sounds like you're having some success getting new customers in, but that non-pay churn, maybe stemming from ACP, stepped up a bit. So any color on sort of that dynamic would be great. Thanks.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So I'll start on the tax question.\nAs I said in the change to the guidance this year, we did come down pretty dramatically in our expectations for 2025 cash taxes. We expect several billion dollars in the next five years. And if you look at what piece of that is in 2026, I think it's reasonable to assume that there's savings that's similar to or slightly larger than what we saw in this year. I mean, I think the big story is around sort of what it does to overall free cash flow. And in our modeling, the new rules can drive $10 or so of free cash flow per year for each of the next six years. So I think the impact is pretty dramatic.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\n$10 free cash flow per share.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. Sorry. Yeah. I said free cash flow. I didn't say per share. Sorry. There you go.\nIn terms of how we deploy the savings, our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We have and will continue to prioritize investments in organic investments in the business that generate positive ROI. As a result of the permanent bonus depreciation and interest deductibility rules, I would expect more projects to meet that positive ROI hurdle.\nThat being said, we're not updating our multi-year outlook except for the sort of timing items that I discussed in my remarks. We already invest a significant amount in our network. We plan to invest in our network in rural builds. In our proxy disclosures, we did the same for Cox, assuming that the transaction closes. Ultimately, our expectations around making those investments included expectations we would continue to get favorable rules. We're happy to see that that has played out, that that's played out well.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nJust to tack on that, we had, going into the Cox transaction, a good sense, and maybe it was HOG, maybe it was a well-placed bet, that the tax rules would be extended in a way that was helpful to infrastructure investors.\nThat enabled us to be as committed as we are to making the investments in the Cox network that you've seen when we published the proxy statement. So it was factored in there. There will be an uptick in investment that's directly tied to that, and it's reflected really in the Cox transaction. John, on the non-pay commentary, when you're in an environment where you're on the cusp of slight losses or slight ads, small movements in any category, whether it's sales, voluntary churn, or non-pay, can have an outsized impact on net ads.\nSo the non-pay, just taking a step back, is still at relatively low historic levels. However, it's stepped up year over year. And the reason that non-pay has stepped up year over year is because twofold. One is you have former ACP customers who are economically challenged and have a higher non-pay rate systemically without the benefit of the subsidy from a year-over-year standpoint. But in addition to that, from a year-over-year standpoint, you have newly acquired customers who would have qualified for the ACP, who don't have ACP today.\nAnd therefore, those newly acquired customers have a higher non-pay rate than they would otherwise. But just take a step back to be clear. Non-pay is up year over year. It's not dramatic, and it's not at a level that exceeds where we were certainly pre-pandemic.\nBut it's enough that on the cusp of net gain versus net loss that it has some impact that's offsetting the benefit that we have from higher sales and lower voluntary churn.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you both.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nYep. Thanks, John. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Maybe switching to video for a second. You had obviously a really fantastic video improvement. Still losing subs, but very modest. How do you see the offer evolving in terms of whether it's personalized recommendations or something else? Where do you see the most potential to improve the video experience? And can you just discuss the attach rate with broadband? Because there should be a ripple, you'd think there would be a ripple effect.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYes. There's a ton in what you just asked.\nI think the video strategy that we're deploying is designed to do a few things.\nOne is to meet customers wherever they want to go and wherever the market wants to go with the video product. So when you think about the packages that we offer, clearly the most beneficial to us and to programmers, and we think to consumers, is to have the full-fledged expanded video product because it has the most content in there, the best value, and include with that now over $100 worth of programmer apps, including Max, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, Paramount+, ViX, leaving out everybody else, ESPN.\nBut the whole thing, take a look at that slide. All that value is included. That's going to be the stickiest product. It's going to be the best for customers and for programmers, us, and it's going to be the best for our broadband churn as well.\nHaving said that, in moments of time where a customer can't afford that full package, we have some skinnier bundles that allow for generalized general entertainment packages, which we can then add on the programmer apps from time to time, sell through the programmer apps directly at retail through our video store to those consumers.\nAnd then finally, to the extent you have broadband customers who are looking to purchase à la carte programming apps, which they do today, and do it in a single place, that we'll have the ability to provide that utility and that value to customers. So wherever the market goes, wherever the product goes, we're in a position to provide that package and utility to the customers, really for the benefit of consumers, but also to the benefit of programmers as well.\nObviously, for us, having a high-quality video product that matches the customer's need enhances the value of our connectivity relationship being internet and mobile. If you then add Xumo into the equation, so the first piece that I just talked about was solving the value equation for customers.\nAnd the second piece is solving utility with Xumo. Xumo has the ability to integrate live TV together with all of these apps, which are included in increasingly more simplified authentication for customers to have in a single spot. So you have unified search and discovery across live, SVOD, as well as programmer apps in a way that's pretty unique in the marketplace.\nAnd with a voice remote that works, I think, better than any other voice remote that's out in the marketplace. Credit to Comcast, who is our partner in Xumo, 50/50 partner with Xumo, who really developed that technology.\nI think Xumo is a powerful tool to solve that utility and even more so when you combine it with the value. You asked about the attach rate. When we started to include in our new pricing and packaging in September a more focused effort in including video in the package together with mobile as a way to lower your internet pricing, today at $30 for 500 Mbps, $40 for a gig internet when you bundle with either video or internet, the uptake in video attach rate was significant. It's because we focused on it.\nIn fact, at the time, it really wasn't because of what we had done with the product. In fact, we haven't really started to put the full marketing engine between what we call seamless entertainment, the combination of your live video service plus all these apps.\nThe digital store, the video store isn't even launched yet. And we don't yet have the full backing, which we will, of our programming partners and all of their marketing capabilities behind. So I think the video space for us can continue to improve and improve significantly. And what I said in my prepared remarks was meant to make sure people don't think that we're thinking about this the wrong way.\nOur driver for having a high-quality video product is to be able to sell and retain more internet and mobile relationships. And that's the big driver for us. And we said two years ago that we wanted to get an environment either where we were going to not have video and focus on broadband or have video and have it as a competitive tool and asset towards our broadband and mobile relationships.\nAnd it's taking some time, but it's going well. And I think it's going to continue to get better for the benefit of not just video, but for the benefit of broadband and mobile relationships.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nYep. Thanks, Jessica. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Good morning. A question on taxes. You mentioned in your prepared remarks the $10 share benefit per year that might add up to, quote, several billion over five years. But just multiplying 10 by your share count and then five years, I get maybe twice as much as what I think several billion indicates. So I wondered if you could bridge that for us.\nAnd if you have any time to talk about your top-of-funnel customer acquisition results, how you feel about the results right now, and what you might need to see to change the strategy. Thank you.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nSo Peter, I think that the amount of additional free cash flow that I stated is appropriate. What matters is what you believe about share count over that period of time and how share count might change. You want to talk about funnel?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So if I'm going to talk about funnel, I really need to go talk about the overall market color, kind of reframe or restate a little bit of what I said in the prepared remarks. When you think about the top of the funnel, mobile, actually very good. Video, as I just talked about, significant improvement.\nSo everything I'm about to say really focuses on market color and funnel as it relates to internet. Just so that we set the stage, the volume, as I talked about, sales are actually up percentage-wise year over year and in units. Voluntary churn is down. Non-pay, as I just talked about, is up a little bit due to the lack of ACP.\nThe competitive environment is stable, not improving, but not deteriorating. So we have steady fiber overlap. That's not new. Cell phone internet continues at its pace for now. But just as big, when you think about the overall market and funnel, is the overall market is challenged because there's an incredibly low amount of moves and new builds, which is going very slow. And then in addition to that, you have a reversion to mobile-only customers. And ACP accelerated that.\nThat was taking place, reverting mobile-only back to the pre-pandemic level. You put all of those market movements, or in this case, lack of market movement, together with a new competitor, even if it's inferior, and it puts pressure, and it's not ideal. We're not sitting still. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we have network evolution.\nWe have the convergence features that we've been launching. And we're increasingly using mobile and video as a competitive advantage to drive internet sales and churn. And we also have an expanding rural footprint, which isn't just about today. A lot of what we're building today will turn into suburban footprint over a 5 to 10 year period. And so I think we're putting in, investing in significant lines of growth, all of which, in fairness, is long-term.\nSo if you think about the short-term and the top of the funnel for internet specifically, we don't have a product or pricing issue. We have the fastest speeds. We have the most reliable product, best Wi-Fi. We're selling, particularly in bundle, $30 500 Mbps internet, $40 gig. So it's not a product or pricing issue at the top of the funnel. It's the broader market that I talked about, some brand new competition.\nBut in fairness, we're working through our marketing message and how to do a better job of breaking through with our marketing message, given that there's an evolving mix in the marketplace in terms of channels and message. And we're changing some of the ways that we go to market, including some partners that we've used.\nAnd the second piece, I think, is an industry overall for the cable industry, and we're at the heart of that, is the value pitch that we're making to customers. And going back to customers very clearly, both in marketing, at the time of sale, and at the time of retention, and saying the only reason that you can have a cell phone internet product at that price is because they're forcing you to pay $60, $70 per mobile line.\nAnd when you think about what is on your bill with T-Mobile or Verizon 5G home internet, the reality is it's dramatically more expensive than what you would pay to Spectrum for an internet and mobile product. I just said that in 30 seconds, but how do you convert that into an advertising message? And how do you convert that into a sales pitch?\nI've said it before, and I say it internally as well. I think those are areas that we need to continue to do a better job. The good news is if you step back, what I said holds true. We have the best network. We have the best product. We have the best pricing. We're doing things long-term to even expand that competitive advantage.\nBut clearly, there's a sense of urgency that exists inside the company. And we're driving. And as an investor, I said it in the prepared remarks, but I really would say it again is I ask everyone to sit back and say, \"Okay, as a customer, what do you want?\" And what you want is all the things I've been describing. And so I think we're in great position. It's just we're doing things to move things both in the short-term and the long-term.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Peter.\nLeila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. Just quickly on EBITDA. So you reiterated expectations to grow EBITDA within 2025. Quick just housekeeping question. So Jessica, the $45 million one-timer on other revenue, what's the flow through to the bottom line there? I'm just trying to see if EBITDA would have grown in the Q2, excluding that.\nAnd then in the past, you've talked about cost to serve benefits, having legs, and that's one of the material drivers, that plus mobile for the EBITDA growth through the year. Any change there versus prior expectations? Should we still think about those as the drivers?\nAnd then if you could update us on cost expectations relative to last quarter, just given cost to serve and sales and marketing were a little bit higher than anticipated. Thank you.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So Sebastiano, the $45 million does fall all the way to the bottom line. There was a little bit of bad debt expense against it, I think around $7 million. So maybe it's like $38 million that falls all the way down.\nWe did point out there was this sort of unusual storm activity as well. I think when you factor those couple of things in, you end up pretty close to flat. From a cost to serve, and I guess if I just sort of go through the outlook for expense line items, it really hasn't changed. So cost to serve had a difficult comp inside of last year.\nIf you look across the quarters last year, this is really the only quarter that suffers from that issue. So I think still flat to slightly down in the year-over-year. Marketing and resi sales, there I also would say still a low to mid-single digit growth for the full year.\nWe should have a much slower year-over-year growth rate in the back half of the year versus the front half. A good portion of that is that the comps are a bit easier in the back half of the year. And we also expect overall sales and marketing expense to subside slightly as we move later in the year because of the mix of our activities. And we think it will do that without impacting sort of overall marketing levels or effectiveness.\nAnd then in other, there I would say also still in the low to mid-single digits, though, as I've noted before, other because of what's inside of it can be a bit more volatile than some of the other expense items.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThe one thing I just stepped back on cost to serve when you think longer term, not just in the coming quarter, long-term cost to serve is a huge opportunity and remains the case because the amount of transactions, as I mentioned, is coming down double digits every year. And I think that can accelerate with the benefit of the AI tools that we're putting in front of our agents. It's making the job easier. It's making the handle time go down. It's making repeats go down, which means you've got lower overall transactions.\nYou need less labor to handle the transactions because of the lower handle time and the lower number of transactions. And all of that's set to not only continue, but to compound. So I feel really good about the long-term trajectory of cost to serve, both in the standalone Charter as well as, assuming regulatory approval, the combination with Cox.\nSo it remains one of the biggest opportunities in front of the company. And it's why we spend so much time talking about the investments that we've made, not just in AI and machine learning, but also the quality of craftsmanship that exists with our employees because that's the key to getting to that holy grail. And the eventual impact, obviously, in the end, isn't really just about cost.\nIt's really about having better retention and having a better net promoter score and customer satisfaction in the marketplace, which drives sales as well. So it all comes together as a virtuous circle that you can have better revenue and lower cost as a result of making the right investments today. And that's what we've been doing for years.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Sebastiano. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the video topic. I was wondering if what you're seeing underlying the improvement is fewer bundled subs dropping video, or more new customers taking it, or more existing customers adding it. Is there any color you could provide on what specifically is driving the improvement in subscriber trends?\nAnd then just related to that, are you starting to see any favorable change in that mix shift toward the lower end and toward the full video packages as a result of the new product construct that you've launched? Thanks.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYep. I think the answer to your first question is yes. We're seeing higher sales. We're seeing lower churn and better upgrades. So video sales at new internet acquisition as well as video upgrades to existing internet. And so it's all of the above. And it's going well. And I expect that to continue to improve here.\nIn terms of shift, we're at the point where not only are we going to start marketing the benefits of seamless entertainment more broadly together with the pending launch of our video store, but as part of that has the ability to increasingly upgrade customers who are inside of the skinnier bundles into a more fulsome package. You can think about different ways to do that, of course: traditional email, text, or even direct mail.\nBut in addition to that, if you take a look on our guide today, what you'll notice in the Spectrum TV app guide and their guides generally is an ability to upgrade into different packages by using TiVo and Guide and using the programmer apps as an insertion of the TiVo and the Guide to drive that.\nNow, that can be for existing full expanded basic customers who haven't activated yet and have the ability to activate and will use that for activation activity, but also for customers who are in a skinny package and have the ability to upgrade. A good example of that would be the inclusion of Peacock now that they're going to have 50 exclusive games and having the Peacock title and guide inside of there.\nSomebody goes and takes a look at the traditional channels that have historically covered the NBA and have a Peacock title and guide that allows them to either activate their Peacock subscription, which is included for expanded video, or to upgrade into the full expanded package from a skinny package. So that's just one tiny example.\nYou can think about how we've used Max for sure already, Disney+ already in those genre areas, as well as Hulu. I'm giving one example by using Title and Guide. When you think about the video store and what it can do and what we can do in MySpectrum app and .NET and .COM platforms that we have, I think we can start to get the customer to where they're going to find the most value according to what they can afford.\nAnd again, none of that's because we're outright just trying to save video. It's really because we're trying to drive better broadband and mobile performance. And we think it's a competitive advantage that we have if we do it right.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\nThanks, Bryan. Leila, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Our next question will come from Steven Cahill with Wells Fargo.\n\nSteven Cahill\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\nSo Chris, you all have a lot of experience buying and integrating, including on the customer-facing side, with your historical acquisitions. I think with Cox, the internet ARPU is above Charter's. So can you just think about how you're thinking about managing that transition when it comes? I imagine you're going to see a lot of customer touchpoints. It's probably an opportunity to sell in more services.\nSo maybe you can just help us think through that. And then as it relates to the CapEx outlook and capital intensity, kind of related questions. So it sounds like that's going to be going down even pro forma for the acquisition. I imagine that's a lot of technology savings. So maybe you can just give a bit more color on where you see a lot of those savings for that intensity coming from. Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure.\nFrom an integration perspective on customer pricing and packaging, you're right. We have a lot of experience doing that. When you think about Bresnan, Time Warner Cable, Bright House, and even the original Charter in 2013, all of those integrations had higher starting ARPU for broadband. And we needed to find a way to migrate those customers into a package that was more competitive without doing financial damage to the company.\nAnd the way to do that is to provide more value to customers. You can do that simply with more speed or more value in the internet product itself. But you can also do that with packaging and bundling for new customers so that when you're selling, you have a higher ARPU per relationship than you would have otherwise, even though you have a lower internet pricing.\nFor existing customers, it's usually the second stage where you start to offer them proactively only to the extent that they want it, the ability to have better pricing on a single product when they add additional products in. The way that we've done that historically really was through just video and wireline phone.\nToday, I think we have an even more powerful tool to do that when you think about mobile. If you reflect on everything that we've been talking about on this call around the video product and what we can do with that and the mobile product and saving a customer hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year when they add just a couple of mobile lines, our ability to migrate customers at their discretion and to have new customer acquisition with lower product pricing but higher overall customer relationship ARPU is fairly proven.\nCox, in particular, if you think about it, their video penetration is about half of what ours is today. And their mobile penetration today, because they started later, is coming from almost nowhere by definition.\nAnd so we have all the tools available, I think, to do that. And you combine that with these networks have been very well invested. It's had very good service. So it's actually a better position we're coming from in Cox relative to what we had in Time Warner Cable, for example, probably more akin to Brighthouse, frankly, where we had a lot of success growing that very quickly as a result of putting better product pricing and packaging on the back of a very well-invested network with great employees and from a service perspective.\nThe CapEx trajectory, the type of network activity that we do, given our scale, I believe can occur at a lower cost per passing. And probably more important to that is the technology platforms that we're deploying.\nYou deploy it once instead of twice when you combine together, all of which means that you have the ability to reduce the amount of capital expenditure on some of the fixed platforms and reinvest the transaction synergies from a CapEx perspective back into additional network capabilities through the eventual high-split upgrade that would take place on Cox later down the road. They're all fairly traditional.\nAnd clearly, there's procurement synergies there too, given our scale and procurement synergies that don't just apply to the Cox assets, but is getting marginally bigger for Charter, not huge, but marginally bigger for Charter.\nNot factored probably into that is could we do even better as the combined company? We'll see, but that's not an explicit goal.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. And I think the thing to sort of layer on top of that is you do have the natural benefit. I mean, Charter's standalone capital intensity, we had an expectation that it was going to decline dramatically over the next four years already. And that standalone expectation isn't diminished in any way by taking on the Cox assets. When you take on the Cox assets, you have more revenue. But actually, we have space to do what we need to from a transition capital perspective inside of still having a really nice decline in capital intensity over time.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nIt's probably a good opportunity to highlight. I know there's been some questions or speculations.\nThe Charter CapEx outlook, other than some timing between years that could push from one year to the other, investors can depend on what we've provided for the Charter CapEx. We don't typically do that. The fact that we did meant we understood the importance, and you can take that one literally to the bank.\nThey should also feel very comfortable with the outlook that was in the proxy statement for combined CapEx of the combined company. I feel pretty comfortable with the envelope that exists inside there as well. And so the Free Cash Flow generation that Jessica has spoken about at this point, we feel like it's pretty much math. And atypical for us, we wanted to make sure that it was provided out there and that people could depend on it.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Steven. Leila, we'll take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, in light of some of the increased fiber investments you've seen from some of your competitors in the market, whether you're thinking any differently about your multi-year CapEx outlook, either in terms of the overall envelope or in terms of the composition, and specifically maybe talk to the prospects for increased rural build investments, and maybe using that as a source for the cash tax savings. Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThe answer to your question, the first one is no. Through our network upgrade, we have the ability to do fiber on demand to the extent that a customer needed 25 Gb of symmetrical speeds, which is pretty far out there at this point. So we have that capability with fiber on demand.\nSo there's no need to update in any way or change the CapEx outlook, as I just mentioned. For increased rural investment, there'll be some BEAD that comes in as an overlay. And we're looking through that currently.\nWe expect to participate. But because of how much rural we've already built today, the opportunities at the edge of our network, it's a lot lower than it once was, primarily because of what we ourselves have done, but as well as others through RDOF and ARPA. So the size of the opportunity of tangential network build is lower than it was just a couple of years ago.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks very much, everybody. That concludes our call.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results.\nAny forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. As a reminder, all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks Stefan. We performed well during Q1, adding over 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and over 2.1 million lines over the last year for line growth of over 25%. We continue to be the fastest growing mobile provider in the US with the fastest connectivity at the best price. Our internet customer results improved year-over-year as we continue to compete well. With the Affordable Connectivity Program headwind now behind us. Revenue was relatively flat year-over-year while EBITDA growth accelerated to 4.8% driven.\nBy a strong contribution from mobile growth and continually improving service quality through employee and technology investments, which also reduced service transactions and cost. The operating environment remains competitive, but the impact of the elimination of the ACP is behind us. On the fiber front we continue to do well. While our fiber overlap is expanding, it's growing at about the same pace we've seen for the past couple years. We also believe these new fiber builds are destined for poor financial returns.\nCell phone internet growth appears to have plateaued, and broadband data usage continues to grow. In Q1, monthly data usage by our non-video internet customers grew to approximately 825 GB per month and over 30% of those customers now use over 1 TB of data per month. With handset data usage growing at an even faster rate, our fully converged network is the most efficient way to satisfy that growing demand for data. Unlike cell phone networks which need to regularly execute massive network upgrades via densification Which gets reported as CapEx or if they choose not to densify, tens of billions of dollars in Spectrum acquisitions that aren't included in investor or analyst models.\nUnlicensed Spectrum via Wi-Fi continues to be the wireless workhorse for the American consumer, and for the mobile telcos, Spectrum Mobile devices utilize our gigabit-enabled fully managed network for the vast majority of traffic, and they offload less than 13% of traffic to slower 5G macro cell towers. Our CBRS deployment is going very well, and by the end of this year will be launched across 23 markets using low power, shared, licensed, and unlicensed Spectrum fully deployed across high traffic areas with good ROIs.\nIn the meantime, we continue to execute on our long held strategy of delivering the best networks and products at the best value for residential and business customers combined with unmatched service. So we have a unique set of assets and significant scale as shown on slide 4. We offer the fastest internet, the best Wi-Fi, the fastest mobile product, and Spectrum is the leading video provider in the US The power of our network continues to improve with symmetrical and multi-gig speeds everywhere we operate. We are adding 2x1 Gb per second service to recently upgraded markets.\nThis year and the next phases of our network evolution will deliver 5 gig, 10 Gb per second service. As a reminder, the high split in DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade effectively creates up to 1GHz of Spectrum acquisition across our 950,000mi footprint. That network Spectrum expansion enables up to 10 Gb per second of speed to each premises and can also power small cells for unlicensed and shared licensed Spectrum nearly everywhere. Our footprint continues to grow with our expansion initiative setting us up for future customer growth as portions of today's rural build become tomorrow's suburban footprint.\nUnlike our competitors, we provide the very best of our products across 100% of our footprint with full marketing and service capabilities, as shown on slide 5. Having the best network and product capabilities by itself isn't enough, though we have to offer the most value. Slide 6 of today's presentation shows just one example of the value we offer versus our competitors. We give customers easy ways to sav hundreds and even thousands of dollars per year, whether at promotion or retail with the best products. The last key component is service.\nWe've always believed that investing in customer service and satisfaction creates a virtuous cycle in our business that leads to customer and financial growth and value creation. Our sales and service are 100% US-based using our own employees with good paying jobs and benefits. We're focused on ensuring that Charter is a great place to build a long rewarding career, building tenure and driving better employee performance. All part of our execution initiative that we launched a few years ago.\nNext week we'll announce to employees our New Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The program gives eligible employees the option to purchase Charter stock with matching restricted stock units, which increases based on tenure. Our employees are US-based and committed to their careers, and the local communities we all serve, as customers themselves and now as owners. We've also been investing in machine learning and AI for a number of years.\nThese applications directly benefit customers in various self-help channels of course, but most of our effort is on making frontline work easier and more efficient. Ultimately, our investments in employee compensation, tenure, facilities and tools including machine learning and AI are all resulting in significant improved service. Cable billing and repair calls were down 15% year-over-year in the Q1 and service truck rolls were down 6%. That's been the trend and it continues.\nLooking forward, AI remains a very large opportunity for us to create value for customers and shareholders. While we could sit back knowing our product quality and value proposition are better, and our long-term investments are working, we're not standing still. In September of last year we launched our Life Unlimited brand refresh. Also our new customer commitment which commits us to reliability and same-day service with customer credits when we do miss the mark.\nIn our new pricing and packaging, which better utilizes our market-leading mobile and now video products to present lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to grow customer ARPU despite lower product pricing. That pricing and packaging is driving a higher number of total products sold at connect including video with the launch of Seamless Entertainment still to come. And our Gig internet attach rate is now close to double what it was a year ago.\nAs a reminder, our internet and mobile products have no contracts, price locks when bundled, market-leading service commitments with 100% US-based service and sales, and taxes and fees, are included in our pricing. None of our connectivity competitors do that. Taken together, that's our strategy offering the best products including seamless connectivity and seamless entertainment, the most value with unmatched service driving higher quality revenue for home passings with free cash flow growth, and high return on investment.\nBefore I turn things over to Jessica, I wanted to note that this week we added two Liberty nominated members to our Board of Directors, Marty Patterson and David Wargo. I'd like to welcome them both to our board and, at the same time, Greg Maffei and Jim Meyer, two Liberty Broadband designees, rolled off this week as well, and I'd like to thank them for their many years of service and value creation for Charter and for our shareholders. Now I'll pass it over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks Chris. Please note that today's results include several Los Angeles wildfire effects. As Chris mentioned last quarter, we are committed to these communities and to actively rebuilding them. Our Q1 results include approximately 9,000 disconnects related to the fires. We provided credits to impacted customers and also incurred some incremental expenses, but Q1 adjusted EBITDA was not meaningfully impacted by either. We expect that as we rebuild our plant to approximately 16,000 homes passed in Los Angeles over the coming quarters, we will incur additional CapEx, though not at a level that would require us to change our outlook.\nAlso, please note that this quarter we made a number of expense reclassifications to reflect changes in how we manage our business in connection with the recent launch of our Spectrum Business brand. The reclassifications do not result in any changes to operating expenses or adjusted EBITDA for any period. We've reclassified prior periods so that appropriate year-over-year growth calculations can be accurately derived, and today's published trending schedule also shows our P&L using both the new and previous expense disclosure methodologies. So that you can see the impact of the changes.\nLet's please turn to our customer results on Slide 10. Including residential and SMB, we lost 60,000 internet customers in Q1. In mobile, we added 514,000 lines. Video customers declined by 181,000 versus a loss of 405,000 in Q1 2024, with the improvement primarily driven by the rebundling we launched in September along with our Life Unlimited brand refresh. Video performance doesn't yet reflect the benefits of incorporating seamless entertainment apps in our product.\nWireline voice customers declined by 278,000. We were generally pleased with our Q1 customer results. During the quarter we saw improvements in customer gross additions across internet, video, and mobile and lower churn in video and mobile with internet churn stable year-over-year despite the lack of ACP and well below pre-COVID levels. We continue to compete well across our footprint.\nIn rural we ended the quarter with 902,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 89,000 in the Q1 and by over 400,000 over the last 12 months, and we generated 39,000 customer net additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We continue to expect rural passings growth of approximately 450,000 in 2025, our biggest year so far in addition to continued non-rural construction and fill-in activity.\nMoving to Q1 revenue on slide 11. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 2.1% while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.1% year-over-year given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile. Those factors were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base and $47 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue. As Slide 11 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.1%.\nTurning to commercial revenue, total commercial grew by 1.4% year-over-year with mid-market and large business revenue formerly, Spectrum Enterprise growth of 3.9% driven by PSU growth of 5.4%. When excluding all wholesale revenue, mid-market, and large business revenue grew by 4.4%. Small business revenue declined by 0.2%, reflecting a decline in small business customers partly offset by higher revenue per customer. Q1 advertising revenue declined by 12.9% primarily due to less political revenue. Excluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 5.1% due to a more challenged national and local advertising market.\nOther revenue grew by 13.4%, primarily driven by higher mobile devices, and in total, consolidated Q1 revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year and 0.8% when excluding advertising revenue. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 12 in the Q1. Total operating expenses declined by 2.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 10.4% due to a 7.3% decline in video customers year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, and $47 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nQ1 2025 programming costs included $12 millions of favorable adjustments versus $28 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year period. Other cost of revenue increased by 8.7% primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher mobile and mobile service direct costs. Cost to service customers, which combines field and technology operations, and customer operations, declined 2.2% year-over-year, primarily due to productivity from our 10-year investment including lower labor costs.\nMarketing and residential sales expense grew by 7.7% as we remain focused on driving customer acquisition and given our Life Unlimited brand relaunch in September. Finally, other expense declined by 7.8%, mostly driven by one-time benefits of $75 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 4.8% year-over-year in the quarter and by 3.4% when excluding the one-time benefits in other expense that I mentioned.\nTurning to net income, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the Q1 compared to $1.1 billion last year. Given this quarter's higher adjusted EBITDA and lower interest expense partly offset by a non-cash impairment driven by a balance sheet write-down of our LA Lakers RSN this quarter. Turning to Slide 13, capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in Q1, down about $400 million from last year's Q1, driven by the timing of CPE spend upgrade rebuild related to network evolution and line extension spend.\nWhile we continue to assess the potential impact of new tariffs, we don't currently expect tariffs to have a significant impact on our capital expenditures for this year and over the next several years. We have attractive agreements with our equipment vendors and we continue to work with them to minimize the impact of tariffs while at the same time supporting the health of the cable equipment ecosystem. We continue to expect total 2025 capital expenditures to reach approximately $12 billion, and we have not changed our multi-year capital outlook.\nWe also don't anticipate the tariffs to have a meaningful impact on our P&L as the vast majority of our P&L expenses are programming, labor, and service-driven and are not subject to the new tariffs. Turning to Free Cash Flow on Slide 14, Q1 free cash totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion compared to last year's Q1. The increase was primarily driven by lower capital expenditures, higher EBITDA, and lower cash interest.\nJust a brief comment on 2025 cash taxes. We still expect, under existing tax legislation, that our calendar year 2025 cash tax payments will total between $1.6 billion and 2 billion. However, we expect Q2 cash taxes to total around $1 billion given the two cash tax payments we are always required to make in Q2 and some other timing items. We finished the quarter with $93.6 billion in debt principal. Our weighted average cost of debt remains at an attractive 5.2%. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.9 billion.\nWe began repurchasing stock in late February following shareholder approval of the Liberty Broadband transaction. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units. Totaling $750 million at an average price per share of $365. As of the end of Q1, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.06x and stood at 4.16x pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction. The decline in leverage in the quarter was driven by our inability to repurchase shares in the open market until we had shareholder approval of the Liberty Broadband transaction in late February.\nWe expect to gradually increase our leverage to the middle of our 4 to 4.5x range pro forma for the Liberty transaction over the next several quarters. As we laid out last quarter, our plan is to grow EBITDA in 2025, and with strong contributions from the mobile business as well as continuing efficiency improvements driven by our investments, we made good progress against that plan in the Q1. As we continue to grow the business financially, we will also see outsized improvements to free cash flow driven by the end of our major one-time investments in our network evolution and subsidized rural initiatives.\nThat reduction in capital spending from approximately $12 billion in 2025 to less than $8 billion in 2028 is equivalent to over $25 of annual free cash flow per share based on today's share count. Ultimately, the strength of our P&L and decline in capital intensity over the next several years, combined with our appropriate balance sheet management and resulting share buyback, will drive stronger returns for shareholders for many years. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the Raise hand button which can be found on the black bar at the bottom of your screen. When it is your turn, you will receive a message on your screen from the host allowing you to talk and then you will hear your name called. Please accept, unmute your audio and ask your question. As a reminder, we are allowing analysts to ask one question today. We will wait one moment to allow the queue to form. Our first question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi. Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, can you just talk about the differences that you're seeing in the converged households where you've got wireless now. And, if you could also, by the way, update us on what the attach rate is since we have individual lines but not penetration of households. But what kind of differences are you seeing in your churn rate? Is wireless really benefiting your broadband numbers now that it's reached some level of scale. And then, just quickly, Jessica, perhaps you could just let us know whether you think tariffs will have any impact on capital spending and your ability and cost of securing equipment for capital projects.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So let me tackle the first one and then, you know, we can together tackle the second one. The converged household difference. We've talked about it before, Craig. There is a substantial difference in the internet churn rate for a customer who also takes mobile lines. To the extent they have more mobile lines, it's even better. To the extent that supported mobile lines, it's even better. To the extent they have, you know device that they finance the rest, it's even better.\nSo, incrementally, it goes to those degrees; however, and we are getting a good reasonable penetration on internet, so what I'm about to say starts to lose some of its weight. However, there's a natural tendency for customers who are already going to churn less from internet to be attracted to taking more of your products. And so there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We try not to get too far over our skis in estimating the benefit of that churn reduction to internet. It is significant. Some of it is based on happy customers to begin with.\nBut you know, when you look through the scale that we have today, it is clear that it's not just self-fulfilling prophecy, that there is dramatic benefits to our customer base of having that. Part of the reason is it isn't just product convergence that is driving that. It's really value convergence. We're saving these customers hundreds and even thousands of dollars. There is a technology convergence which allows you to have a faster mobile product because of the combination with our Wi-Fi and increasingly the CBRS. And so that creates a product variation that's positive for us.\nBut there's also, as a newcomer to the mobile space, the ability for us to save these customers hundreds and thousands of dollars. And so that drives penetration, and drives satisfaction, and it drives lower churn for the existing internet relationship as well. You know, we're seeing an improved ability to use Spectrum Mobile from an acquisition standpoint. For years that's been the goal. And so we're starting to see not only the benefits of using mobile for churn reduction, but also in acquisition. We've often talked about the mobile penetration. I don't have that in front of me.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, I think just under 20% of our internet customers are mobile customers today.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThen on the tariff question, do you want to start off?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, I mean, I said it in our prepared remarks, Craig. I don't expect tariffs to have a meaningful sort of overall impact on our capital expenditures. That was part of the reason that I was able to reiterate our guide for the year at $12 billion and our multi-year CapEx outlook, even including what we expect for the impact of tariffs today.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood. Look, I agree with all that. If you take a step back, I'd just highlight Charter's as an American company offering services to more than 57 million. US families and businesses. We have 100% US-based workforce. And so naturally, you know, Craig, our preference is to buy American-made products when they're available and when they're priced competitively. Saying the obvious, I think tariff imbalances are by definition unfair.\nYou know, clearly President Trump has taken a strong stand that at least from the outside it appears to be creating an important opportunity for other countries to lower their tariffs, eliminate trade barriers, and from our perspective to benefit US workers like ours and our US-based customers. But again, stating the obvious, we hope that can all happen soon, and we're hoping that's the case.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nSenior Managing Director, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks Craig. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Chris, could you update us on the rollout of seamless entertainment? I think we were waiting for some progress on the digital store front and folding in some new apps, but just any help you can give in terms of the timing, what that product will look like. It seems as if you guys are expecting some further improvement in some of your underlying KPIs, whether it's video or broadband? So, could you flesh that out little bit, and is there a way to size the impact that we can expect to see? Thanks.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So let's go through the steps that I talked about the past couple of quarters. The first is to get to these direct-to-consumer apps which are included now as part of our Spectrum TV Select services launched in front of customers so that they could actually activate to the extent they were looking for it on Spectrum.net or My Spectrum App. That has now been complete for. All but two of the apps which are remaining, which I believe is Discovery+ and BET+. But the most recent launches were Peacock and AMC+, and I'm sure I'll forget a couple along the way.\nBut now it means you've got Disney+, you've got ESPN+, you've got ViX, you've got Max, you've got Peacock, Paramount+, Tennis Channel, all of which either through TV Everywhere or through DTC authentication on those two platforms, Spectrum.net or My Spectrum App, you can go authenticate those as a customer. Get the ad-supported version of those today. The second piece that we were looking to implement was the ability for customers to seamlessly upgrade those ad-supported, I think I said ad-free, ad-supported DTC apps to upgrade those to ad-free for the incremental dollars of retail value.\nThat is taking place and for the most part is implemented for those apps that have been launched as well. All that's available today in a much easier format. It's not always consistent based on the credential requirements and authentication requirements of the program, but at least it's much more user-friendly today than it was just a couple months ago. And so we're making real progress there. The digital store that we've talked about will be launching a little bit later this year, which enables all of that to be put together in an even more seamless way, but also to sell these direct-to-consumer apps to our broadband customers on the increment as well.\nAnd manage your subscription in and out, including DTC direct-consumer ad-supported inclusion, upgrade to ad-free, selling these apps to broadband customers, and upgrading into packages that will allow you to have more value inside these direct-to-consumers. So it's all making progress. We are at a stage where we're feeling more comfortable of driving that into the marketplace. Those who live in footprint, particularly for investors, New York City and Los Angeles, keep an eye out for advertising that will be highlighting the benefits to customers of our video products of being able to include these services.\nAnd I think the really exciting part is having the support of the programmers to help drive and understand that Spectrum internet is the best place to be able to get these apps and that these apps are included as part of your service for Spectrum TV Select. Really, we've gotten the programmers to come behind us. And so you'll see advertising that's really compelling, helping support the Spectrum products from Disney, from Max, from Paramount+, all that's in market today. It's compelling, and it recognizes that the best place for customers to get all this value is through Spectrum.\nThe best place for programmers to get the value to them is really to have all these services bundled together to the extent a customer can afford it. And so I'm excited the video product because of where we've gotten to it. It's not necessarily cheap because of all the rate increases that the programs took historically, but now there's real value inside there. When you combine that with the utility of Xumo, it gives you the ability to save significant amounts of money. We now have $80 and more of value that comes in from the inclusion of these apps as part of your TV Select service. And so we're excited about it.\nSo to answer your question, we haven't started to aggressively market that yet. We'll start to see some of that coming around. I don't think that the improvement in video that you've seen so far is uniquely driven by these apps inclusions as of yet. I would hope that it gets better. The reason our video performance is better is because we've been ahead of the new pricing and packaging that bundles in, that allows us to present a lower internet price both at promotion and retail when you bundle video.\nThe reason that we're able to do that is because we had more confidence in the value of the video product that we were putting in front of customers, and we felt good about standing behind the products that we offer. And that's a real testament to the programmers who've worked with us over the past year and a half to get to that space. I think we're on a good trajectory and it's a little unknown. I call it option value. The biggest driver here for us is obviously internet and mobile, but I think our video results can improve, and I think we're offering a compelling product, and at a minimum, it's something that we're proud to put on the bill now and to use together with broadband.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nChris, do you think the launch of the service also will benefit the trends on the broadband side along with video?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nI think over time that is certainly the goal. If for no other reason, that by bundling in mobile and video it allows us to have a lower presented price for internet both at promotion and retail, and have lower roll-offs, in terms of promotional roll-offs, which benefits not only at acquisition, but service transactions over time, and churn over time as well. So it was an elegant way to get us into an environment where we could, despite having a secured product, present a lower price than our competitors because of the all-in value that we could provide to the household, which is unique.\nNone of our competitors are able to have internet and mobile everywhere they operate. None of our competitors are able to actually offer that bundled together with video and importantly, save customers hundreds or thousands of dollars on mobile and provide them a video product that can potentially reduce their bill compared to what they're paying through those relative of direct-to-consumer apps that they're paying for or not paying for through unauthorized credentials.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, John. Operator. We'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nHey, Jonathan, you might be on mute.\n\nOperator\n\nJonathan, your line is open. You'll just need to unmute on your side, but please feel free to go ahead. Why don't we go to our next question, and we'll return to Jonathan. For our next question, we will hear from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, can you hear me?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYes. Hey, Ben.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Great. Chris, I'm sure you're aware there's a lot of focus right now, certainly in the investment community in the industry, on kind of promotions and promotional roll-off. This is not new, but something that Charter has been doing for a long time, and we can sort of see in your results now. I think the success you're having in kind of rolling off some of the Spectrum One promotions and driving faster revenue growth in mobile and broadband.\nI'm just wondering if you could talk about why it's working well for you in this environment and maybe more importantly why you think you can continue to execute that approach with your new Life Unlimited plans in a market that seems to be increasingly focused on kind of price locks and all-in pricing? I guess you're confident that it's the right strategy because the revenues are there. As you can tell from the questions, people are still looking for broadband to get better on the KPI front. But I'd love to just get your thoughts given where we are in the market around promo, promo rolloff, pricing, packaging, and the competitive environment.\nI just wanted to ask Jessica anything you'd want to give us in terms of OpEx outlook for the year that's different from the end of the Q4 call sticking, maybe cost to service and other expenses seem to be trending nicely for you year-on-year. Just any update, if you have any, would be helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nOn the promotions and roll-offs. You know, that's a very deep and extensive topic, so I'll do my best to cover a bit of it. I think first and foremost you have to have the very best product in terms of speed and reliability. The second is that you have to create value for customers and save them money, whether that's at promotion or at retail. The third is, yes, we do really use promotional pricing to drive acquisition, but even when you're at retail, it needs to stick. You need to minimize the promotional roll-offs that you have because it drives service transactions.\nCustomer dissatisfaction can result in churn, particularly if that retail price doesn't deliver the value relative to your competition. So while at Charter we had, we believe, the lowest prices across cable, when you get into retail rate pricing, we're looking for a way that said, is there an elegant way to migrate to lower pricing at retail for internet, including, you know, primarily bundled, but also including for single-play products in a way that was not tearing apart the existing base of revenue that we have.\nThe way to do that is to use the products that we have that are competitive advantage, which is mobile. Now given the work that we've done with video to say when you bundle together, you can have at a promotional rate $40 Gig, which will have low rollout, which will have first and foremost your basic price lock, two years if you bundle with two types of products, and three-year price lock if you bundle with three products. Even when you're out of that and you have two years of promotional roll-off, so five years down the road you're at a price point that is still very competitive in the marketplace and offers a better product and more value whether it's bundled or not.\nThat's where we put ourselves in a position to do so in a way that was still that works well for customers and works well for our shareholders as well. That's, you know, without spending 30 minutes on it, that's the essence of our strategy and to put more product and value in. So when you think about driving in with Gig as opposed to just our 500 Mb per second, using the strengths that we have, putting in the Unlimited Plus version of the product when you're bundled together with Gig and putting in the Cloud DVR is included as part of the service, as well as the Xumo box when you're bundling in that triple play.\nSo it's more than just the amount of PSUs, it's the depth and the quality of the product that we're willing to add in and contribute into that bundle as you move upstream. And it drives quality into the customer base and protects them from churn as these small step-ups occur. And most importantly, when you get to retail pricing, because it's a product set, pricing, and packaging that cannot be replicated in the marketplace because of how we approach the market. And then, if you can combine that with high-quality service. The goal is to have this customer for life. I think we had always done a pretty good job of all those things I said. But we had an opportunity to do even better.\nThat's what the pricing and packaging that we launched in September enabled us to do. I think it's early days, and I think the real value of what we've done last September you won't see until you start to get into year, you know, beyond year one as you have roll-offs that are less or, in fact, you know, bundled price locks that are taking place, which means you have even lower amounts of calls, lower amounts of churn, and then for many years to come, you'll have a compounding effect of those lower service transactions and lower churn because there's more value inside that bundle and there's more customers who are bundled.\nDoes that make sense?\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nOn the operating expenses side, Ben, you know, we had a little more volatility in the quarter in the growth rate for marketing and residential sales, but I still anticipate over the course of the year that line will grow in the low- to mid-single digits. In the same place that we were before on programming cost per video customer and cost to service customer where cost to service customers where I would expect it to be flat to slightly down for the year. In other expense, I think we hadn't given a suggestion there. I think absent the one-time item in this quarter, I would just note that other expense is a space where we sometimes do encounter one-time items over the course of the year.\nAbsent those, I would have expected, you know, also a low- to mid-single-digit growth rate and other expense. But I'll call out that it's subject to those one-time items.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nOperator. We'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question, we'll return to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please unmute your line and go ahead. Jonathan, I see that you are unmuted. You may need to select a different microphone input.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street Research\n\nSorry, can you hear me now?\n\nOperator\n\nWe can. Yes, we can.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street Research\n\nSorry about that. Chris, I'd love to just delve a little bit more into the Life Unlimited pivot that you guys made back in September. I think this is sort of a really important moment for the company. When we look at our Recon Analytics data on NPS, it looks like there's a steady improvement since September. I'd love to get a perspective of how that sort of matches your internal tracking. Then I know that you said in response to the earlier question the real benefits we'll see over time. I'm wondering what sort of you're seeing in early life churn on the customers that are on the Life Unlimited package relative to what you've seen before, and sort of signals that give you confidence in that future improvement?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So what you had just asked there is what I would call young, early tenured customer retention rate is better post the launch of the bundled pricing and packaging in September, which is what you would expect. So that answers the question there. I think as I was talking through Ben, the real benefit of this won't be fully recognized until we get beyond year one, into year two, and into year three. I think even going into years four and five, you'll see the benefit of that.\nWe are looking at ways, when customers call in under what I call legacy pricing and packaging, ways to migrate them into this new Spectrum pricing and packaging in a way that delivers them a much higher level of value at the same or slightly higher price point, but giving them a tremendously higher amount of product. Doing so because we can and because it preserves margin for us and puts that customer in a much better relationship. So maybe there's a chance that even prior to the September one-year expiration that we can start to actively migrate customers into Spectrum pricing and packaging that was launched at the same time as the Life Unlimited branding.\nThat may give us an opportunity to do more with that legacy customer or existing customer base earlier. As it relates to NPS, there are so many different factors going in. You can have great, improving NPS and then you can have a small rate increase that puts a ding into that. But I do agree, generally we see the same overall trend that Net Promoter Score is increasing. That's a function of the pricing and packaging. That's the function of the quality and the reliability of the product.\nIt's also a function of the changes we've made with our customer commitment and some of the softer things that we've done inside of the call centers to make sure our customers know that the employee that they're speaking to genuinely is an employee, and is based here in the US and that we appreciate the time the customers had with us, and really their commitment to us as Spectrum. And so we've made a lot of changes in that environment too. And standing behind the product credits, providing that transparency, and proactively providing credits when we do miss the mark, it goes a long way.\nAll those things put together is how you get Net Promoter Score to go up. So, value, reliability, great service, recognition, US-based employee that we have 100% for sales and service infrastructure, which I don't think we touted enough. And, I think all that is working to your point. I think it's very early days, and I think you'll see bumps along the road, but the overall trend should be going up and to the right.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street Research\n\nChris, if there's no change in market growth or the competitive environment from what we're seeing right now, the improvements that you expect in year two, three, four, et cetera, do you think those are enough to get you back to positive broadband subscriber growth?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nI do.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nAnalyst, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a bit of an update on what you see in terms of the broader consumer behavior in your base. One of your peers sort of called out higher mobile substitution in some of their cohorts. I'm wondering if you're seeing any of those effects, but then more broadly maybe talk about any consumer trade down effects, pressure, and credit metrics, although they didn't seem to show up this quarter in any way. Just kind of wondering what you're hearing anecdotally from the consumer side based on all the sort of macro uncertainty we have right now. Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Look, I don't think what we're seeing is that different, and I'll come to that. But I just want to be clear. Our sales are up, and our churn is relatively stable despite the higher non-pay disconnect that Jessica mentioned. So we feel good about our own trends. The factors that are going into broadband industry growth right now, the end of ACP, it's largely behind us. I assume that's the same for the industry as a whole. As you mentioned, mobile substitution, including some low-end cell phone internet migration, is almost back to where it was pre-pandemic. So it's continuing.\nBut my hope is that slows and gets back to where it was, and that's our expectation. So both of those I think are going our direction in terms of industry growth. One of the big bogeys here is, you know, we'll have to see where the housing market goes. And that's always been a contributor to broadband industry growth. That hasn't changed. So the first two I mentioned, end of ACP, mobile substitution reversion, I think are going our direction. The housing climate is a little bit unknown right now, and that will have an impact, but even that tends to be temporary in nature.\nAnd then the other thing that you asked about is essentially, I think, the market climate really is a recession question. We have not seen anything significant with the consumer so far and neither in non-pay disconnect rates. They're up slightly, only because of the lack of ACP. I would say in a market environment where customers are rightfully tightening their wallet, our strategy, go back and think about what I just said with Ben and Jonathan. Our strategy of having the very best products and service at attractive prices and focusing on saving customers money.\nIf you look at that slide, that's in the presentation that we had today, it's huge money. And so, in any environment, but particularly in a recessionary environment, I think our products and our pricing works very well across all environments. I think even in a recession we can present value to customers and stickiness through having the best products at the best prices. Advertising and telling customers you can save them hundreds or even thousands of dollars on converged broadband and mobile services is a great way.\nIf you can put together the video package, whether it's through skinny bundles or through really full, when I say full, meaning linear live video plus all of the direct-consumer app bundles in a way that creates value and saves you money in a recessionary environment. I think you're in a good position. I just add one final thing to that. We do have, and we're proud of that, is a variety of packages that meet the needs of low-income or income-constrained consumers. We always have, and we target that market to make sure that we're servicing all areas of our communities.\nSo I don't have a crystal ball on the economy, but I think we're pretty well positioned for potential headwinds in the recessionary environment, if that's what's coming. Like I said, I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not predicting that. I'm just saying that we're in a pretty good spot.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jim. Operator, we'll take our final question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, can you hear m okay?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nHey Bryan.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. I just have a question on fiber competition. Would you be able to give us a sense for the difference in your broadband penetration levels in markets where you've competed with fiber for a long time relative to the non-fiber markets? Are you splitting the market 50/50 in those areas after you kind of take out the portion captured by fixed wireless at this point? Also specifically in the older markets, has it been stable as of late or is competitive fiber still gaining share in those areas? Just trying to get some more color there, if you wouldn't mind sharing that. Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nIt's been a while, but we've provided color on this in the past. When we have new fiber overbuilders inside of our markets, we have a few penetration points of rollback. That's been the case. Still the case. And so it's just a question of mix and newness of fiber rollout and the pace of fiber rollout has been about the same. So when you think about all of the market dynamics that are impacting our internet growth rate because that fiber overbuild has been there for more than a decade, the impact of fiber has been consistent and steady. It's really more about the mobile substitution and the introduction of a new low-end competitor with cell phone internet.\nThose have been the two big drivers and just market size because of all the things that we've been talking about through this call. So the other thing I would tell you about fiber penetration is at least inside of our footprint, which goes to your question of 50/50 split. That's not what we see. It's never been what we see. It's not what we see today. And so when you hear other companies talk about the type of penetrations that they are getting, all I can say is they must be having outsized penetration in non-Charter markets because we don't see a 50/50 split.\nSerious sales continuing even after a tenured-year rollout of the fiber overbuild of having higher penetration than 50/50 of the broadband penetration inside those markets.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Thanks Chris for that color. I appreciate it.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Bryan. That concludes our call. Thanks everyone. Layla, I'll pass it back to you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining the call today. We have now concluded and you may disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com.\nI would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results.\nAny forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. As a reminder, all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. In 2024, we managed the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program successfully. Outside of normal turn, we kept roughly 90% of former ACP customers connected.\nSpectrum Mobile business continued to grow at a rapid rate. We added over 2 million Spectrum Mobile lines in 2024. We're the fastest-growing mobile provider in the U.S. with the fastest connectivity at the best price. Our expansion initiative continued to deliver good passings growth, driven by our subsidized rural initiative and normal construction and fill-in activity.\nIn 2024, we grew revenue by 1%, while full year EBITDA growth accelerated to 3.1% driven by continued strong mobile growth, our cost efficiency initiatives and political advertising.\nLate last year and early this year, we had unexpected natural disasters from Hurricane Helene impacting Florida, the Carolinas and the broader Southeast; with Hurricane Milton across Central Florida; and most recently, to Las Angeles fires. There are, of course, subscriber and financial impacts, which Jessica will cover, but our employees work and live in these communities, so it's also personal.\nStories of our frontline employees commitment about, including employees helping to reestablish connectivity for customers despite losing their own homes and countless employees traveling in from other regions to stay and to help. Really proud of how our frontline employees have responded. And from Stanford, we learned some lessons on how to put customers at center, and we got better for communications along the way. Part of our customer commitment is to always improve and we are.\nAs we look to 2025 and beyond, the environment for broadband, mobile and video remains competitive, but we had better visibility than this time last year. The impact of the elimination of the ACP is now behind us. cellphone Internet net additions appear to have peaked or be stabilized, and we continue to do well against new fiber overlap.\nIn the meantime, we haven't stayed still, sets us up well for the future. Our multiyear investment initiatives, including network evolution, network expansion and execution, including the investment to employees and tenure to benefit our service, are all delivering tangible results. And last September, we relaunched the Spectrum brand and its promise to customers through Life Unlimited.\nWith our first -- our market first, customer service commitment and making better use of our unique assets through converged seamless connectivity across 100% of our network, and now seamless entertainment and video. The positive impacts from our customer commitment and brand refresh investments take time to be recognized, but you can already see the positive effect from our new pricing and packaging in video results.\nIn late 2022, we launched a number of strategic initiatives and communicated a significant onetime capital investment to enhance our growth potential long term. While the investments put temporary pressure on our near-term free cash flow growth, these were a unique set of nonrecurring and generational industry investments, and they include the largest broadband expansion since the 1980s, the largest physical upgrade of the network since the 1990s. Market-leading convergence of our wireline and wireless capabilities and an exciting video transformation, which will help drive our connectivity business.\n2025 will have a slightly higher level of investment than 2024, but this year will also be our key capital investment. So this is a fitting time to highlight where our strategy leaves us competitively, operationally and financially for the coming years.\nWe have a unique set of assets and in scale as shown on Slide 4. Spectrum has the fastest Internet, the best WiFi, the fastest mobile product and is the leading video provider in the U.S. with over 900,000 miles of network infrastructure, 57 million residential and SMB passings, and over 300,000 fiber-lit buildings. Of course, we have significant competition from wireline overbuild, cellphone Internet and satellite across all of our products.\nThe power of our network, though, continues to improve with symmetrical and multi-gig feeds, allowing product developers to create applications and use cases that require high capacity, low latency, high reliability and edge compute. Product and software developers can rely on the ubiquitous deployment across all the major cable networks in the U.S. So we're very well positioned. In fact, it's always been the U.S. cable companies that have built the fully deployed platforms that have enabled the development of next-generation products and services, despite the handicap of being regional operators competing against national and now global competitors.\nThe ability to provide the very best of our products across our entire footprint is unique. That includes new features we're developing for seamless connectivity and seamless entertainment. Convergence is a popular phrase amongst our competitors now. And while it's flattering to hear our own wording adopted by others, Slide 5 of our presentation today speaks for itself. We are very underpenetrated relative to our converged connectivity capabilities.\nHaving the best network and product capabilities by itself isn't enough, and that's why we've always focused on the ability to have the most value in our packages, combining the best products with ways for customers to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year, whether a promotion or retail prices. By the time you have new entrants, consumers can be enticed to try to provider even at lower quality and higher all-in prices. But in the long term, we believe the best products and best pricing across a package of those services will win.\nAnd Slide 6 of our presentation is an example of that advantage across typical broadband and mobile packages. Together with our upcoming seamless entertainment offers, highlighting this value is the goal of our recent pricing and packaging under the Life Unlimited brand refresh.\nI spoke about the sequencing of our seamless entertainment launches on last quarter's call, and that timing in 2025 hasn't changed, so I won't repeat the steps and priorities. But we look forward to fully rolling that out in the first half of this year and delivering even more value to consumers, up to $80 of retail app value when subscribing to our video packages.\nThat customer proposition is shown on Slide 7 of our presentation. Similar to mobile, taking video as part of the package now ensures a lower price for Internet, both at promotion and retail. And of course, we couple all that with high-quality service. We've always believed that investing in customer service and satisfaction creates a virtuous cycle in our business. Better customer service translates to fewer customer transactions. Fewer transactions produces higher customer satisfaction and lower churn. Lower churn reduces cost and increases in penetration. And lower cost gives us the ability to offer better pricing, which works for customer acquisition, search and satisfaction and positions us for growth.\nOur sales and service is 100% U.S.-based, made in America, if you will, using our own employees with good paying jobs and benefits. Employees are also Spectrum customers committed to developing their local communities and their career at this company. That is a competitive advantage. An investment we already made in wages, benefits in real estate that's difficult to replicate. And that existing investment is also why it was so easy for us to make our marketing customer commitments. We stand behind our commitments to service credits when we missed the mark. As a reminder, we've provided a summary of those commitments on Slide 8.\nFor years, we've been investing in machine learning and now AI, and much of our effort is making front live work easier and more efficient, which drives higher customer and employee satisfaction. Some of those examples include full service, network, CPE and billing telemetry on the account, which is automatically presented to an agent now when answering the phone.\nIn addition, AI is also listening to the conversation, providing proactive optimized solutions, customer sentiment, ChatGPT style technical support, call summarization, and flagging post-call trading opportunities. AI call summarization also helps the field technician assess the issue before they even get to the door, improving the customer interaction. And that's in addition to rolling out our own ChatGPT on their handheld devices to more accurately pinpoint issues and recommend the best fix to the field tech.\nWe do have millions of transactions every year. And honestly, there aren't millions of best outcomes. So transactions can be more effective, it can be shortened and reduced, driving higher customer satisfaction and lower churn. But also higher employee satisfaction, which drives lower attrition or tenure, and therefore, better service, which, of course, produces less transactions as a result.\nTaken together, that is our strategy and competitive positioning: the best network, best products, the most value with unmatched service, having more household penetration, higher product penetration for household, lower service transactions and churn, and lower operating and capital cost per customer, which allows us to have the lowest pricing a virtuous cycle.\nThe financial output is high-quality revenue per home passed with free cash flow growth and high return on investment. But we're not perfect and we've always got room for better execution and speed, but I believe we have a great recipe for growth of our existing products with the investments we've already made. And we have strategic assets in our network, in our fully U.S.-based sales and service employees. Those will enable future products and revenue streams and operational efficiencies that aren't even considered in our financial plans today.\nIn the meantime, we positioned the company for customer profitability growth, clear visibility to free cash flow growth and improving capital allocation and return philosophy. This is a winning formula. It's with a fully dedicated and a hungry team. So we're excited about 2025 and beyond.\nAnd with that, let me hand it over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to mention that today's results include a number of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton impacts, which hit the Southeast U.S. in late September and early October. Our fourth quarter customer results include over 20,000 additional disconnects related to the storms.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was reduced by approximately $35 million, primarily driven by hurricane-related customer credits and revenue, and the storms drove approximately $125 million in total incremental capital expenditures in the fourth quarter. Today's results do not include any related to the wildfires that hit Southern California in January. Our first quarter results will include some lost customers and passings related to the fires. We're still assessing impacted area, and we expect to incur capital expenditures to recover and rebuild loss passings.\nWe've been providing bill credits to customers in impacted areas, and those onetime credits will offset some first quarter revenue. We may also have some incremental operating expense, although we expect that to be relatively small. And we'll isolate the impact of the fires when we report our first quarter results.\nUnrelated, we recently completed an extensive review of our serviceable passings to clean up duplicate acne and other data and to identify new passings. As a result, we reduced total estimated passings in our trending schedule for all periods presented by 1.7 million passings. Additionally, because of the GAAP requirement, our cost to service customers expense line has been divided into 2 new cost lines, field and technology operations and customer operations.\nThe best way to forecast these 2 allied items is to combine them into 1 figure as presented in the past as cost to service customers, and that's how I will refer to them today when reviewing our expense results.\nLet's please turn to our customer results on Slide 10. Including residential and SMB, we lost 177,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter. In mobile, we added 529,000 lines. Video customers declined by 123,000, with the improvement driven by the rebundling we launched in September, along with our Life Unlimited brand refresh. Video performance does not yet reflect the benefits of incorporating seamless entertainment apps in our product. Voice customers declined by 270,000.\nIn addition to the 20,000 Internet disconnects driven by the hurricanes, the end of the ACP program drove higher fourth quarter nonpay and voluntary churn among former ACP customers. For a total estimated fourth quarter ACP impact of approximately 140,000 Internet losses, primarily nonpay and some voluntary churn. Looking forward, we believe we are past the onetime ACP-related impacts to our customers.\nBeyond ACP and hurricane impacts, we were generally pleased with our fourth quarter customer results and core Internet results, which exclude ACP and storm-related losses were better than last year. We continue to compete well across our footprint.\nAs Chris discussed, we continue to pursue initiatives that are intended to drive customer and financial growth, including network evolution, new pricing and packaging, converged connectivity product development and footprint expansion, including our subsidized roll initiatives. As of year-end, we have launched symmetrical 1-gigabit speeds in all 8 of our step 1 markets. Earlier this year, we launched 2 x 1 gigabit service in 2 of these markets, Lexington, Kentucky and Cincinnati. And we plan to launch 2-by-1service in additional markets later this year.\nDemand for faster Internet speeds continues to grow as data usage grows. In the fourth quarter, monthly data usage by our residential Internet customers who don't have our traditional video product, reached over 100 gigabytes. Our WiFi also continues to improve, driven by our advanced WiFi product and our new WiFi 7 router. Our WiFi supports our converged connectivity product, including Spectrum Mobile, which is only at about 8% of passings but remains the fastest-growing mobile service in the United States and offers the fastest overall speeds.\nTurning to rural. We ended the quarter with a total of 813,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 117,000 in the fourth quarter and by nearly 400,000 over the last 12 months. And we generated 41,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. 2025 customer growth should benefit from 2024 rural passings growth as well as passing growth in 2025. We expect rural passings growth of approximately $450,000 in 2025, our biggest year so far, in addition to continued nonrural construction and fill-in activity.\nMoving to fourth quarter revenue results on Slide 11. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 2.2%, while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.7% year-over-year given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile. Those factors were partly offset by a higher mix of nonvideo customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, $34 million of hurricane-related residential customer credits and $37 million of costs, which accounting principles required to be allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue.\nAs Slide 11 shows, in total, residential revenue declined 5.4%. Turning to commercial. Total commercial revenue grew by 1.9% year-over-year, with SMB revenue growth of 0.3%, reflecting higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer primarily due to rate adjustments. Enterprise revenue grew by 4.4%, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.2%. And when excluding wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.2%.\nFourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 26%, given political revenue growth. Excluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 8.2% due to a more challenged national and local advertising market. Other revenue grew by 14.6%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 1.6% year-over-year, and 1% when excluding advertising revenue and hurricane-related customer credits.\nMoving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses grew by 0.3% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.1% due to an 8.7% decline in video customers year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, along with $37 million cost, which accounting principles required to be allocated to programmer streaming apps and netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nOther costs of revenue increased by 16.2%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales, mobile service direct costs as well as higher advertising sales expense related to higher political revenue. Cost to service customers, which combine field and technology operations and customer operations, declined 0.5% year-over-year given productivity from our 10-year investments, including lower labor costs.\nSales and marketing costs grew by 3.2% as we remain focused on driving customer acquisition and given our Life Unlimited brand relaunch in September. Finally, other expenses declined by 0.7%.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 3.4% year-over-year in the quarter and by 1.8% when excluding advertising. As we look ahead to the full year 2025, we faced headwinds that we didn't last year, including the lack of political advertisement and the full year impact from the prior year Internet customer losses, primarily due to the end of ACP, but our plan is to grow adjusted EBITDA in this year.\nTurning to net income. We generated $1.5 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter compared to $1.1 billion last year, given this quarter's higher adjusted EBITDA and a larger pension remeasurement loss in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 13. Capital expenditures totaled $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up about $200 million from last year's fourth quarter. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiatives and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities.\nFourth quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $2 billion, about $130 million higher than last year. The increase was mostly driven by CPE due to purchase timing and higher scalable infrastructure spend. 2024 capital expenditures totaled $11.3 billion, less than our original expectation for $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion, given lower network evolution and line extension spending, both due to timing.\nWe expect total 2025 capital expenditures to reach approximately $12 billion, including line extension spend of approximately $4.2 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.5 billion. On Slide 14, we've provided our current expectations for capital spending through the year 2028, excluding any line extension spending associated with the beat program as we are still in the early stages of bidding, and we have a lower appetite to bid due to regulatory conditions.\nOur current multiyear CapEx outlook is largely unchanged in total versus our prior outlook, with retiming across years and slight changes across categories. We expect total line extension capital expenditures to decline after 2025, even inclusive of beat. You wouldn't expect to be more than a few hundred million dollars per year 4 years starting in 2026. And our RTO build is still expected to be completed by the end of 2026, 2 years ahead of schedule.\nWe now expect our total network evolution initiative capital to reach $5.4 billion over the period 2024 to 2027 versus $4.6 million previously, given our full plant walk out and the finalization of more detailed project plans. Looking beyond 2025, we expect total capital spending in dollar terms to be on a meaningful downward trajectory, even inclusive of beat spending. And after our evolution and expansion capital initiatives conclude, our run rate capital expenditures should be below $8 billion per year.\nJust to highlight, that reduction in capital expenditures on its own from approximately $12 billion in 2025 to less than $8 billion in 2028, is equivalent to $25 of annual free cash flow per share based on today's share count. And while we always prioritize our free cash flow for organic opportunities first and then accretive M&A and buybacks, there are currently no organic capital expenditure opportunities on the horizon that give us concern with that capital expenditures outlook.\nFourth quarter free cash flow totaled $984 million, a decrease of approximately $80 million compared to last year's fourth quarter. The decline was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, cash taxes and cash interest, partly offset by a larger cable working capital benefit driven by the implementation of our supply chain financing program and higher EBITDA in this year's fourth quarter.\nJust a brief comment on 2025 cash taxes. We currently expect under existing tax legislation that our calendar year 2025 cash tax payments will total between $1.6 billion and $2 billion.\nWe finished the quarter with $93.8 billion in debt principal. In December, we financed -- we refinanced most of our 2027 maturity tower, extending about $13 billion of our credit facilities to 2030 and 2031. After that refinancing, our maturities in each of the next 3 years are less than $4 billion per year. Our weighted average cost of debt remains very attractive at 5.2%, partly driven by our long-dated fixed rate profile.\nOur current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.9 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 292,000 Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $113 million at an average price of $384 per share. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.13x and stood at 4.24x pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction.\nOur leverage ratio may decline further given our pause and buybacks, but we are still targeting the midpoint of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range, though now pro forma for the pending Liberty Broadband transaction. We look forward to resuming our open market buyback program following the shareholder vote for the Liberty Broadband transaction scheduled for February '26.\nAs laid out, we've invested in a strong platform for growth, which we expect to see materialize across the business over the last -- over the next several years. And as our capital spending peaks this year, we are poised for strong free cash flow growth and shareholder returns.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A.",

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn over the call to Stefan Anninger.\nAll right, let's try that again. Thanks, Operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, in-charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Stefan. During Q2, we lost 149,000 internet customers, most of which was driven by the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program. We added over 550,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.2 million lines year over year. Revenue was up slightly in the quarter, while Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6%. We put a lot of effort into the ACP program, and it wasn't renewed. Beginning early this year, we've been actively working with customers to preserve their connectivity. Our service and retention teams are handling the volume of calls well, and we've retained the vast majority of ACP customers so far. The real question is customers' ability to pay, not just now, but over time. I expect we'll have a better view of the total ACP impact once we're inside Q4.\nThe lack of ACP will also drive higher levels of market churn and selling opportunities for connectivity services over time. Turning back to today's results, the second quarter already tends to be a seasonally weak quarter. The loss of ACP impacted both churn and low-income broadband connects, helping drive the mobile-only broadband category back to pre-pandemic levels. That shift added to an already low level of move activity and overall market connect volume. That said, we performed better than our expectations for internet in the quarter, and we competed well compared to previous quarters against both wireline overbuild and cell phone internet, each with expanded footprints. Overall churn remains at low levels even with the end of the ACP program, and we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile.\nWe expect market activity and selling opportunities to pick up over time, and the cell phone companies will face challenges as customer bandwidth demands continue to grow. If we take a step back, our success will be premised on our high-capacity, fully deployed network and the products it can deliver. We already have a 1-gigabit network everywhere we operate across 58 million passings, and when our network evolution initiatives complete, we'll have a ubiquitous, symmetrical, multi-gig capable network supporting continued growth in data demand from customers and new applications such as AR, VR, and AI, all at an incremental investment of just $100 per passing. Those wireline network capabilities are combined with mobile capabilities everywhere we operate, creating the nation's first converged network, uniquely providing seamless connectivity and the fastest mobile service where 87% of traffic is delivered by our own gigabit-capable WiFi network.\nOur converged connectivity product set is poised to get better through speed upgrades and over 43 million access points, which will grow with our own and our partners' ongoing WiFi router and CBRS access point deployment. That converged network is also expanding, covering more passings as we grow our footprint with high ROI construction opportunities in both rural and non-rural areas. As we show on slide four of today's investor presentation, we are very well positioned competitively with higher quality products, lower pricing, and the ability to deliver a converged bundle of products. In internet, data usage continues to grow, and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During Q2, roughly 30% of residential internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over a terabyte of data per month, which together with overall usage is increasing.\nThis quarter, we saw the most additions to our gig speed tier ever, an area we can grow. Our mobile offering continues to evolve, driving strong results. Our second quarter mobile line net add performance was better than the first quarter results even without the incremental benefit of our free mobile retention offer to former ACP customers, and we also had our highest port-ins quarter ever. In April, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to new and existing Unlimited Plus customers. Anytime Upgrade allows Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees, and condition requirements. During the second quarter, customers increasingly chose our Unlimited Plus package priced at $40 versus $30. In April, we also launched a new repair and replacement plan for just $5 per month. That price point is very competitive and driving higher take rates.\nThese new affordable value-added services enhance our profitable growth, and competitively open access to new customer segments. Along those lines, in May, we launched our new phone balance buyout program. Now, when a customer switches to the Spectrum Mobile from another provider and purchases at least three lines, we'll pay off their existing phone balance on ported lines up to $2,500 for five lines. This new program helps multi-line mobile customer prospects with device balances at other providers to more easily switch to Spectrum Mobile. And of course, Spectrum One continues to perform well at both connect and at promotional rolloff, offering the fastest connectivity with differentiated features. Today, approximately 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. We remain underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market-leading pricing at promotion, and at retail.\nFinally, turning to video, losses continued in video, where we have seen downgrade churn from programmer rate increases we passed through. The loss of ACP in Q2 also impacted video downgrades as customers made choices based on affordability. Over the last several years, due to margin pressure from programming increases, we've moved away from selling bundles with traditional discounts. But as we look to better differentiate ourselves in a competitive marketplace, we are considering ways to better leverage our unique capabilities across our full set of products, including video, particularly now that we're adding significant value back into the video product for consumers with hybrid linear DTC bundles, more economical package choices, and with our Xumo box.\nIn May, we reached a new agreement with Paramount that gives us the ability to offer the ad-supported versions of Paramount's direct-to-consumer services, Paramount+ and BET+, to our traditional cable package customers at no additional cost. We plan to launch the Paramount DTC inclusion offer to our customers around Labor Day. Earlier this month, ViX, the leading Spanish-language DTC product from TelevisaUnivision, became available to a large number of customers with eligible Spectrum video packages at no extra cost. We launched Disney+ Basic to TV Select customers as a DTC inclusion in January, and we'll begin to offer Disney+ Premium, the ad-free version of Disney Plus, to customers as a $6 upgrade later this quarter. We also have planned to offer Hulu to our TV Select customers at the incremental retail price for Disney's Duo Basic bundle, $2, in Q4.\nSo our efforts to deploy a new hybrid DTC linear model, the first for the industry, remain on track, and we expect it to be fully deployed next year. Together with Xumo, our goal is to deliver utility and value for our customers, irrespective of how they want to view content, and better and more stable economics for programming partners. But the associated DTCs have to be part of the full package service. Customers can't be forced to pay twice. And if the DTC standalone pricing is less expensive at retail, then that's what we really should help programmers sell instead. Fundamentally, we believe that evolving the video business, even if it isn't growing, helps customer acquisition and retention, still has positive cash flow, and provides us with option value.\nAnd over time, we believe a high-quality video product gives us the opportunity to reintroduce more value into the converged connectivity relationship. So stepping back, we're executing well on many multi-year transformational programs. We're growing EBITDA despite the loss of ACP and a competitive cycle by driving efficiency without impacting our service and sales capabilities. We remain fully focused on driving growth using our unique set of scaled assets and the highest quality products and services in order to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide six. Including residential and SMB, we lost 149,000 internet customers in Q2, while in mobile, we added 557,000 mobile lines. Video customers declined by 408,000, and wireline voice customers declined by 280,000. As Chris mentioned, our Q2 internet losses were primarily driven by the end of the ACP program. ACP program connects ended in early February. In May, the program's original $30 subsidy was reduced to $14, and in June, that subsidy was reduced to zero. We estimate that the end of the program's impact on our Q2 internet gross additions and churn drove over 100,000 of our 149,000 internet losses in the quarter. From a financial perspective, there was an approximately $30 million headwind to Q2 revenue from one-time non-recurring ACP-related items in the quarter.\nIn addition, similar to the end of the Keep Americans Connected program in June 2020, many of our ACP customers had past-due balances that had been fully reserved for accounting purposes. We took steps to eliminate a portion of those back balances for certain customers and put a portion of the remaining balances on payment plans. For certain customers with a low likelihood to pay post-ACP, we have been recognizing revenue on a cash basis, resulting in slightly less revenue and less bad debt in Q2 than we would have otherwise had. So far, we're performing well with ACP retention, but the largest driver of internet customer losses associated with the end of the ACP program will be in non-pay disconnects, and they will occur in Q3 and Q4, likely weighted to Q3.\nWe continue to do everything we can to preserve connectivity for former ACP subsidy recipients. We have a number of products and offers to assist those that have lost their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program, our Internet 100 product, and we've been offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for one year. We continue to market offers targeted at low-income customers, a segment that we have historically served well. Turning to rural, we ended the quarter with 582,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 89,000 in the second quarter and by 345,000 over the last 12 months. We had 36,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024, about 50% more than in 2023.\nWe also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to Q2 financial results starting on slide seven. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 1.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.4% year over year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, and some internet ARPU compression related to retention offers extended to customers that previously received an ACP subsidy. As slide seven shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.6% year over year. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 0.6% year over year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 0.2% year-over-year and higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustments.\nEnterprise revenue grew 4.5% year over year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.1% year over year. When excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise grew by 5.9%. Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 3.3% year over year, given political revenue growth. Core ad revenue was down about 2% year over year. Other revenue grew by 6% year over year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.2% year over year and 0.1% year over year when excluding advertising revenue. Moving to operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA on slide eight. In the second quarter, total operating expenses declined by 1.4% year over year. Programming costs declined by 9.8% year over year due to a 9.5% decline in video customers year over year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nOther costs of revenue increased by 12.6%, primarily driven by mobile service direct costs and higher mobile device sales. Cost-to-service customers declined 4.2% year over year, given productivity from our tech infrastructure investments, including lower labor costs and lower bad debt expense, as we saw some favorability in our mobile bad debt as a portion of revenue due to an improved customer tenure and credit profile. As I mentioned earlier, a portion of our uncollectible billings offset revenue in the quarter. Sales and marketing costs grew by 1.9% as we remained focused on driving customer acquisition. Finally, other expense grew by 4.7%, mostly driven by an insurance expense benefit from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter. When excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year.\nWhile we don't manage the business at a single product line P&L level, we continue to compute allocations internally. This quarter, for the first time, our standalone mobile Adjusted EBITDA was positive, even when including the headwind of subscriber acquisition costs and without the benefit of GAAP revenue allocation to mobile revenue. Our mobile profitability this quarter marks a significant milestone. It shows that we're on the path to establishing a mobile business that is very profitable. Overall, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can continue to do that even as we make significant investments in the business and face a challenging competitive environment, and the end of the ACP program. Our expense management process is working with growing realization of impacts in the second quarter.\nWe continue to expect accelerating EBITDA growth in the back half of the year, given our expense management initiatives, Spectrum One promotional rolloff, and political advertising revenue. Turning to net income on slide nine, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, in line with last year, as higher adjusted EBITDA was mostly offset by higher other operating expense, primarily due to restructuring and severance costs, and net amounts of litigation settlements. Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.85 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial green sales and market fill-in opportunities.\nSecond quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.7 billion, which was similar to the prior year period. For the full year 2024, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $12 billion, down from between $12.2 and 12.4 billion previously. Our reduced outlook for 2024 capital spending reflects lower internet and video customer net additions, including the impact of the end of the ACP program, which drives lower CPE costs. We're also actively managing vendor rates and construction materials to make our capital expenditures more efficient. We still expect line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. Turning to free cash flow on slide 11, free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $630 million compared to last year's second quarter.\nThe year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher Adjusted EBITDA, lower cash taxes due to timing, and a favorable change in working capital. On that front, we've been managing the balance sheet to provide a better overall cash flow and increased flexibility. Over the last several quarters, we sold our towers portfolio, which generated almost $400 million in proceeds. We launched our EIP securitization program in the second quarter, which backs a new $1.25 billion credit facility at favorable interest rates. We've been working with our vendor base to extend our payment terms, utilizing a supply chain financing tool to support our working capital favorability. We will continue to identify and capitalize on balance sheet opportunities to help fund our unique one-time capital investments. We finished the quarter with $96.5 billion in debt principal.\nOur current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion, and we repurchased 1.5 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings Common Units, totaling $404 million at an average price of $271 per share. Given our long-dated and 86% fixed-rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $60 million. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12 months Adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.32x. We expect to continue to move closer to the middle of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year.\nWe remain fully committed to maintaining our split-rated debt structure, including access to the investment-grade market, given the significant benefits that it offers to all of our capital providers. We continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We have the best products at the best prices in our industry, and we remain underpenetrated relative to our long-term potential. That, combined with the investments that we're making in the business, and our expense savings initiative, will continue to drive strong EBITDA growth and value creation for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press Star 5 on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star 5. Again, that is Star 5 to ask a question.\nWe will pause for a moment to allow the questions to queue. Thank you. Our first question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig MofCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, thank you. Perhaps no surprise, I'd like to drill down a little bit more on the ACP impacts. A couple of questions. First, to what extent are you seeing ACP showing up in reduced gross additions? That is just lower market activity because new customers can't sign up for, or ACP customers who are moving can't continue to sign up for the program even before you start to see non-pay disconnects. And then second, what impact is it having on ARPU? You reported 1.7% broadband ARPU, the same as last quarter.\nHad it not been for ACP, could you tell us what that would have been as you're starting to now lap some of the Spectrum One discounts that were included in the numbers in the past?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Hey, Craig. I'll take the first one. Jessica, take the second. For ACP, we estimated the impact was well over 100,000 inside the quarter to net additions loss. And for us to say that means that we have a high level of confidence, probably higher than that. So half of which was from voluntary churn, and the other half was coming from reduced gross additions, as you mentioned, from low-income segments that had been connecting at a higher rate at a much lower rate once ACP disappeared. Of course, we saw some of that impact already inside of Q1, and we saw the same inside of Q2.\nSo that's the drivers inside there, about half and half. And it's really the combination of those, when I mentioned that we saw a reversion to the pre-pandemic mobile-only broadband category where you've seen that category increase, which is taking out volume from the marketplace in terms of a source of acquisition. It's temporary. It's one-time in nature. And so, as we've spoken about before, it's really about just managing through that one-time impact and trying to make sure that we're doing all the right things for preserving that base and keeping them connected, which we're doing, but also making sure that we're making the right investments and the right moves for the business-as-usual underlying growth trajectory. Jessica on ARPU?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So internet ARPU increased 1.7% year-over-year in the quarter.\nIf you adjusted, Craig, for the $30 million in one-time ACP-related items that I mentioned and for the impact of the mobile revenue allocation, that ARPU growth would have been 2.7%. I didn't incorporate the cash-basis accounting impact that I mentioned earlier. It's small. And unless those customers do end up paying at a rate that's higher than our expectation, I think it recurs in revenue going forward. But so I think you would have been above for those two items up at 2.7%.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThank you. Thanks, Craig. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I think, Chris, in the prepared remarks, you said you competed well against fixed wireless and fiber, even though their footprints are expanding.\nGiven the prevalence of what we're seeing in terms of open access and other wholesale provider getting into the mix and increasing the fiber availability, have you seen a demonstrable change in the fiber deployments year to date as you think about that insurgent or non-incumbent fiber build to some extent? And again, just trying to think about that increase in open access and wholesalers, how does it change, if at all, how you're thinking about the competitive environment on a go-forward basis in terms of other converged players or options moving into your footprint?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Look, the competitive fiber overbuild has maintained a relatively steady pace. If anything, it's slightly lower than what it had been. And so we don't see any dramatic change there. When I talked about maintaining our competitiveness, it means having a similar impact despite the fact that you have an expanding footprint.\nSo if I was being bullish, I would argue that that's an improvement as opposed to just staying steady. And so we're competing well both in the wireline overbuild space, which is more permanent, as well as the cell phone internet space as well. In terms of some of the experiments that you're seeing as it relates to wholesale access and whatnot, it's still a fiber overbuild at the end of the day, and there's still economics that need to be deployed. And those economics, in my mind, are not very good. They haven't been for decades of the economics of an overbuilder on an existing footprint. So I don't think it, A, dramatically changes the outputs that they can provide because the economics aren't any different. And B, it's really small. What you're talking about that's been done is just a very small percentage of the US footprint.\nAnd so the ability to project products both from a sales, marketing, and service perspective really is impacted by the ubiquitous nature of the technology that you have and the ability to provide those products in the marketplace. And so from our perspective, when we look at it and say what's unique about us is we have a gigabit network deployed everywhere we operate. In addition to that, we're upgrading that wireline network to have symmetrical and multi-gig speeds everywhere, not just in red line pockets, but everywhere that we operate. And then you combine that with our WiFi and CBRS capabilities and a very strategic relationship that we have with a great partner in Verizon. It gives us the ability to provide seamless connectivity, converged broadband everywhere you go inside of our footprint. And that's unique.\nThe only other operator who has those types of capabilities really is Comcast. And so I think that's the real strategic advantage for us. And it's not because we have that capability in two, three, or five percent of our footprint. We have it everywhere we operate, and it allows us to be loud in the marketplace, talk about not only the product advantages of having that seamless connectivity, but the ability to save customers hundreds and thousands of dollars really with a better product. And so I don't see anything that's really changed other than some of these joint ventures announcements that you've seen. If you really sit back and think about it from both a strategy and from a valuation perspective, I think it's flattering. It tells you the strategic asset that we have.\nIf you take a look at the slide that we have on page four of the deck today, you think about everything that I said in our capabilities, and then you think about where others are trying to go, many of the MNOs. I do think that's flattering both from a strategic, from an operating, and from a valuation perspective of what we have and what we're capable of doing. It has people's attention.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nIf I could ask a quick follow-up on wireless, I think you noted that even excluding the retention offer for the ACP subscribers, mobile lines would have been up. I mean, can you help us think about what you're seeing in terms of just the contract buyout and some of the other offers you have in the market?\nDoes your maybe go-to-market need to evolve at all, as we think about these fears or concerns about what an upgrade cycle might mean from Apple iPhone the back half of the year? Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Well, mobile wasn't just up. What I was saying is it was up quarter over quarter. We had a very good first quarter. It was clearly up even more this quarter. And if you excluded the benefit of the ACP mobile-only mobile retention offers, we still would have been better than a very strong first quarter. That reflects just the general momentum that we have, but also we have evolved the product. And so we've rolled out the Anytime Upgrade Program, which is unique in the market. We have, even though it sounds small, it's attractive to customers' service and repair function. That's, I think, competitive.\nAnd now, with the phone balance buyout program, which is also pretty unique in the marketplace, and all of those rolled out sequentially during the course of the quarter and have continued to improve our selling capabilities along the way, I think that positions us well in any market. We've not been, I think, where you were going. We've not been, and we don't intend to be in the business of subsidizing phones. But we do have really good programs that make it attractive for customers to not only come in to be a customer of Spectrum Mobile, but also to stay with us because we have the ability through the Anytime Upgrade Program to really, at a low competitive cost, keep them current with their models of phones now and in the future.\nStating the obvious, the biggest advantage here beyond just the devices really is the ability to provide a higher quality, faster mobile service, seamless connectivity, and to be able to save them hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. I mean, if you think about our pricing at $30 for unlimited and $40 for unlimited plus on one line and each incremental line, it's really competitive. It's very good. So we're happy with where we are with the product. We will continue to evolve it. I think some of those feature sets that will evolve really include things like mobile speed boost, which ties to the capabilities that we have with WiFi and wireline, and the ability to have Spectrum Mobile as an SSID.\nSo those of you in the New York and LA markets, for example, what you'll notice is as you travel outside of your home with Spectrum Mobile, an auto-authenticated attachment to Spectrum Mobile SSID, which boosts your speeds wherever you go, and it increases your access and your reliability, which is the nature of seamless connectivity.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Sebastiano. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. Two questions. One just on broadband market growth for Chris, and then one on free cash flow for Jessica. Chris, could you give us a little bit more context around the ACP impact from lower gross adds in Q1? I think you said it was sort of roughly the same as in Q2, so maybe it was 50,000.\nBut what I'm trying to get to is an understanding of what's going on with underlying growth. It looks like it actually improved for you a little bit sequentially. And so either broadband market growth in aggregate isn't getting any worse. Maybe it's getting a little better, or you're just doing better on market share relative to your competitors. And would love to understand that a little bit better. And then, Jessica, it sounded like from your discussion of working capital that this isn't a timing impact in Q2. You've changed how you manage working capital, and so you should expect to be able to sort of retain this benefit to free cash flow as we go through the year. I just wanted to confirm that.\nAnd then do you have to get all the way back to 4.2, 4.25 times leverage before you would accelerate share repurchases again? Thanks.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSo, Jonathan, there's, I think, a few derivatives inside of your questions. So let me try to give you what you're looking for in the way that we think about it. Inside of Q1, we had performed better relative to prior quarters and prior year on competitive switching. And so that was in the marketplace, so available subscriber adds and disconnects. But we saw, as you highlighted as well, once everybody had reported, we saw a significant reduction in Q1 of this year in the available gross adds, a significant drop year over year.\nThat was due to housing starts, rental vacancies, but also the removal of ACP for new connects, all of which driving a reversion to mobile-only back to pre-pandemic levels. That broadband market growth rate overall we still saw is significantly reduced for all those factors inside of Q1, but a dramatic drop. That put our performance in relative light given the market overall market backdrop, a lot of which was one-time in nature. In Q2, while it's early because we don't have all the data, I think our evidence shows that for the first time, and due to, again, all of the one-time factors and most dramatically the loss of ACP, the broadband market actually shrunk as a one-time event. If you put our performance and then our statements about relative competition in context with that, I think we're doing pretty well.\nAnd that was the nature of the comments that I provided in the prepared remarks. I do think that, as I mentioned, moves will come back. It's hard to predict exactly when, but moves will come back. Housing starts will return. Apartment rental rates will go back up. And most importantly, the most dramatic effect is once you flush out the ACP impact between Q2 and Q3 predominantly, then you'll be able to get back into a much more normalized environment. And I think the product investments that we're making and the attractiveness of the value that we provide puts us in great position for when that volume returns. And we're doing everything we can in the meantime to preserve all the ACP customers. We're doing really well.\nBut at the same time, making sure that we're ready to come out in a good light on the back end once the volume does pick back up.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nOn the free cash flow side, Jonathan, so I think we had previously talked about working capital for the year coming back to being in a place that was relatively flat. As I said, we're working on the balance sheet and trying to make sure we can extract appropriate cash from the balance sheet to support what we're doing across the business. I think that we'll probably do better than that sort of flat working capital expectation, but I'm not prepared to say by exactly how much. The variability in working capital has a lot to do with exactly how expense timing and capital timing lands over the course of the year.\nAnd so, while I think that we'll get good benefits out of just the balance sheet management side, I'm not going to take up the total thoughts that we've had on working capital today. On your other question, sort of how do we think about, I think it was sort of a one and then the other, do you have to get all the way back to the middle of your range before you accelerate buybacks? I'm in the same place that I was last quarter, which is that I think that we can continue to do buybacks over the course of the rest of the year and still do what we had said that we would do from a leverage perspective. And I don't think of it as, do you have to do one and then the other.\nI'm pretty confident in the trajectory of the business for the second half of the year. So I think that we can have sort of good pacing on buybacks and meet what we've said about leverage at the same time. That being said, the capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We still go after high ROI, organic investment first. We still look then at whether th\nere's a great deal of M&A opportunities next. And those come before sort of this balance sheet management, and share buybacks that happens as the last set of priorities there. So we haven't given a guide around where we think that we'll go in terms of total buybacks.\nIt's because we want to make sure that we maintain that flexibility to do what we think is most important for the business, which is to make the right investments to drive growth of the business going forward.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Chris, I believe you guys took some cost action. I don't know if there were headcount reductions this year at Charter, but I know you guys have had a cost plan you've been working on. I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are doing and how you're approaching that. And I think you had suggested you guys weren't going to touch any sort of customer-facing resources.\nJust give us a sense of where you are on that and your philosophy as you look through the rest of the year and how we might think about that impacting the financials. And then maybe for Jessica, I don't know if you have any visibility at this point into Q3 ACP impact from that 100,000. But if you do, I'd love to hear it. And trying to understand the decline in bad debt. I know you touched on it in your prepared remarks. I don't know if that tells us something about your third quarter ACP expectation or if you still expect cost of service to be flat for the year. We just love a little more color around those trends. Thank you both.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nHey, Ben. There's kind of three parts to that, which is I'll start with the second one you had is the Q3 ACP.\nI'll handle that, and Jessica can comment on bad debt. And then cost reductions, Jessica can go through, and I can tag team there a bit. But from a Q3 ACP outlook, we're not going to be providing any customer net additions guidance today. But for sure, there's going to be, as we both mentioned, I think Jessica and I, that there'll be more non-pay disconnect in the third quarter. But there are a lot of other moving parts, and we're competing well. I think that maybe the interesting tidbit here is maybe talk a little bit more about recent trends. June was oddly the best loss of the second quarter. And internet net adds trends in July have been similar to what we saw in June. Sounds great. But the reality is the ACP-related non-pay disconnect activity hasn't started yet. And we'll know really more about sustainable payment trends.\nThere's nothing to be scared of today, but sustainable payment trends really through August, with the non-pay beginning then and trailing into a little bit into Q4. So when you step back, I know you know this, but ultimately, this ACP transition is a one-time event. And so we're very focused on really isolating the ACP impact internally and evaluating not only, obviously, our performance on retaining those customers because we want to keep them connected. We think it's very valuable, and we can. But also, what's the underlying trend absent the ACP impact to make sure that we're getting better every day? So, Jessica, on ACP, the bad debt piece?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So if you think about what happened in bad debt in the year-over-year, Ben, there's a few things going on.\nOne really was tenure and credit profile in our mobile customer base that's been improving, particularly for customers that have EIP plans with us. On the ACP front, we took a lot of bad debt along the way, particularly for customers who entered the ACP program, and they had outstanding unpaid balances. So those have really been reserved throughout the ACP program. I mentioned it in the remarks, but there also was a portion of the ACP customer base where we have a very low expectation of payment for them. So instead of taking their revenue into revenue and then taking bad debt expenses and offset, we actually didn't recognize revenue for those customers.\nSo when you see that, it means the bad debt expense, I think, absent that, you would have had more bad debt expense if we had put that back in the other direction. And then the last point, I mean, we did have overall lower resi revenue in 2Q and the year-over-year and some mixed changes. And so with other things being equal, that also drives a little bit of downward pressure on bad debt. All of that is to say I wouldn't read anything sort of into what is it that you think about Q3 and looking at what happened with bad debt in the year-over-year. I think there are a number of factors going on there.\nAs you think about then what's happening on the overall cost reduction side, which I think was your other question, the expense management process is pretty extensive. While we're not doing anything that'll impact our sales or service capabilities, we have things that are big, things that are small, some short, some medium, some long-term opportunities all across the business. We've made progress with some vendor cost reductions, with reduced spend around discretionary categories like real estate and third-party services, some reductions to overhead expenses, and implementing some tools to increase our efficiency. And actually, I think the benefits from those came a little faster into 2Q than what we had anticipated. But we're already realizing the benefits of some of the changes. We'll continue to build on additional opportunities over time.\nAs you look at the rest of the year, I think we had given some thoughts on our outlook for expenses. We had expected programming costs per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. I now expect that to be flattish year over year. We previously had said that we expected cost to serve to be flat with 2023. I now expect that to decline by 1% to 2% inclusive of bad debt expense. And in sales to marketing, I think we had said 2% to 3% growth. And at this point, I would expect us to be in the low end of that range, if not a bit below. I also, as an aside, just want to clarify something I said earlier.\nMy comments on working capital. I want to be clear that the comments on working capital are on cable working capital. Mobile continues to have the detriment of the EIP notes. And so those will continue to be a drag, though the securitization plan that we did in the quarter does help that.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nAnd on the cost, if you could just take a different layer of look. So Jessica's right. We're doing lots on vendor savings, overheads, organizational effectiveness in a lower growth environment. All that's true. But just want to make sure everybody understands that the key focus for us in terms of real, permanent, lasting, and accelerating cost reduction is just to be a better service operator. So continuing to invest in our front line, to have better tools, processes, and systems to make the investments that we've made in tenure. And we see that.\nAnd so we are having real results from some of the one-time and permanent cost reductions. But we're also probably having bigger success on reducing the amount of service calls, reducing our truck rolls, increasing the quality of the service that we provide. That's where the money's at. And then when you think about operating leverage, which is a term that you've used before, the best way to have a better operating leverage is to have more customers, to have more products per household, and have higher revenue. And that way, you can together, being a better service operator and having higher penetration of your products, you actually lower your cost to serve per customer. You lower your cost of capital per customer as well, and you become a better cash flow operator. And so all of those things still hold true.\nIt's why when we talk about expense management that we talk about really not doing anything that would impact sales or service because that's the true efficiency opportunity, and that's the opportunity to deliver long-term free cash flow. Our views on that and our front line hasn't changed at all.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Very helpful.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, BofA Securities\n\nQuestion on video, I guess. Can you talk about the take-up of direct-to-consumer in these hybrid linear offers? And you've mentioned a couple that are coming, Paramount+ and Hulu. Is there anything else on the horizon? And then secondly, you mentioned political advertising should pick up in the second half.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nGiven the current political environment, can you give us some color on expectations and if that's increasing?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. On the first one, Jessica, the DTC take-up is going very well. The first one, I know a lot of people think about the Disney deal was in September, but we launched, I think, late in January on Disney Plus Basic, and it's going well, and it's growing every month. We're adding some additional features into it, which will be helpful to even further accelerate the monthly growth that we see. That includes, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the addition of the Disney Plus Premium as an incremental add-on. That'll be coming soon, as well as the Disney Duo Basic bundle of plus $2 for Hulu. And so that allows you to have a comprehensive package the same way that exists inside of retail. And that's helpful.\nIt was always the design. But there's complexity in terms of implementing all of this, also because some of the authentication principles that vary between different operators in terms of credentials and TV Everywhere and whatnot. But it's going well, and it's accelerating. ESPN+, I didn't mention that on the call, is also having very good take-up. It's high value into our RSN packages. It's a small portion of the base, but the penetration is going well. Paramount Plus will launch soon. And ViX, we just launched. And we've always had Max. And so that has existed already within a TV Everywhere authenticated universe. And our expectation is over the next year or so that we'll have a fully baked set of product, which is really what we're working towards. And the more scale we get there, the more effective it's going to be.\nWe're not sitting here saying that we're going to arrest completely the loss of video. But I think what we are saying is to the extent we're going to put video on our broadband bill, it better have value. And if it doesn't have value to the customer, then we'd rather they just go take that through the direct-to-consumer applications. And we need to be proud of what we're putting on the bill. And that's not where the MVPD space has been in a long time. We see a path to being able to be proud of what we're putting on the broadband bill as a video product, that it may be expensive, but it has a significant amount of value. And using that to drive the converged connectivity relationship.\nSo while it may not be growing, it's still really important, and I think it can be very valuable to our converged connectivity relationships. In terms of what's up next, we're not going to go give a programming renewal schedule. But we're optimistic that this has been adopted both from an understanding that the DTCs really do need to be included as part of the full video package. And that's actually better for programmers because of reduced churn and upsell opportunities into the ad-free versions of these products as well. And that, look, at the end of the day, if a customer can go out and get the same product at a cheaper price in the marketplace, I think they should. I don't think we should ask them to pay more through us. And so those are some of the core principles that we've had.\nI'm not getting any, but those are some of the bigger ones. Political advertising, as you know, it's always a jump ball as to exactly where it's going to go. It's evaluated on a state-by-state basis. So you can't really say that it's the same nationally everywhere. It depends on some of the swing states. Admittedly, the events of the past week have jumbled what you thought that might look like. Certainly, when you take a look at fundraising, the volatility, and what could be swing states, it looks like political advertising nationally is going to be higher than what it probably would have been just 10 days ago. But that doesn't mean it happens necessarily in the right states for us. We're keeping an eye on that. It's nice when it happens, but it's one-time in nature.\nAnd so that's why we always try to talk about our results with and without the impacts of political advertising because what is this year's windfall will be next year's headwind. And we want to make sure everybody's focused on the right thing, which is the underlying growth profile of the subscription business. Thank you. Which includes the core advertising, which continues to do well with or without political advertising.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Thanks. And good morning. I have an ACP question that looks beyond Q3. Arguably, ACP has been history's greatest retention program for broadband operators, and you took good advantage of it.\nLooking beyond the wave of involuntary disconnects in Q3 and out to, say, 2025, does that retention benefit go away? I mean, certainly it does. And then what needs to step up in its place? Or should we expect a slightly higher underlying churn rate attributable to those four or five million former ACP subs who go from having essentially no churn to maybe having a normal churn rate?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Well, look, once upon a time, there wasn't an ACP, but it's been a long time. When you think about during the pandemic, we were a big participant in the remote education offer, the Keep Americans Connected, the EBB, which evolved and became the emergency broadband benefit, which evolved and became the ACP. And we've been a significant participant in all of those, as has the industry.\nI think we all have a lot to be proud of for stepping up and really driving those programs. But they didn't exist before. And broadband is a really important product. And from a Charter perspective, we have ways to continue to address that marketplace. Before I go there, you asked about the market-level activity. I do think that in an environment where ACP or an equivalent doesn't exist, that by definition, you have more customers coming in and out of broadband based on affordability. That drives up transaction volume, both from a non-pay disconnect, as well as from a gross adds perspective. When you have better products and better price, that can work towards your advantage. So it's not all bad from our perspective. But we also have the ability to, at acquisition and for retention, offer unique products. Our Internet 100 is attractively priced.\nIt's not for everybody, but it's affordable. And you can pair that together with Spectrum One. So the ability to have a free mobile line for the first year, and then that line rolls to $30 after a year. If you think about a typical one-line environment or even in a typical two-line environment, the average cost of a line is over $60. And so even at retail rate of $30, we've built in a savings of $30 per month through taking mobile together with our attractively priced high-powered broadband product. And that's as much, if not more, than the ACP benefit, which means that if you take our products, we can effectively have the built-in ACP savings available to you when you really take full advantage of our product set.\nAnd so that is a product and a combination that didn't fully exist prior to all of these programs. And I think we can, by having a wider availability for low-income population of these broadband offers, which we have together with our Spectrum One offer combined, I think we can save customers as much, if not more, than they were getting through ACP relative to the past. So I think we're in a good position to be able to address the base. But the market activity, for sure, is going to be higher than what it's been the last couple of years.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, Chris. Thank you very much.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Peter. And that concludes our call. We'll see you next quarter. Thanks, everyone. Thanks, Chris."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, which we encourage you to read carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Stefan. During Q1, we lost 72,000 internet customers. Despite lower internet sales, we added nearly 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.3 million lines year over year. We now have more than 8.2 million total mobile lines, with still low mobile penetration of internet customers and passings. We have a long runway for customer and financial growth, with the nation's fastest mobile service at incredible value. Revenue was relatively flat in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.8%. During Q1, our internet customer growth remained challenged by a low move and generally low activity environment, coupled with continued elevated competition, at least in the short term, and a small impact from fewer low-income connects due to discontinued ACP availability. Churn remains at historically low levels.\nCell phone internet continues to compete for gross additions and has expanded its addressable market within our footprint. We remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our internet product is faster, and it's more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. The cell phone companies will face capacity challenges as customer bandwidth grows. In Q1, wireline overbuild activity continued at a similar pace. Given the value of our converged products, we resisted chasing some less rational promotional offers from overbuilders. As we move forward with our key strategic initiatives, we believe that our differentiated converged connectivity products with superior speeds that save customers money and a video product with increasing value and utility to customers provide us with significant competitive advantages and a platform to grow customers, penetration, EBITDA, and free cash flow over time.\nInternet data usage continues to grow, and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During Q1, internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 800 GB per month. We now offer 300 meg, 500 meg, and 1 gig symmetrical speeds in our first high-split markets. Later this year, we'll begin launching the next wave of markets with distributed access architecture technology. When completed, we'll be capable of offering 5x 1 Gb per second speeds in these markets with even better network performance. The next phase of markets will be upgraded to 10x 1 Gb per second speed and the ability to offer fiber on demand. Ultimately, we'll see lower contact rates and truck rolls across these upgraded markets, achieving both lower cost and a superior product.\nWe expect to complete our network evolution initiative in 2026, all at an incremental cost of just $100 per passing, excluding the benefit of operating and capital savings that result from the project. Our mobile offering also continues to evolve and improve. Earlier this month, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to customers within our Unlimited Plus offering. Anytime Upgrade allows new and existing Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees, and condition requirements. We are the first mobile provider to include this level of freedom within a rate plan. We also recently launched a new repair and replacement plan for just $5 per month. Anytime Upgrade, part of Unlimited Plus, and our repair and replacement plan are each profitable.\nSpectrum One, continues to perform well beyond its first anniversary and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like mobile speed boost, and seamless connectivity to the Spectrum Mobile network across Android and iOS devices. We still have a lot of room to grow our mobile business. Today, less than 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. We remain underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market-leading pricing at promotion and retail. From a dollars perspective, we capture less than 30%, share of residential mobile and internet dollars spent in our footprint today. Mobile will be a meaningful driver of EBITDA and cash flow going forward, with what is still an untapped ability to drive overall customer relationship growth.\nFinally, turning to the evolution of our video product, we now offer a unique modern user experience with Xumo, which offers both linear and direct-to-consumer content on one device, combined with packaging and pricing options that offer choice, value, and utility across FAST, SVOD, direct-to-consumer apps, and linear video services. In January, Disney Plus became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost, with ESPN Plus launched to Select Plus customers in March. ViX, a Spanish-language DTC product, and regional sports DTC products will also be available to customers at no extra cost within their respective packages. We expect our hybrid DTC linear model to be fully deployed next year, and we'll be able to deliver value for our customers and programming partners through fully bundled hybrid services, genre-based packages, selling DTC à la carte, and potentially bundled DTC services to our broadband customers.\nIn late January, we launched our Spectrum TV Stream package, a 90-channel non-sports general entertainment package priced at $40 per month. TV Stream provides a compelling content offering at an attractive price from programmers like Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, Fox, AMC, and A&E. And so while the video business is clearly under pressure, we believe that flexible and attractively priced packaging options across all forms of video channels, really, integrated within a modern user interface in a more frictionless environment, can recreate value in the ecosystem for our customers, programmers, and distributors. So when we step back, we clearly recognize some short-term market challenges, and we've embraced the opportunity to become an even better operator, leaving no stone unturned in our go-to-market and our efficiency initiatives. And in the meantime, we're growing a unique converged product at a rapid pace, we can grow EBITDA through a competitive investment cycle.\nLong-term, our network and customer demand, products, pricing, and packaging capabilities, our service infrastructure, and the associated investments we're making today position Charter for sustainable growth and value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide five. Including residential and SMB, we lost 72,000 internet customers in the first quarter, and video customers declined by 405,000. In mobile, we added 486,000 mobile lines, and wireline voice customers declined by 279,000. Our mobile product continued to perform well. And although we saw lower mobile gross adds year over year tied to lower gross internet additions, we also saw lower overall mobile churn rates year over year and sequentially. Customers who signed up for our Spectrum One product in the first quarter of 2023 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Similar to last quarter, those promotional rollouts did not drive incremental internet churn. In fact, our internet churn rate also declined year over year. So as we always expected, Spectrum One lines are performing well, and our converged offering drives higher mobile sales and longer customer lifetimes.\nTurning to rural, we ended the quarter with 493,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 324,000 over the last 12 months and 73,000 in the first quarter. It's a bit of a slowdown from Q4, as we noted it would be on our last call, given winter construction seasonality. Penetration growth continues to exceed our expectations, and customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint increased with 35,000 net customer additions in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024, about 50%, more than in 2023. We also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. The RDOF and ARPA program rules have been successful in driving large-scale private capital builds. With respect to BEAD, most of the state's rules are still working through the NTIA review process.\nWe expect some states will have a regulatory environment conducive to private investment, while others will not. We'll be disciplined in our investment approach with the continued expectation that some opportunities with appropriate ROIs will be available. Before turning to our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program. An ACP renewal now appears unlikely for the program's 23 million recipients nationwide and for our 5.0 million internet customers receiving a subsidy. We will do everything we can to preserve our relationship with the ACP subsidy recipients, and we expect to keep the vast majority of them as customers. We have a number of ways to assist those that may lose their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program and Internet 100 product. We're also offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for one year.\nThe success of our Spectrum One offering has shown that we can create long-term converged connectivity customers by saving consumers hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their mobile bill. Even after the initial promotional period ends, we will still be able to save these customers the equivalent or more than the $30 ACP subsidy benefit that they are currently receiving. The majority of ACP recipients in our customer base were internet customers before the start of the ACP program. The vast majority of our ACP customers also pay something out of pocket for their internet service. Ultimately, we will lose some customers, and our internet RPU and bad debt expense may have one-time pressure. We expect the impact to Charter to be mostly limited to the Q2 and Q3 of this year. We will provide transparency for those impacts in our quarterly reporting.\nMoving to Q1 financial results, starting on slide six. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.7%, driven by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined 0.1% over year, given a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, mostly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile. As slide six shows, in total, residential revenue, declined by 0.4% year over year. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue, declined by 0.3% year over year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue, per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were slightly offset by SMB customer growth, of 0.2% year over year. Enterprise revenue, grew 3.8% year over year, driven by enterprise PSU growth, of 6.9% year over year.\nExcluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue, grew by 5.5%. First-quarter advertising revenue, grew by 10% year over year, given political revenue growth, and core ad revenue was essentially flat year over year. Other revenue, grew by 2.4% year over year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated first-quarter revenue, was up 0.2% year over year and down 0.1% year over year when excluding advertising. Moving to operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA, on slide seven, in the first quarter, total operating expenses, declined by 1.5% year over year. Programming costs, declined by 8.2% year over year due to the decline in video customers of 8% year over year, and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates.\nQ1 2024 programming costs, include around $30 million, of favorable adjustments, versus $50 million, of favorable adjustments in the prior year period. Other costs of revenue, increased by 9.8%, primarily driven by mobile service direct costs, and higher mobile device sales. Cost-to-service customers, were essentially flat year over year, with additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile, and higher bad debt expense, mostly offset by lower service transactions per customer, including productivity from tenure investments. Sales and marketing costs, declined by 2.7%, primarily driven by lower labor costs, partly tied to lower connect volumes. Finally, other expense, grew by 0.5%. Adjusted EBITDA, grew by 2.8% year over year in the quarter. When excluding advertising, EBITDA, grew by 2.2% year over year.\nLooking ahead, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can do that even as we make significant investments in the business, face a challenging competitive environment, and reach the likely end of the ACP program. Our residential revenue, will be supported by internet RPU growth and our growing mobile customer base. In addition, mobile's contribution to EBITDA, continues to improve as the business scales. We've also lapped the significant investments that we made in our employee base, so the related EBITDA, drag should be mostly behind us. Finally, we continue to carefully manage our expenses across the business. While we're not going to do anything that would impact our sales or service capabilities, this quarter's cost-to-service customers and sales and marketing expense, results demonstrate our ability to drive efficiencies into the business.\nIn the second quarter, we will face some tough expense comparisons, particularly in other expense, as well as ACP headwinds. While our second quarter EBITDA growth, will be muted, our expense management process is clearly working. Financial growth in the back half of the year should accelerate, given our expense management initiative, Spectrum One promotional rolloff, and political advertising revenue. Turning to net income, on slide eight, we generated $1.1 billion, of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, up from $1 billion, last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, and a gain on the sale of towers, partly offset by higher income tax and interest expenses. Turning to slide nine, capital expenditures, totaled $2.8 billion, in the first quarter, about $325 million, above last year's first-quarter spend.\nLine extensions, totaled $1 billion, $69 million, higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential, commercial, greenfield, and market selling opportunities. First-quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $1.6 billion, in the first quarter of 2023, driven by higher spend on upgrade rebuild, primarily network evolution, and higher CPE spend, due to purchases of Zumo stream boxes. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect capital expenditures, to total between $12.2 and $12.4 billion, including line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. Turning to free cash flow, on slide 10, free cash flow, in the first quarter totaled $358 million, a decrease of approximately $300 million compared to last year.\nThe decline was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures and a one-time settlement payment in Q1 2024, partly offset by a less unfavorable change in working capital year over year, and higher adjusted EBITDA. We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 85%, fixed-rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $140 million. As of the end of Q1, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA, was 4.41x, which is lower sequentially and year over year.\nWe expect to continue that trend, moving closer to the middle of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year. We remain fully committed to maintaining our split-rated debt structure, including access to the investment-grade market, given the significant benefits it offers to all of our providers of capital. And we continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We believe that our levered equity strategy, including share buybacks, combined with the investments that we are making in the business, will drive value going forward. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million, Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $567 million, at an average price of $339 per share. With the continued temporary impact from cell phone internet competition, and the potential headwind from the end of ACP, we will continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds.\nDespite these short-term challenges, we are competing well. We have a very attractively structured balance sheet, and we're focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth, in 2024 through a short-term competitive and investment cycle. We're well positioned today and for continued future growth. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nHi, Sophie, are you there?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star five on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star five. Again, that is star five to ask a question. We'll pause a moment to allow for questions to queue. Thank you. Our first question will come from John Hodulick, from UBS. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\n\nJohn Hodulick\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. If I could follow up on the ACP comments, first of all, just any additional color you guys can provide on the subscriber and RPU impacts to that program winding down in the second and third quarter. And it sounds like, given the cost-cutting opportunities and the commentary, you still believe you can grow EBITDA for the year. That's number one. And then number two, I thought the commentary about the churn on the video side from the Disney renewal was interesting. Chris, is that a trend that you expect to continue, especially as you sort of roll over your existing or you go through more renewals, and add more D2C services to your lineup? Thanks.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. Let me try to tackle those. And Jessica may want to chime in here as well. The first one is on ACP and what we estimate. John, the non-renewal of ACP, there's 23 million customers, having today. It's unfortunate, but it's certainly going to have a negative internet customer growth impact for everyone, including us. And that's going to happen, what's already a seasonal Q2, and probably Q3 as we work through likely non-pay activity. And so really, as you think about the extent of those losses, it's going to depend on a few things. One, first being the stickiness of our retention offers. That includes us doing a free mobile line as well as for all ACP customers. That allows customers to save as much, if not more money on a monthly basis than the subsidy we already offered by ACP.\nIn some cases, it can be much closer to EBB or maybe even more. We do have Spectrum Internet Assist. We have Internet 100. So we have products that we can move people to as needed. The second thing I would say is it's going to depend on how well we really execute on those retention tactics. That matters, and then thirdly, the way that we manage what's going to be likely an elevated non-pay environment and really managing that to the best of our ability, for the benefit of customers. In terms of specifics, this event is unprecedented. In almost 30 years of cable, I haven't seen something like this before. The short-term impact, it's difficult to predict. But in the end, I'm really confident we're going to manage through it successfully.\nIt'll be a one-time event, both on subscribers and maybe an initial suppression of RPU, but it's not going to impact our long-term growth potential.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. And as you think about EBITDA, across the year, we pointed out, and I would just highlight it, there are some pressures on EBITDA in Q2, because of the comps to last year, as well as likely if there is non-pay impact, there could be some bad debt pressure inside of Q2 as well. So I would expect our EBITDA growth, to be more pressured in Q2, but we see the ability for it to accelerate across the rest of the year when you consider the roll-off of Spectrum Mobile, political advertising, and our continued expense initiatives in the business as well. And so because of that, in all of the scenarios that we've looked at, we continue to expect EBITDA growth in the year.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. And so EBITDA, we're very confident on that. Giving a hard estimate on subscriber impact for all the reasons I mentioned is difficult, but we're going to outline that quarter by quarter. We'll have the ability to isolate. We'll provide that transparency for people to log so they can see what's the underlying growth rate. Your other question, John, I want to make sure I understand, was on video churn. We rolled out at the beginning of the quarter, we rolled out the Disney Plus to all Spectrum Select customers and above and to Select Plus customers, which is our more sports-oriented package on top. We rolled out ESPN Plus in March. Very early on, good take-up on that product along the way, but there was nothing that was a rotation of our subscriber base inside there. So there was not a negative contributing factor to adding those in.\nI would highlight in an environment where video these days really is coming in as an attach rate to internet, when you have lower internet sales opportunities, that has an impact on video. So the video churn rate stays relatively consistent, but the combination of having both lower selling opportunities for internet and therefore lower attach rates for video, combined with the fact that we did do a programming cost increase pass-through inside of Q1, contributed to the video loss inside the quarter.\nI do think that as we add more bundling of these DTCs in a hybrid linear model over time, I think we have the ability to stem a lot of the churn and actually add back to both the gross addition side coming from potentially new calls coming in, but also a higher attach rate to internet, primarily as we provide more value into the package, which offsets the significant programming cost increases that we've been forced to pass through. Does that answer where you were trying to get to?\n\nJohn Hodulick\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, that's perfect. Thanks, Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood. Okay. Thanks.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nOperator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne, with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just maybe unpacking the EBITDA outlook a little bit more. Jessica, last quarter, you gave us some helpful guidance on a few expense line items for the year. I think programming, cost to service, and marketing come to mind. I don't know if you had any updates on any of those given some of the moving pieces. Just wanted to check on that. And then secondly, for either of you or both of you, just on broadband competition, could you spend a minute just talking about sort of how you see your products competing right now with fixed wireless, which is sort of everywhere or in a lot of markets, and then the wireline overbuild piece?\nBecause fixed wireless net adds at the industry level this quarter, or cell phone internet, to stay on brand here, were down year on year and a bit lighter than at least we were expecting. So it does seem like that product is starting to mature here, but you also called out wireline overbuild sort of pricing discounts in the market as well. So I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on sort of the competitive framework you're thinking about this year. Thanks.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nSo, Ben, on the line item expense guidance that we gave earlier in the year, I don't have an update to any of those specific items, but what I would tell you is that because of some of the work that we're doing around expenses across the business, I think it's possible that we come in lower than what we guided to begin with. I don't have a revision, but I think it's possible we come in on the low side.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Even with the bad debt comment you made earlier.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nSo that's a fair call out. The exact amount of the bad debt related to ACP is hard to predict because it's a matter of what the mix is between customers that go non-pay and customers that sort of contact you in some other way. So that's a fair call out. On items other than that, I think the possibility is that we do better.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nAbsolutely. You've got a lower transaction environment plus all the expense management activity that we're doing, and that'll have significant impact to cost to serve as well as sales and marketing as well.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nBen, the broadband competition, maybe just take a step back and talk a little bit more in detail about the operating environment, competitive, and the results in that context. The first thing I think is important just to keep in mind is our churn. It continues to be at or below historic lows. So very good. Bear with me, but we actually performed a little better in Q1 in competitive switching versus last year, which then somebody said, \"Well, wait a second. How's that work?\" And the real issue has been selling opportunities for broadband were actually much lower in the marketplace year over year. And that's driven by continued lower year-over-year move and household formation rates. There is some reversion to pre-pandemic mobile-only levels the past two quarters.\nAt the same time, as you mentioned, there's still some cell phone internet expansion, and that's competing, which is for a much lower opportunity set. So if you add to that just a bit of impact from the removal of ACP connects that started in early February, that's really what drove us to the loss of roughly 70,000 internet. Ben, as you know, in this environment, small shifts in gross adds, in particular, or even churn, which hasn't been the case, it just really has an outsized impact on net adds. So that's going to definitely, as I mentioned before, it's going to be the case in the seasonal Q2, also with the end of ACP, all of which is temporary in nature. I think the bigger question is, what are we doing?\nAnd as I mentioned, we still know, and I think everybody agrees, we have the best products, and we have it at the best all-in price, particularly when you're combining broadband and mobile, which is in a lot of cases what we're competing against. Our network evolution to symmetrical and multi-gig wireline and wireless capabilities, and we're doing that at a low cost of $100 per passing. And then, as I mentioned, we have the expansion of that best-in-class network and converged products to homes with no broadband today. So in essence, what we're doing is we're still very competitive, saving customers lots of money with fastest products, and we do that with a 100% in-house onshore service structure.\nWhen you put that together with what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is continued increasing customer demand for data, it means we're very well positioned to return to sustainable growth over time. The key for us really is, in the meantime, we're heads down on execution. It doesn't mean that we don't have short-term opportunities. We're leaving no stone unturned on go-to-market. We have great assets and ability to package and price in, I think, ways that are new and innovative. What we're trying to do in the meantime as well, you mentioned on wireline overbuild in particular, still be very disciplined around the pricing because we know the value of our products.\nWe saw a few overbuilders go a little bit downstream during the quarter, and we've resisted the temptation to go there just because we know the value of our both wireline and wireless services and the value that we can bring to customers long-term.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you both.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYep.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin, at New Street. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research LLP\n\nThanks. I guess a first one for Jessica, just on the change in your leverage target navigating towards the midpoint of the range. Would love to just get some more context on the thinking behind that. You sort of mentioned earlier in the script that the risk of higher rates isn't a material concern. And so does navigating down in the leverage range just reflect lower confidence in the cash generation in the business given the competitive environment?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So Jonathan, I would say our confidence in the business hasn't changed. We remain comfortable with our 4 to 4.5x range, based on the outlook that we have. But I think being sort of at the height of the investment cycle, we thought that creating a little bit of headroom was appropriate. We constantly reevaluate our position. We'll continue to do that, but we continue to believe in the long-term trajectory of the business. We think the investments that we're making will deliver strong returns, and we know that maintaining the levered equity strategy, including sort of buybacks and leverage levels overall, is important to continuing to drive value.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nI would just add on to that. Just to add, Jessica said it, but zero lack of confidence. We have good, strong free cash flow today, have even growing free cash flow, and much more so as we get through these one-time investments. It's really, as Jessica's already said, it's about making sure that we ensure the investment grade structure we have. That's important to us. It's important to our debt holders, and it's important to our equity holders as well.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research LLP\n\nChris, just to follow up on that, were the rating agencies sort of asking you to bring leverage lower in the range? Are there things that we could look for in the business that would make you feel comfortable to go back to the high end of the range over the course of the next few quarters?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nJonathan, we're in regular contact with all three of the ratings agencies. Certainly, I think that there has been some additional conversation across debt holders and the rating agencies, given the higher CapEx that we have in the business and the sort of short-term pressure that that puts on free cash flow. Given sort of the tone of the broader market, you might have seen S&P issue, the cheat sheet at the end of last week, that addressed ACP and the competitive environment. I think their concerns are similar to those of equity holders, though they noted in there that they don't expect our ratings to change, even though they might adjust their triggers somewhat. Even if our corporate family ratings were to change, they didn't expect any impact to the investment grade rating. We constantly communicate with them.\nI think that given where we are, it made sense for us to create a little bit of headroom. As I said, we constantly reevaluate. It's certainly possible that we could move back up in the range at some point in time, particularly as you think about sort of free cash flow growth coming back as the investments wind down.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. And so being responsive and, at the same time, given the current stock price, we want to do as much as we can within that responsiveness.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research LLP\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nOperator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett, at MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC\n\nHi. Thank you. Chris, I want to maybe two questions. One broader, sort of more strategic question, and then just one clarification from Jessica. On the first one, Chris, you said something to me a while back that I've been thinking about, about the way you think about convergence, and you characterized the Spectrum One offer not really as an offer, but sort of as a new product category. I wonder if you could just talk about that a little bit, and particularly in the context of AT&T talking quite frequently about their converged offering in the portion of their footprint where they have it. T-Mobile now with their Lumos deal yesterday, obviously sort of searching around for a converged offering. How much of the market is actually going in that direction? And then, Jessica, just one minor clarification.\nCould you just let us know how much is left of wholesale in the business services market, so that we can understand when we might start to see the overall growth rate start to look more like the non-wholesale part of your business?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSo Craig, I'll start on the first one on convergence. I think the best way to do this, and I spend a lot of time internally talking about it as well, is if I asked you 15 years ago, what's the speed of your internet connection? You would have connected to the back of the computer in your kitchen, and that would have been it. And 10 years ago, it might have been, here it is on Wi-Fi on my couch or out on the terrace. And today, if you're pulling out of the driveway and driving out, and I say, \"Who's your internet provider right now?\" you'd say, \"I don't know. I don't care.\nIt just has to work, and it has to be fast.\" And if that's people's definition increasingly of what's broadband connectivity, then we're the only provider in our footprint that can provide that uniform, ubiquitous broadband internet in a seamless connectivity way. And so we have the internet. We have the Wi-Fi. Our 5G cellular is a backup service when internet and Wi-Fi isn't available. And last we reported, it was 87%, of our traffic was going over our Wi-Fi, and increasingly with CVRS. So 5G, interestingly, it's the backup radio. It's the slowest portion of our network. And when you put that all together in a way that I think we're uniquely capable of doing, we have the ability to offer something in the marketplace. Now, the challenge is that's not the way that it's been sold.\nIt's not the way that customers think about it explicitly today in terms of how they purchase service. So there's an education challenge that's there in the way that we package, price, and market that along the way. We'll have a meaningful impact. Another way of thinking about it is that mobile today, and in fact, I would argue always has been, is just an extension of an internet connection. Is it really a product? Is mobile a product, or is it just an extension? Because even 15 years ago, there's really a wireline service going to a tower, and it was just extending the broadband connection. Today, we're doing that from Wi-Fi inside the home, out on strand. We have the ability to provide that service in a ubiquitous way that is competitive.\nSpectrum One, the idea is how do you educate the market and try to get the purchase habits to change in a different way? And over time, is mobile really a product? And testing and pushing the limits in the market, I think we have something here that's a competitive advantage, and it just may take a little bit of time to fully flush its way out. But we are that service provider today, not only to ourselves, but we're actually providing that backhaul service to foreign cellular devices on our Wi-Fi routers today. And we are the backhaul and the backbone of almost all cellular traffic. So it just puts a unique opportunity for us to capitalize on that in the future.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nCraig on the other side, wholesale is a little less than 20%, of overall enterprise revenues.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThe piece of that, the piece that's pulling that is really cell tower backhaul. The actual traditional wholesale.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So that's really a little less than half of that piece.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nRight. So the traditional wholesale is relatively steady, and it's the cell tower backhaul that's in systemic decline, if you will.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Craig. Sophie, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Croft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Croft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning. If I could, first, Jessica, related to free cash flow, I was wondering if you could size for us the one-time payment in the first quarter that impacted free cash flow, and also if you could help us understand how you're thinking about working capital usage this year. And then, Chris, just on network neutrality, I was wondering if you would share your thoughts on the FCC's recent reinstituting of net neutrality rules. Any concerns with the rules? Do they impact the way you're running the business in any way, whether it's on the home broadband or on the mobile side? Thanks.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So Brian, the one-time payment that impacted free cash flow, on the order of $150 to $180 million, in that range. And then from a working capital perspective, Q1 is always, for us, a negative working capital quarter. And I fully expect that we'll sort of make back to close to flat over the course of the year, the negative working capital that we had, working capital excluding the mobile device or the mobile side in the first quarter. Obviously, mobile continues to be a drag on working capital because of the device sales. And so you should expect that piece to continue.\nBrian, on the net neutrality, I would start from the get-go. The key concern isn't net neutrality. The concern is the Title II regime. We don't block. We don't do paid prioritization. We don't throttle. And we don't even have data caps. We believe that customers should have unlimited usage of the service that they're paying for. The question has really been around Title II and what that brings, things around forbearance on rate regulation, the additional unintended consequences of where that can lead to on regulation for a product that, without regulation, that type of regulation has been very successful to delivering tremendous value for consumers over a couple of decades now. I would say that where we're at in the Title II debate with the FCC, there's zero surprise. It's exactly where everybody thought we would be. And we're going to continue to go through that process.\nUnfortunately, it seems like over many years, as this kind of works its way, probably back through a court at this stage. And then hopefully, over time, we can get a standard set by Congress that puts this to bed once and for all. That's always been the hope. But I don't think Title II, is the right way to regulate the things that we're already doing well.\n\nBrian Croft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, you both. Appreciate it.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks. Thanks. Sophie, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rowlands, at Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Rowlands\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks, and good morning. Two questions. First, with respect to the residential broadband RQ performance, can you unpack the benefit in the quarter from the Spectrum One promotions rolling off and how the potential benefit of this in terms of size can move through the year as more customers start getting back to maybe the normal course rate levels? And then just secondly, in the press release for quite some time now, you've footnoted customers, and I hope I'm framing this right, that are broadband subscribers where there may have been some suspension of collections for other Charter services. And I'm curious what happens to those customers if ACP is discontinued. And do those disclosures provide any insight on how to quantify potential customer risk or churn risk if this program is discontinued? Thanks.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So starting on the first one, on the internet RPU, the Spectrum One allocation was 70 basis points, of drag year over year on internet RPU growth, in the quarter. So the GAAP internet RPU, increased by 1.7%. It would have been 2.4%, excluding the mobile allocation for free lines. Generally, I would expect that the gap in those two growth rates should narrow over the course of the year because the base of free lines becomes more stable given promotional rolloff. However, I talked about that we are offering all of our ACP, customers a free mobile line for a year. And depending on the level of success of that program, if we did see a re-acceleration in the number of free lines, the gap between those two things could widen again.\nTalking about what you see inside of the footnote and the aging, so we have had a process over time where we save customers into ACP. So if there was a customer who took multiple lines of business, say they were an internet and video customer, and they were paying us and then went into a non-pay status, but they were eligible for ACP.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nOr initiate in most cases.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nOr already in ACP, what we would do would be to downgrade the customer to an internet-only product that was fully covered by the ACP subsidy, which enabled them to continue their internet service. But then they would no longer have whatever the additional services were that were on their account. We have held those balances, though they're fully reserved. So they're sitting in receivables, but they're also sort of fully written off already in the bad debt reserve process. But you are correct that numerically inside of the footnote, then you can see the base of customers who at some point in the past went into a non-pay process but have had their bill fully subsidized by ACP for some period of time.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. And if you think about it just from a customer perspective and how we were trying to be responsive to the government request, we wanted to make sure that these customers entering into a collection cycle on video or phone didn't somehow suppress their ability to continue to receive the ACP benefit and continue to receive connectivity. And that's a classic example of a base of customers that we're going to work through, as I talked about, from a collection cycle, and do the right thing for those customers to do everything we can to make sure that they stay connected to internet over time. But there's challenges there.\n\nMichael Rowlands\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAre you choosing to implement the ACP wind down at the end of April, or are you planning to go through mid-May with your customers?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nWe'll go through the month of May with a partial ACP in accordance with what the government outlined. It's going to be a partial credit of $14, and we've agreed to make it $15, just around it and make it clear to customers. So that's what we'll do inside of May.\n\nMichael Rowlands\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. Sophie, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vijay Jayant, with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nVijay Jayant\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore\n\nThanks. Chris, given your focus on improving the video consumer proposition, I think you have a pretty substantial programming contract coming up very shortly. And I know you sort of went with the Disney agreement. Is there a big opportunity to sort of resize your programming costs associated with that sort of portfolio of channels? And second, I saw that your buyback authorization is somewhere around the $260 million. Is that something that's going to be re-upped? Thanks.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications",
    "content2": "So on the first question, the connection was a little off. So we're going to sell you Spectrum Mobile after this call here. So I'm going to take the liberty of answering the question I think you asked. Look, we don't get into detail on individual programming renewals. We've been generally very successful at getting renewals throughout the years. That's always our goal. Our goal, though, is to really make sure that, first and foremost, that we really change the model so that we once again create value for customers. That starts with not asking them to pay twice for the same product, which is the debate that we've had historically and where we set a new model. It also means approaching the marketplace and all of our deal renewals and saying, \"Look, we got to fight for the customer.\nAnd if they have a path to get a product that's equivalent or, in some cases, even better for a lower price, then we should just be selling that product.\" That's the way that we should go to market. We can have that ability to do traditional linear hybrid. We can sell DTCs. We can sell them in a bundle. We have 25,000 in-house sales representatives in sales and retention. So we have a workforce that's very capable of being a distribution engine for linear hybrid DTC. We have a large base of broadband customers, our passings, that we can use that's unique. We want to do that in a way that creates value for consumers. I think as we've approached the marketplace in what is a different way, it creates consternation because it's something very different.\nBut our goal here is really to create a video ecosystem that works for customers in providing utility and value again, utility through Zoom and value through our ability to package in different ways that meets the customer's needs at a fair price. And ultimately, while it may be painful along the way, actually it creates value again for programmers and distributors and recreates a video ecosystem that works for everybody. And so we're not approaching this from a way of just trying to save money. We're just trying to actually create value for customers by either adding more product so that the price they pay is worth it or saving them money because they wanted to package anyway. And we can do that in a way that in a lower churn environment for the benefit of programmers. And that just takes a little bit to get through.\nBut our goals here are really to recreate a video ecosystem that works for everybody. Today, it doesn't. It's been broken, and it's been broken for a while. And I think that we have, for the first time in maybe two decades, where we can do something where we have a product that we're proud to put on our internet bill at some point soon. And that really is, when we talked about it last year, the balance of, on one hand, our bundled customers churn less. And so a high-quality video product has always been an asset. But when the rate continues to go up, the value goes down, and it's being sold around customers and asking them to pay twice, then it becomes a liability on the internet broadband bill.\nAnd then I think we need to rethink the way that what we're selling for video and how it actually creates value for customers or not. So that's where we've been. And I'm confident we're going to continue to make progress in this space.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nOh, on the buyback authorization side, I want to make sure we answer that question. The authorization as of the end of the quarter, as you pointed out, is a little bit lower than what you would typically see. There are multiple mechanisms by which that gets renewed, and we have increased the buyback authorization since that point in time. Just because of the read-through to that, I want to be really clear that we expect to be able to maintain our buybacks over the course of the year, even as we delever. You should not read that through as any sort of sign about the direction of the program.\n\nVijay Jayant\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Vijay. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question will come from Steven Cahill, with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Cahill\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. So Chris, earlier you said you're confident in returning to long-term growth, and you spoke a lot about the overbuilding activity that you're seeing. I think the challenge many of us have is when we pencil that out and kind of think about penetration of fiber, and then we look at your passings growth and think about penetration as well. It's just tough to see when things return to growth on the subscriber side, maybe ex-rural. So I was wondering if you could just give us any thinking as to your color and timing when we might start to see subscriber growth re-accelerate to a positive level. And then, Jessica, just picking up on Brian's question, you talked about maybe mobile being a bit of a drag in working capital this year.\nAs you start to do the ACP lines for mobile, could that accelerate the drag from mobile working capital on handsets or do you not expect those customers to necessarily be acquiring new handsets? Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSo I'm not going to provide a detailed timeline for the timing to re-accelerate just because I want to be conservative and recognize that it's a very fluid space. I mean, clearly, we have ACP going on right now, which is going to be a one-time hit. You have cell phone internet where they will reach capacity, and the timing of that isn't entirely clear. And then there's fiber upgrades, which had been announced and are pretty far along from what was actually announced. So I think if you put that all together, though, and flip it and say, \"Well, get past ACP,\" and the pace of fiber upgrades is relatively stable, and I think over time should actually start to decline. Cell phone internet will run out of capacity, and you're already starting to see some signs of some of that paring back, all of which bodes well.\nThen you combine that with the fact that when you look at the quality of our internet product in 100% of the market, particularly, and even more so in those that don't have a gig overlap, which is about half. Then you combine that with the unique ability to provide a very attractively priced mobile product that's actually the fastest mobile product in the business simply because it largely rides on our gigabit wireless infrastructure. We have a structural advantage for now and many years to come, not only just on quality, but the ability to save customers hundreds and even thousands of dollars. So I sit back and look at that and say, \"It isn't a question of if. It's just a question of when.\" As some of these short-term pressures pare back, that's when you'll start to see it turn.\nHonestly, we haven't been the best at predicting the exact timing of that. So I said last quarter we owned that. So I want to be careful that I'm not overextending ourselves here either. But I think it's more important just to take a step back and look at what is the product we have? What's the network capabilities we have? It's only getting better. If you then tack on to that the rural passings that you mentioned, ex-rural. So I did that ex-rural. But if you add on to that the subsidized rural passings where it's just math in terms of the penetration, the net additions that we're going to get on the back of that investment, I still think the future is very, very bright for Charter.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nOn the mobile working capital side, so you point out, without a doubt, the drag on working capital is driven by the number of phones or other mobile devices that you sell subject to EIP notes. And so if we were to end up with additional devices because of having additional mobile customers as a result of our work on ACP, or if we end up with some additional devices because of the anytime upgrade program, which is also possible, there could be some acceleration in that drag. What I would tell you on the other side of that is, as we've been building our mobile business, we haven't taken advantage of some of the financing options that are available for us related to having those EIP notes as part of our overall asset stack.\nIt hadn't yet made sense for a wide variety of reasons, including just sort of building the scale for a program like that to make sense. I think it's also possible that we could offset some of that drag in working capital by working through some of those financing mechanisms. Certainly, as we've been building, I think we're reaching a size at which that becomes a more viable option.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. And look forward to talking to you again on the next one.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Operator."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Aninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, which we encourage you to read carefully. Various remarks that we make on today's call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks Stefan. In 2023 we added 155,000 Internet customers, and we added nearly two and a half million Spectrum Mobile lines for growth of nearly 50%. At the end of 2023 we had more than 7.7 million total mobile lines. Only 13% of our Internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years as the quality and value of our converged connectivity services gains wider recognition. Revenue was up by 1% in 2023 while EBITDA grew by 1.3% and 2.5% when excluding advertising. While we're executing well on our long term strategic initiatives and Spectrum One is working to drive mobile growth, Internet growth in our existing footprint has been challenging, driven by admittedly more persistent competition from fixed wireless and similar levels of wireline overbuilt activity.\nSmall changes in gross additions and churn in a low transaction environment have driven outsized impacts to net gains, which was clearly the case as we moved through the last quarter. I own that, so let me start with what we believe on the competitive environment and then what we're doing to drive long-term growth by delivering high-quality products and service at a great price. Fixed Wireless Access, while an inferior product with limited capacity in geographic coverage, which is fluid, is often marketed by the phone companies at a perceived lower price to their existing customers. We continue to believe the impact from Fixed Wireless Access is temporary. Our internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile.\nCustomer bandwidth needs continue to increase, and MNOs will face capacity challenges and will be required to allocate their spectrum and capital to maintain profitable mobile services. While we can't promise when that happens, I believe bandwidth needs increase and quality and value win on the wireline overbuild front, we continue to compete well. Overbuild impact tends to be limited to a few percentage points of internet penetration during the first year of a new overbuild vintage coming online. It's painful, but it's tied to the pace of overbuild. We don't see overbuilders reaching their penetration and ROI goals now within our footprint now or in the future. They don't have the same ubiquitous convergence capabilities as we do. Their lower cost passings have likely been built.\nSome of the planned overbuild was duplicative between operators, meaning less opportunity, and incremental financing costs have increased, putting even more pressure on overbuilder returns. We also expect bid passings will provide better capital allocation and ROI for many of these operators. Our assumption is that our competitors are rational economic players with shareholders and balance sheets which require adequate return on investment that isn't within our control. So we are focused on the key strategic initiatives that enhance our long term competitiveness growth capabilities, and we expect to return to a more normalized Internet growth over time. Just over a year from when we detailed those initiatives, I wanted to remind everyone of their rationale and update you on their status. As laid out on Slide 4, our footprint expansion is beating our pacing, penetration, ARPU, and ROI targets.\nNew construction will help drive internet customer growth despite the temporary challenges I mentioned. Within our existing footprint, 2023 subsidized rural customer growth was already over 100,000. Our penetration also continues to grow at a better than expected pace and will activate more subsidized rural passings this year, both of which Jessica will cover. BEAD will provide additional opportunities, although the potential is uncertain given our concerns regarding how states will apply NTIA guidelines; we'll focus BEAD investments in states where the rules are conducive to private investment outside of rural. We also have accelerated greenfield market fill in and serviceability builds, expanding our existing footprint in both residential and commercial passings. Penetration curves and returns here are similarly strong and predictable with a lower build cost.\nWe also remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience via our execution initiative, which is intended to enhance frontline employees' tenure while simultaneously investing in digitization, all to drive better sales yields, higher quality transactions, lower overall service transactions, and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our targeted investments in employees over the last two years resulted in a significant reduction in employee attrition in 2023. Our investments in the digitization of service is also driving efficiencies in 2024. We have a number of new automated platforms that are launching to facilitate better service for customers and better digital and AI tools for agents to enhance service quality and the quality of their day-to-day jobs. And finally, our Evolution initiative which includes our Network Evolution project, convergence efforts, and our video product development all remain on course.\nWe fully launched symmetrical speed tiers in two markets and currently launching in six more, completing our Step One markets. We'll also begin to work in our Step Two markets with DAA later this year. Excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our Network Evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. We expect to complete the project in 2026, so a fast, ubiquitous, low-cost upgrade of our capabilities which our competitors can't replicate. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and grow. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and the Spectrum Mobile Network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotion and at retail. Spectrum One customers reaching their first anniversary are performing ahead of our expectations.\nWe'll continue to evolve our converged offering in 2024 with additional features and capabilities.\nFinally turning to the evolution of our video product, in October we launched the Xumo Platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct to consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the U.S., Xumo is our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're approaching 1 million deployed Xumo boxes since launch and we've been getting great customer feedback and we can keep improving our attach rates. In early January, Disney became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost and in the next several months ESPN and ViX, a Spanish-language DTC product, will both become available to certain TV Select customers at no extra cost.\nThis new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers, and we plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal. That means packaging, flexibility, value, and not asking customers or Charter to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. Our new hybrid distribution model combined with Xumo's Content Forward interface provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value, and utility with seamless linear, DTC, and SVOD integration and advanced search and discovery functionality.\nWhen we reflect on our key initiatives and what we believe are the short term market challenges, we're acting as long term Charter shareholders to maximize value. So we have a posture of expectancy and excitement for the opportunity to execute on initiatives that enhance our long term growth rate and value for Charter shareholders. In the short term, we are leaving no stone unturned as it relates to our go to market approach. Ultimately, the speed at which we can return to a more normalized broadband growth rate hinges on the assumption that our competitors' capital is not limitless for poor ROI projects and, frankly, our execution on our strategic initiatives.\nSo we're keeping our heads down and executing on a clear strategy to ensure we can offer customers the best products and services across our entire footprint, all while saving customers money not only now but in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 61,000 internet customers in the fourth quarter while video customers declined by 257,000. In mobile, we added 546,000 mobile lines and wireline voice customers declined by 251,000. Our Spectrum One product continued to perform well. Customers that signed up for our Spectrum One product in the fourth quarter of 2022 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Those promotional roll-offs didn't drive incremental internet churn in the quarter. We had slightly lower mobile line gross adds year over year tied to internet gross additions with a lower churn rate year over year, and flat sequentially. We continue to see healthy data usage at our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines will perform well as long-term customers.\nTurning to rural, we ended the year with 420,000 subsidized rural passings and grew those passings by 295,000 in 2023, in line with our target, and by 105,000 in the fourth quarter alone, an acceleration from this 78,000 we activated during the third quarter. Customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint also accelerated with 34,000 net customer additions in the quarter. As Slide 13 shows, we're generating customer penetrations of close to 50% in cohorts that have reached or passed the 12-month mark. In 2024, we expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings, about 50% more than in 2023, with seasonality in the first quarter tied to the winter weather. Slide 12 shows that so far, with additional state bids that we expect, we will have committed to build approximately 1.75 million subsidized rural passings.\nWe also expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule.\nMoving to financial results. Starting on slide 7, over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.3%, with video-only customer churn partly offset by new customer growth driven by Internet. Residential revenue per customer relationship was up 0.1% year over year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, mostly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nAs slide 7 shows, in total, residential revenue was flat year over year. Residential Internet ARPU grew by 2.2% year over year but by 3.4% when excluding the impact of Spectrum One GAAP revenue allocation out of Internet into mobile. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year over year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.7% year over year.\nEnterprise revenue grew 3.8% year over year driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.5% year over year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, Enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%.\nQ4 advertising revenue declined by 23.4% or $130 million year over year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 0.7% year over year due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nOther revenue grew by 24.4% year over year, driven by higher mobile device sales, and in total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 0.3% year over year and up 1.3% year over year when excluding advertising.\nMoving to operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses declined by 0.7% year over year. Programming costs declined by 10.6% year over year due to a decline in video customers of 6.8% year over year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates for the full year 2024. We expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year over year with our video package mix being the largest variable.\nOther cost of revenue increased by 15% primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower ad sales costs.\nCost to service customers increased by 2.1% year over year, driven by additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by productivity improvements including from 10-year investments and lower service transactions per customer. Looking forward, I would note that our previous investments related to job structure, pay, and benefits to build a more skilled and longer-tenured workforce are now largely complete, and service transaction trends are back on trajectory. After the programming dispute in September.\nSales and marketing costs declined by 1.6%, primarily driven by lower labor costs. Finally, other expenses grew by 1.5% driven by labor costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 1.6% year over year in the quarter and by 3.6% when excluding advertising. Turning to net income on Slide 9, we generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year, driven by a pension remeasurement loss and higher interest expense, partly offset by a gain on the sale of towers and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, just below last year's fourth quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $978 million, $50 million.\nHigher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfields, and market fill-in opportunities.\nFourth quarter capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by lower spend on scalable infrastructure and lower spend on CPE due to purchase timing, partly offset by higher spend on upgrade rebuild, primarily network evolution.\nFor the full year 2023, we spent $11.1 billion.\nLooking ahead at full year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. On slide 11, we've provided our current expectations for capital spending through the year 2027, excluding any possible line extension spend associated with the BEAD program. This slide divides our spending into three categories: line extensions, network evolution, and core CapEx spend. As the slide shows, we expect CapEx spend of just over $12 billion in 2024 to fall to approximately $8 billion by 2027.\nOur line extension CapEx includes spending for greenfield market fill in and serviceability builds from our legacy footprint, driving continued expansion of residential and commercial passings. In turn, our non-rural passings growth should continue to be robust and similar to 2023 growth, subject to the pace of overall housing growth. These passings are natural extensions or pocket fill-ins to our network and have a long track record of low-cost per passing and reliable penetration trends to contribute to growth at attractive ROIs.\nWe have not included the potential impact of BEAD in the passings figures on Slide 12 or in our CapEx outlook on Slide 11. Given the regulatory and bidding uncertainty associated with the program, we don't expect any potential BEAD build subject to acceptable guidelines as Chris mentioned to begin until 2025. Similar to our peers and competitors, our success in bids will be an overlay to our capital expenditure outlook.\nTurning to network evolution, where our long-term capital expenditures outlook remains essentially unchanged, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve our network to offer multi-gigabit speeds.\nFinally, core capital expenditures, which excludes line extensions and network evolution, has remained consistent as a percentage of revenue since 2021, and following the completion of our Network Evolution initiative, capital expenditures excluding line extensions, as a percentage of RE revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels, which has important long-term cash flow implications.\nTurning to free cash flow on slide 14, free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $75 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by a less favorable change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures, partly offset by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nJust a brief comment on cash taxes for 2024 before turning to the balance sheet. We currently expect our calendar year 2024 cash tax payments under current legislation to land between $1.5 billion and 1.9 billion, depending on a number of factors.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principal. In the first weeks of 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured floating rate notes and paid in full all of our outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes, so we no longer have any significant debt maturities due in 2024. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in the next three years at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $90 million or 2% of that run rate interest expense as of the end of the fourth quarter. Our ratio of net debt to last 12 months.\nAdjusted EBITDA was 4.42x and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter we repurchased 3.2 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.3 billion at an average price of $419 per share.\nBefore turning the call over to Q and A, I want to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program for internet and mobile customers. While we still hope the ACP program will be allocated additional funding, we're well aware that the program could end this spring, and we're designing programs to assist those that are on the ACP program. There's no doubt that the end of the program would be disruptive for many. Nonetheless, we will have the full benefit of our high-quality sales and retention force, as well as our mobile product, which saves customers hundreds of dollars to preserve connections.\nWith the continued temporary impact from fixed wireless and the potential end of ACP, we may continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds as we enter 2024. Despite those short-term challenges, we are competing well and are focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024. A component of that has been to reflect inflation in our pricing while preserving value to our customers. We're also actively managing expenses, and we believe we can do so without impacting our sales, service, and broader growth initiatives. But most importantly, we remain focused on the long term and a return to more normalized internet growth. We have what we believe are the best products at the best prices in our industry, and we remain underpenetrated relative to our long-term potential. Taking advantage of that opportunity is what will ultimately create the most shareholder value.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star five on your touchtone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star five again, that is Star five to ask a question. We'll pause for a moment to allow the questions to queue.\nThank you. Our first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. One for Chris and one for Jessica. For Chris. I'm wondering if you can give us some context on whether there was a change in competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. As we look out across the fixed wireless guys and the fiber guys, it seemed pretty steady over the course of the last few quarters, the sort of competitive pressures that seem to stabilize, and I'm wondering if there was just a bigger focus on.\nFrom fixed wireless or potentially fiber in your market specifically. And then for Jessica, the cash tax guidance is great. If bonus depreciation is expanded, extended this year, how much would that cash tax.\nGo down by? Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood. So, you know, in terms of the competitive environment in Q4, as you mentioned, you know, we saw some continued expansion of fixed wireless footprint within the quarter. We also saw heavier competitive marketing and some aggressive promotions from both fixed wireless and from the overbuilders. As you know, Jonathan, slight impacts to gross ads, and in this case it was particularly on the gross ads front, can drive what appear to be outsized changes to net adds, especially when net adds are slightly positive or slightly negative, really has an outsized impact. As you know, we're of course focused very much on the long term, but that doesn't mean that we're not focused on the short term either, particularly what was going on inside of Q4.\nAs I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really leaving no stone unturned on potential ways to improve go-to-market in the short term, particularly addressing gross adds in the existing footprint. We're doing all that, though, looking at all aspects, but trying to make sure that we do that in a controlled fashion and don't overreact either, given that it is small changes that are driving an outsized impact here.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, and I'd add on the environment wasn't consistent through the quarter. Early on we had some carryover from the Disney dispute and the August rate event that we talked about in last quarter's call. We had expected November and December to recover to the levels that we had seen going into that event and they didn't. But as we exited the quarter, we saw December slightly negative and January net adds are consistent with what we saw in December. So that environment does continue.\nOn the cash tax side, Jonathan. So it's not just bonus, it's also R&D and interest expense deductions that will impact us. But I would say the reforms that are being considered support the economics of our investments in connecting rural America and upgrading the network. And so we're fully in support of them. I think it's a little premature to adjust our guidance, but given the investments that we're making, we do expect there to be a material benefit to to cash taxes if the legislation were to go through.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Luke, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nResearch Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nHi, thank you. A couple of questions, Jessica, thank you for the comments you made about ACP. I'm wondering if you can just try to quantify a little bit more for us the number of ACP subscribers that you have and if you have insight into how many of those are new subscribers versus previously were paying subscribers. And then I wonder if you could also just comment about T-Mobile indicated that they expect 100 to 150,000 fewer net adds per quarter in fixed wireless. How do you think about that flowing into your footprint, and does that inform the way you think about the broadband?\nGrowth rate going forward?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSo maybe I start off with ACP and just take a step back, and then Jessica can answer what you were requesting. The ACP program, I think, as everybody knows, it really has brought internet connectivity to customers who would not have been able to have access to broadband otherwise. But more importantly, it's allowed customers who would have been, you know, coming in and out of the broadband marketplace, given affordability issues, to remain connected consistently. So we really think, as you know, it's been an effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. We still, we're hopeful that the ACP can be refunded in order to keep households that are in the program today connected to the internet. But if it's not refunded, Craig, we're going to work very hard to keep customers connected. And we've been working on this possibility for some time.\nWe have significant tools to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars, as Jessica mentioned. I'd highlight that. Keep in mind, most of our ACP customers were internet customers before the ACP program began. In the meantime, having said all that, it's actually pretty challenging for us to predict the impact that a potential end of the program is going to have on our customer disconnects, but we're going to report that consistently over time.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So on the numbers side, Craig, we have a little over 5 million households that receive the ACP benefit, all for wireline internet. Very few of those customers used ACP to upgrade to higher speeds or take more PSUs when they began receiving the benefit. But many do have our flagship speed or higher or do take other services from us. So.\nI guess.\nThe funding will continue through April.\nWe'll try to keep people informed as we move through the process, but from our perspective, there's not a lot of visibility at this point as to anything that might happen when the program ends.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nIn the end, you know, we're still focused on trying to make sure that ACP is refunded. I still think there's a strong possibility that could be the case.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. Do you want to talk? So the fixed wireless, lower net add guidance.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So we noted the same thing that you saw, Craig. I think the bigger point there is that there is a rational approach to the marketplace and the utilization of spectrum. And I'm, I believe, a recognition that there's a limited amount of capacity, that bandwidth needs are increasing. I think that was the bigger takeaway from us. It's very difficult for us to sit back and take a look at the geographic footprint of fixed wireless access because it almost changes by the day in terms of sector availability on radios, in terms of capacity, and where they're actively marketing and where they're not. And then you have the additional rural footprint versus urban, and suburban, and what would be off footprint for us versus on footprint, and the split between residential and commercial, which makes it pretty difficult to mathematically cascade that into an impact for us.\nBut I thought it was rational what was said, and I thought it made a lot of sense, and I think it's consistent with what we've always thought. Frankly, the piece that's been more difficult is just the timing in terms of where that capacity is reached. And it's been a little bit harder to predict than we would like to. But I took that as the same way that you did, that it should have some positive impact on our existing footprint.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Craig.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYep.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nLuke, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Chris. Question for you on CapEx. And then I want to ask Jessica about sort of EBITDA growth. Chris, you've been around the cable industry for a long time, so I know you are aware that kind of investment priorities can change over time. And I'm just curious why you felt it made sense to sort of guide out to 2027 just because you're in a competitive, dynamic industry and want to evolve your strategy over time. It did seem like you guys have, and you can disagree, but it seems like you've prioritized the line extensions over getting network evolution done by 2025. I know we thought it might slip into 2026, but now it's definitely slipping into 2026. Just wanted to understand your thought process there. If that was tied to equipment availability or just a strategic decision, then.\nJessica, there's an expectation that 2024 is a good EBITDA growth year for Charter, given the investments you've made in OpEx. I think you cited 3.5% growth in Q4 advertising. Anything you can tell us to help us think about financial performance for the business in 2024 would be appreciated. Thanks everyone.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So Ben, I think, you know, leading into the last earnings call, we had been listening to shareholder feedback about the difficulty people were having of projecting long-term CapEx trends given the significant capital investment opportunities that we have. And you're right, typically we would never provide a multi-year outlook, and we've about the only guidance that we've historically provided is in-year CapEx guidance. But these are, these are unique opportunities that don't come around very often. The opportunity to have subsidized rural build having the largest expansion of broadband and cable footprint really since the 1980s is unique, and it's generational. And I think, I think we felt that investors needed to see A, the size and magnitude of what we were already committed to, and B, to have a very articulated outline of the returns of those investments which Jessica's provided.\nWe've been providing that, you know, all that information, essentially what we've provided over the past two years. But to do it in a single spot so people could wrap their heads around both the quantum that exists, the investment returns that are attached to that investment, and that it doesn't go on into perpetuity and that there is a real nice setup for what this is all about, which is free cash flow growth. And so while we typically like to keep our cards close to our chest to preserve both flexibility and to maintain our competitive posture, we felt there was a trade off here to make sure that our shareholders were with us and that people understood the value of the returns of the investment that we're making. And so there's a balance here between.\none hand, having the flexibility to always make the right decisions to generate long-term free cash flow and making sure that we're responsive to shareholder feedback along the way, and that we can demonstrate the long-term value. So people take comfort with that. You know, in terms of the prioritization of line extensions over the DAA or DOCSIS 4 upgrade, it wasn't so much about prioritization. It was really about the certification of the DAA equipment taking a little bit longer, which pushing out the timeline for the rollout.\nAnd so the trade off we had is, could you do it the 1.2 GHz high split upgrade under what we call an integrated CMTS environment and do more of that footprint to keep the original pace, or should we slow it down just a tad to make sure that we allowed for a catch up of the DAA certification process so that you could move to high split with distributed access architecture as well as the 1.8 GHz and the rollout of DOCSIS 4.0. We chose the latter to make sure that we were having as much of the footprint with the full capabilities of DOCSIS 4.0 over time. You know, if, you know, the caveat is if we get into, you know, a couple years from now, we see opportunities to pull capital forward.\nWe'll of course do that, but this is our best view of where we're going to spend capital. We thought it was worthwhile to show that, to make sure people understand that it doesn't, that higher level of capital expenditure doesn't go on into perpetuity.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThank you. Yeah. On the EBITDA performance inside of 2024.\nI guess I'm not going to give EBITDA guidance, but I think we can talk about the few things. You do have a political advertising year that is a tailwind we have. We've fully lapped the investments that we made in the employee population. From an expense outlook perspective, I think my expectation is that we'll be able to keep cost to serve essentially flat on an absolute basis. In sales and marketing, you might have some growth, but it'll be small in the 2% to 3% range. We continue, as I said in my remarks. We're taking a look at expenses all across the business to identify areas where we can be more efficient and reduced costs without impacting our service levels and our sales capabilities.\nSo we fully understand that we need to maintain EBITDA growth in this environment and strong EBITDA growth coming into what, as you note, should be a stronger year.\nIn order to be able to continue focusing on what we want for the long term, which is to be able to invest, to grow in the long term, and to return to that sort of Internet customer growth in the long term. So I think the dynamics in the background are happening to make that growth happen.\nThat's where we are.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Ben.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Ben. Luke, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. Thanks for that, caller. Jessica, just a follow up on EBITDA growth and one of the components, revenue per customer. It's been relatively flat for the last couple of quarters. There's a lot of moving parts in terms of pricing and customers rolling off Spectrum One, but how should we think about progressing through 2024, especially with, I think, the most recent data price increase in August? Do you believe your pricing power in the broadband market has changed given the new sort of competitive landscape we have, or can you continue to push pricing?\nAs that lapse mid-year number one? And then on the mobile strategy.\nAnything you can tell us about what mobile is doing in terms of lowering churn in the broadband market? Is it also helping you in terms of new connects and driving new subscribers, or just really churn reduction? And then anything we should expect to change as you sort of proceed with some of the build out measures you're taking to add your own capacity?\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, so I'll start with ARPU.\nWhen you look at average revenue per customer overall, John.\nThe biggest factor that's keeping it flat is the rate of video penetration. So what matters there is the extent to which we can retain video customers with some of the package and pricing strategies that we have. If you isolate and you sort of pull out Internet ARPU, you can see even in the remarks that I made on the quarter that Internet ARPU continues to grow. When you pull out the Spectrum One mobile allocation, it continues to grow at a rate that's consistent or even a little higher than historical level.\nOn the mobile side. I talked about it on the last call.\nAs you have. So because we've sort of lapsed the free line offer, the number of free lines that we have in the system over the course of 2024 is more steady than it was in 2023. So you'll also see that the impact of that mobile allocation over to Internet should steady over time.\nAnd you'll have, just as a matter of math, more paying customers in the base as a proportion relative to the free lines. So I think that's the piece there. I don't know. Chris, you want to talk about pricing power?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. In broadband, our fundamental view hasn't changed: that in the long term, keeping your prices as low as you can both enhances your ability to grow, and that's still our long-term objective. It reduces churn, and it reduces the likelihood that somebody views you as an attractive overbuilt candidate. So our fundamental views haven't changed. Having said that, we've had inflationary pressures, and we've been passing that through to the best of our ability. To the extent that our pricing is lower, and it is for the most part across the industry, I view that as a positive long-term capacity question and from an ability to grow. But it doesn't mean that we're immune to inflation. It doesn't mean that we're not willing to pass through increases as we need to.\nThere's a balance here as well that, in an environment where we're investing so much into expansion, making sure that we do maintain EBITDA growth rates so that we can keep that engine going. It matters to us, and it matters to our shareholders. We're focused on that in parallel. There's a balance that's taking place. I think we're in a, you know, not only in a good position overall, but I think a very good relative position in terms of the overall market. You know, you've seen different operators across the sector moving their prices up over time as well. I think that demonstrates that there's real value to the product, and there's a need to recover cost along the way. It's a capital-intensive business.\nAnd then your last question on John is mobile churn.\nThe contribution of mobile to the broadband business. The biggest factor so far, as you highlighted, really has been a significant and a very material amount of churn reduction that takes place on those customers who attach mobile. As I mentioned, it's only 13% of our base today. I'd offer you two pieces. One is on the positive side. It is dramatic, the churn reduction, just to be balanced. There's still self-selection that exists inside that base. So I want to be careful that we don't overplay the benefit there on what's still a relatively small portion of our Internet base, and growing, and has big upside. The new connects.\nYou know, those new internet connects who take mobile, that percentage of our mobile acquisition mix that comes from new customers has risen over the years. Is that because we do a better job of selling into call center and attaching, or is it because mobile is actually driving gross adds in this environment where you have so many different moving parts? I'm not comfortable telling you that it's been a big driver as of yet of new sales. But I think that's the opportunity not only for churn reduction but as convergence continues to take hold as these products work together in a way that our competitors can't replicate. The ability to use Spectrum One, the combination of broadband internet, WiFi, and 5G is our backup radio. It's the slowest portion of our network and have the fastest overall connectivity.\nService and seamless connectivity makes powerful, and I think it has the ability not just reduce churn, which it's already doing today, but to actually drive acquisition over time. And so we're early on, but still very exciting.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThank you.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, John. Luke, we'll take our next question, please. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning.\nI have a couple of questions on the subject of growth investment. Slide 11 discusses cost per core passing in your forecast of 2,000 to 2,500. That struck me as high relative to historical core passings and even relative to fiber expansion. So I wanted to see what.\nYou could share about your assumptions for?\nPenetration and ARPU in that footprint. Then on a related note, again on core growth investment. But moving over to BEAD, we've seen big increases over the last couple of years since the money for BEAD was allocated in the availability and uptake of fixed wireless services over mid-band. We expect more increases in the availability of LEO satellite services, not just Starlink but Amazon's product.\nAnd so, I'm wondering if your outlook.\nFor penetration in that potential BEAD footprint is moderating, and if that affects your appetite at all. Thank you.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So I'll start on the cost per passing question.\nWhat you see there is related to the mix between commercial and even enterprise passing and residential passing. So the cost per resi passing that lives inside of that is closer to $1,500. What's happening is that there are, I'm going to say a smaller number but a larger dollar amount of commercial passings that are included in the mix that drive the average cost per passing to be a little bit higher. And we were just trying to give enough information there to get you to a reasonable passing estimate.\nSo you can model off of that what gains you would generate from the build.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nAnd then in terms of the penetration, Peter, there are very different types of build that sit in there. I mean serviceability, which is where a customer calls us effectively for a one off or two or three additional line extensions. The penetration on that's 85% as it should be. And other areas where greenfield or market fill in, where penetrations can range anywhere between 45% and 70% at a lower cost per passing, as Jessica highlighted, than some of the other extension build that we do. So the returns are very, very attractive. They always have been. There's nothing really new there, and somewhat tied to that. You asked about our views on penetration generally, but in the context of BEAD with fixed wireless access or Low Earth Orbit satellite LEO, I think the. Let me start with LEO. This is an expensive offering on a per month basis.\nExpensive from a CPE standpoint. And it needs to be. Because if I told you our network was going to fall to the ground every six to eight years and burn up, you'd tell me that's a pretty capital intensive business and it needs to be priced appropriately. And it is. I think LEO has a really good use in certain cases, but it's typically not going to be where our fiber based network is deployed. And so it's not something that really has risen too much in terms of our thinking and penetration. Fixed wireless access.\nIt's shown us that you can have lower quality and inferior service at a low price or low incremental price, and there's a market for that. But our penetration expectations for RDOF and for subsidized rural and what will feed into BEAD were already low in terms of what we built into our models compared to what I think ultimately we'll achieve. And so I think that's already reflected inside of our penetrations. If you think about just at the 12-month mark where we're approaching close to 50% in these subsidized rural passings, our initial thoughts were we'd be at half of that within a year. And so we're way ahead of that.\nI think the terminal penetration will be higher than what we thought at RDOF, despite the fact that there's an admittedly stronger fixed wireless access presence now than there was three, four years ago when we made those commitments. So all a big roundabout way to say I think it's factored into all of our thinking and I don't think it changes our view in terms of where we'll ultimately get to for terminal penetration because we weren't overly aggressive in what we assumed.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, and.\nWe mentioned the less than 50% or the 50% or so at about the 12-month-plus mark. But as you can see in what we provided and all of the cohorts that we're seeing, we're still growing at a good rate at that point. So it's not as though you've reached the customers who are going to get your product and then we're not seeing additional growth. We're still seeing good growth in those markets even at that vintage.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nIt's early, it's going well.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nOperator, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the competitive environment.\nJust based upon the previous response. Just any help on thinking about the fixed wireless impact in terms of your. Is that just isolated or the competitive environment that has perhaps shifted in Q4 and persisted into January? Is that isolated in your non fiber overlap territories or you're seeing that as well? Be somewhat impactful in terms of share as well in the one gig market. And a quick follow up to that. Any update we can get on overlap for fiber as it stands exiting the year and then on the CBRS build out. Obviously your peer Comcast have been testing along with you for quite a while, but they're live in Philadelphia as well as some other markets. Any update on how the team's thinking about CBRS and how you're perhaps offload strategy over the next several years? Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications",
    "content2": "There's a lot there, Sebastiano, but here we go.\nSo, fixed wireless impact.\nIt's where they've deployed, and it's in both fiber and non-fiber overlap. It's more acute in the non-fiber overlap because it's the first time that somebody's had what they view as an alternative other than DSL. And so it has a novelty factor in the non-overbuild footprint that is similar to a fiber overbuild that has an immediate short-term impact when it's new into the marketplace. So it has a more pronounced impact there. But I think the overbuilders, the wireline overbuilders, would tell you that fixed wireless access probably has had an impact on them as well. So it's not that it doesn't have an impact in an overbuilder territory; it's just much more pronounced in an area where the overbuild doesn't exist. Our overbuild percentage in our 10-K today, I think, we disclosed as well that it's roughly 50% in terms of overbuild.\nAnd then as it relates to CBRS, we are, you know, fully deployed and active, you know, with thousands of radio access networks out on the strand and MDUs in one large market today, and we're expanding into another market at some point this year, and that's going very well. And the pacing of that really is dictated by a few things. One is our relationship with Verizon is good and strong, the economics are great, and this is an ROI based deployment. So it'll be there, the returns will be there when we deploy. But interestingly, the more penetrated we become, the more attractive the returns get. And so from a deployment of capital perspective, CBRS is very exciting.\nIt's a very clear mathematical return, but an environment where we're deploying as much capital as we are and we have so much active activity on the outside plant in terms of high split upgrade and construction of new networks. You know, we're just pacing it along the way to manage all those factors in the way that we think about deployment of CBRS. But we're going to fully deploy it. It's exciting; it has a great return. The depth at which we employed in each market really is a function of utilization on a geographically specific area and the.\nAttractive agreement and the great relationship that we have with Verizon today. So that's strategic to us. So all those factors play into the timing.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nSenior Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I'll now turn the call back over to Stefan Aninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, operator. Thanks everyone. We'll see you next quarter.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[Background Music]\n\nBackground Music\n\nSa.\nIt.\nSa.\n\nOperator\n\nHello and welcome to the Charter Communications Q4 conference call. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings which we encourage you to read carefully. Various remarks that we make on today's call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Stefan. In 2023, we added 155,000 internet customers, and we added nearly two and a half million Spectrum Mobile lines for growth of nearly 50%. At the end of 2023, we had more than 7.7 million total mobile lines. Only 13% of our internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years as the quality and value of our converged connectivity services gains wider recognition. Revenue was up by 1% in 2023 while EBITDA grew by 1.3% and 2.5% when excluding advertising. While we're executing well on our long-term strategic initiatives and Spectrum One is working to drive mobile growth, internet growth in our existing footprint has been challenging, driven by admittedly more persistent competition from fixed wireless and similar levels of wireline overbuild activity.\nSmall changes in gross additions and churn in a low transaction environment have driven outsized impacts to net gains, which was clearly the case as we moved through the last quarter. I own that. So let me start with what we believe on the competitive environment and then what we're doing to drive long-term growth by delivering high-quality products and service at a great price. Fixed wireless access, while an inferior product with limited capacity and geographic coverage, which is fluid, is often marketed by the phone companies at a perceived lower price to their existing customers. We continue to believe the impact from fixed wireless is temporary.\nOur Internet product is faster and more reliable, our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. Customer bandwidth needs continue to increase, and MNOs will face capacity challenges and will be required to allocate their spectrum and capital to maintain profitable mobile services. While we can't promise when that happens, I believe bandwidth needs increase and quality and value win. On the wireline overbuild front, we continue to compete well. Overbuild impact tends to be limited to a few percentage points of Internet penetration during the first year of a new overbuild vintage coming online. It's painful, but it's tied to the pace of overbuild. We don't see overbuilders reaching their penetration and ROI goals now within our footprint or in the future. They don't have the same ubiquitous convergence capabilities as we do. Their lower-cost passings have likely been built.\nSome of the planned overbuild was duplicative between operators, meaning less opportunity and incremental financing costs have increased, putting even more pressure on overbuilder returns. We also expect bid passings will provide better capital allocation and ROI for many of these operators. Our assumption is that our competitors are rational economic players with shareholders and balance sheets which require adequate return on investment that isn't within our control. We are focused on the key strategic initiatives that enhance our long-term competitiveness and growth capabilities, and we expect to return to a more normalized internet growth over time. Just over a year from when we detailed those initiatives, I wanted to remind everyone of their rationale and update you on their status. As laid out in Slide 4, our footprint expansion is beating our pacing, penetration, ARPU, and ROI targets.\nNew construction will help drive internet customer growth despite the temporary challenges I mentioned within our existing footprint. 2023 subsidized rural customer growth was already over 100,000. Our penetration also continues to grow at a better than expected pace and will activate more subsidized rural passings this year, both of which Jessica will cover. BEAD will provide additional opportunities, although the potential is uncertain given our concerns regarding how states will apply NTIA guidelines; we'll focus BEAD investments in states where the rules are conducive to private investment. Outside of rural, we also have accelerated greenfield market fill in and serviceability builds, expanding our existing footprint in both residential and commercial passings. Penetration curves and returns here are similarly strong and predictable with a lower build cost.\nWe also remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience via our Execution initiative, which is intended to enhance frontline employees' tenure while simultaneously investing in digitization, all to drive better sales yields, higher quality transactions, lower overall service transactions, and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our targeted investments in employees over the last two years resulted in a significant reduction in employee attrition in 2023. Our investments in the digitization of service are also driving efficiencies in 2024. We have a number of new automated platforms that are launching to facilitate better service for customers and better digital and AI tools for agents to enhance service quality and the quality of their day-to-day jobs. And finally, our Evolution initiative which includes our Network Evolution project, convergence efforts, and our video product development all remain on course.\nWe fully launched symmetrical speed tiers in two markets and currently launching in six more, completing our Step one markets. We'll also begin to work in our Step two markets with DAA later this year, excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project. We continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. We expect to complete the project in 2026, so a fast, ubiquitous, low-cost upgrade of our capabilities which our competitors can't replicate. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and grow. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and the Spectrum Mobile network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotional and at retail. Spectrum One customers reaching their first anniversary are performing ahead of our expectations.\nWe'll continue to evolve our converged offering in 2024 with additional features and capabilities.\nFinally turning to the evolution of our video product, in October we launched the Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the U.S. Xumo is our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're approaching 1 million deployed Xumo boxes since launch and we've been getting great customer feedback and we can keep improving our attach rates. In early January, Disney became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost and in the next several months ESPN and ViX, a Spanish-language DTC product, will both become available to certain TV Select customers at no extra cost.\nThis new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers, and we plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal. That means packaging flexibility, value, and not asking customers or Charter to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. Our new hybrid distribution model combined with Xumo's Content Forward interface provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value, and utility with seamless linear DTC and SVOD integration and advanced search and discovery functionality.\nWhen we reflect on our key initiatives and what we believe are the short term market challenges, we're acting as long term Charter shareholders to maximize value. So we have a posture of expectancy and excitement for the opportunity to execute on initiatives that enhance our long term growth rate and value for Charter shareholders. In the short term, we are leaving no stone unturned as it relates to our go to market approach. Ultimately, the speed at which we can return to a more normalized broadband growth rate hinges on the assumption that our competitors capital is not limitless for poor ROI projects and frankly our execution on our strategic initiatives.\nSo we're keeping our heads down and executing on a clear strategy to ensure we can offer customers the best products and services across our entire footprint, all while saving customers money not only now but in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 61,000 Internet customers in Q4 while video customers declined by 257,000. In mobile, we added 546,000 mobile lines, and wireline voice customers declined by 251,000. Our Spectrum One product continued to perform well. Customers that signed up for our Spectrum One product in Q4 of 2022 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Those promotional roll-offs didn't drive incremental Internet churn in the quarter. We had slightly lower mobile line gross adds year-over-year tied to Internet gross additions with a lower churn rate year-over-year and flat sequentially. We continue to see healthy data usage on our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines will perform well as long-term customers.\nTurning to rural, we ended the year with 420,000 subsidized rural passings and grew those passings by 295,000 in 2023 in line with our target and by 105,000 in the fourth quarter alone, an acceleration from this 78,000 we activated during the third quarter. Customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint also accelerated with 34,000 net customer additions in the quarter. As slide 13 shows, we're generating customer penetrations of close to 50% in cohorts that have reached or passed the 12-month mark. In 2024, we expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings, about 50% more than in 2023 with seasonality in the first quarter tied to the winter weather. Slide 12 shows that so far, with additional state bids that we expect we will have committed to build approximately 1.75 million subsidized rural passings.\nWe also expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule.\nMoving to financial results. Starting on slide 7, over the last year residential customers declined by 0.3%, with video-only customer churn partly offset by new customer growth driven by Internet. Residential revenue per customer relationship was up 0.1% year over year given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, mostly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nAs slide 7 shows, in total residential revenue was flat year over year. Residential Internet ARPU grew by 2.2% year over year, but by 3.4% when excluding the impact of Spectrum One. Revenue allocation out of Internet into mobile. Turning to commercial SMB revenue, declined by 0.9% year over year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.7% year over year.\nEnterprise revenue grew 3.8% year over year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.5% year over year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%.\nFourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23.4% or $130 million year over year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 0.7% year over year due to a more challenged advertising market partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nOther revenue grew by 24.4% year over year, driven by higher mobile device sales, and in total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 0.3% year over year and up 1.3% year over year when excluding advertising.\nMoving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses declined by 0.7% year over year. Programming costs declined by 10.6% year over year due to a decline in video customers of 6% year over year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. For the full year 2024, we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the 1 to 2% range year over year, with our video package mix being the largest variable. Other cost of revenue increased by 15%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower ad sales costs.\nCost to service customers increased by 2.1% year over year, driven by additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by productivity improvements including from 10-year investments and lower service transactions per customer. Looking forward, I would note that our previous investments related to job structure, pay, and benefits to build a more skilled and longer-tenured workforce are now largely complete, and service transaction trends are back on trajectory after the programming dispute in September.\nSales and marketing costs declined by 1.6%, primarily driven by lower labor costs. Finally, other expenses grew by 1.5%, driven by labor costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 1.6% year over year in the quarter and by 3.6% when excluding advertising. Turning to net income on Slide 9, we generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year, driven by a pension remeasurement loss and higher interest expense, partly offset by a gain on the sale of towers and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, just below last year's fourth quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $978 million, $50 million.\nHigher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfield, and market fill-in opportunities.\nFourth quarter capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by lower spend on scalable infrastructure and lower spend on CPE due to purchase timing, partly offset by higher spend on upgrade rebuild, primarily network evolution. For the full year 2023, we spent $11.1 billion.\nLooking ahead at full year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. On slide 11, we've provided our current expectations for capital spending through the year 2027 excluding any possible line extension spend associated with the BEAD program. This slide divides our spending into three categories: Line Extensions, Network Evolution, and core CapEx spend. As the slide shows, we expect CapEx spend of just over $12 billion in 2024 to fall to approximately $8 billion by 2027.\nOur line extension CapEx includes spending for greenfield market fill-in and serviceability builds from our legacy footprint, driving continued expansion of residential and commercial passings. In turn, our non-rural passings growth should continue to be robust and similar to 2023 growth, subject to the pace of overall housing growth. These passings are natural extensions or pocket fill-ins to our network and have a long track record of low-cost per passing and reliable penetration trends to contribute to growth at attractive ROIs.\nWe've not included the potential impact of BEAD in the passing figures on slide 12 or in our CapEx outlook on slide 11. Given the regulatory and bidding uncertainty associated with the program, we don't expect any potential BEAD build subject to acceptable guidelines as Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025. Similar to our peers and competitors, our success in BEAD will be an overlay to our capital expenditure outlook.\nTurning to network evolution, where our long-term capital expenditures outlook remains essentially unchanged, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve our network to offer multi-gigabit speeds.\nFinally, core capital expenditures, which excludes line extensions and network evolution, has remained consistent as a percentage of revenue since 2021, and following the completion of our Network Evolution initiative, capital expenditures excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue should decline to below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications.\nTurning to free cash flow on slide 14, free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $75 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by a less favorable change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures, partly offset by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nJust a brief comment on cash taxes for 2024 before turning to the balance sheet. We currently expect our calendar year 2024 cash tax payments under current legislation to land between $1.5 billion and 1.9 billion depending on a number of factors.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principal. In the first weeks of 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured floating rate notes and paid in full all of our outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes, so we no longer have any significant debt maturities due in 2024. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinance all of our debt due in the next three years at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $90 million or 2% of that run rate interest expense.\nAs of the end of Q4, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month Adjusted EBITDA was 4.42x and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.3 billion at an average price of $419 per share.\nBefore turning the call over to Q and A, I want to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program for internet and mobile customers. While we still hope the ACP Program will be allocated additional funding, we're well aware that the Program could end this spring and we're designing programs to assist those that are on the ACP Program.\nThere is no doubt that the end of the program would be disruptive for many. Nonetheless, we will have the full benefit of our high quality sales and retention force as well as our mobile product which saves customers hundreds of dollars to preserve connections.\nWith the continued temporary impact from Fixed Wireless and the potential end of ACP, we may continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds as we enter 2024. Despite those short-term challenges, we are competing well and are focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024. A component of that has been to reflect inflation in our pricing while preserving value to our customers. We're also actively managing expenses, and we believe we can do so without impacting our sales, service, and broader growth initiatives. But most importantly, we remain focused on the long term and a return to more normalized internet growth. We have what we believe are the best products at the best prices in our industry, and we remain under-penetrated relative to our long-term potential. Taking advantage of that opportunity is what will ultimately create the most shareholder value.\nWe're now ready for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star five on your touchtone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star five again, that is star five to ask a question. We'll pause for a moment to allow the questions to queue.\nThank you. Our first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nThanks, guys. One for Chris and one for Jessica. For Chris. I'm wondering if you can give us some context on whether there was a change in competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. As we look out across the fixed wireless guys and the fiber guys, it seemed pretty steady over the course of the last few quarters. The sort of competitive pressures that seemed to stabilize. And I'm wondering if there was just a bigger focus on.\nFrom fixed wireless or potentially fiber in your market specifically. And then for Jessica, the cash tax guidance is great. If bonus depreciation is expanded, extended this year, how much would that cash tax.\nGo down by? Thank you.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nGood. So, you know, in terms of the competitive environment in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, you know, we saw some continued expansion of fixed wireless footprint within the quarter. We also saw heavier competitive marketing and some aggressive promotions from both fixed wireless and from the overbuilders. As you know, Jonathan, slight impacts to gross adds and churn, in this case it was particularly on the gross adds front, can drive what appear to be outsized changes to net adds, especially when net adds are slightly positive or slightly negative, really has an outsized impact. As you know, we're of course focused very much on the long term. But that doesn't mean that we're not focused on the short term either, particularly what was going on inside of the fourth quarter.\nSo as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really leaving no stone unturned on potential ways to improve go to market in the short term, particularly addressing gross adds in the existing footprint. We're doing all that though, looking at all aspects, but trying to make sure that we do that in a controlled fashion and don't overreact either, given that it is small changes that are driving an outsized impact here.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah, and I'd add on the environment wasn't consistent through the quarter. Early on we had some carryover from the Disney dispute and the August rate event that we talked about in last quarter's call. We had expected November and December to recover to the levels that we had seen going into that event and they didn't. But as we exited the quarter, we saw December slightly negative, and January net adds are consistent with what we saw in December. So that environment does continue.\nOn the cash tax side, Jonathan. So it's not just bonus, it's also R and D, and interest expense deductions that will impact us. But I would say the reforms that are being considered support the economics of our investments in connecting rural America and upgrading the network. And so we are fully in support of them. I think it's a little premature to adjust our guidance, but given the investments that we're making, we do expect there to be a material benefit to, to cash taxes if the legislation were to go through.\n\nJonathan Chaplin\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Luke will take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Hi.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nResearch Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. A couple of questions. Jessica, thank you for the comments you made about ACP. I'm wondering if you can just try to quantify a little bit more for us the number of ACP subscribers that you have and if you have insight into how many of those are new subscribers versus previously were paying subscribers. And then I wonder if you could also just comment about T-Mobile indicated that they expect 100 to 150,000 fewer net adds per quarter in fixed wireless. How do you think about that flowing into your footprint and does that inform the way you think about the broadband growth rate going forward?\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSo, maybe I start off with ACP and just take a step back, and then Jessica can answer what you were requesting. The ACP program, I think, as everybody knows, it really has brought internet connectivity to customers who would not have been able to have access to broadband otherwise. But more importantly, it's allowed customers who would have been, you know, coming in and out of the broadband marketplace, given affordability issues, to remain connected consistently. So we really think, as you know, it's been an effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. We still, we're hopeful that the ACP can be refunded in order to keep households that are in the program today connected to the internet. But if it's not refunded, Craig, we're going to work very hard to keep customers connected.\nWe've been working on this possibility for some time. We have significant tools to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars, as Jessica mentioned. I'd highlight that, you know, keep in mind most of our ACP customers were internet customers before the ACP program began. In the meantime, you know, having said all that, it's actually pretty challenging for us to predict the impact that a potential end of the program is going to have to our customer disconnects, but we're going to report that consistently over time.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. So, on the numbers side, Craig, we have a little over five million households that receive the ACP benefit, all for wireline Internet. Very few of those customers used ACP to upgrade to higher speeds or take more PSUs when they began receiving the benefit. But many do have our flagship speed or higher or do take other services from us. So.\nAnd.\nI guess.\nThe funding will continue through April.\nWe'll try to keep people informed as we move through the process, but from our perspective, there's not a lot of visibility at this point as to anything that might happen when the program ends.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nIn the end, we're still focused on trying to make sure that ACP is refunded, and I still think there's a strong possibility that could be the case.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. Do you want to talk? So the fixed wireless lower net add guidance.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So we noted the same thing that you saw, Craig. I think the bigger point there is that there is a rational approach to the marketplace and the utilization of spectrum, and I believe a recognition that there's a limited amount of capacity, that bandwidth needs are increasing. I think that was the bigger takeaway from us. It's very difficult for us to sit back and take a look at the geographic footprint of fixed wireless access, because it almost changes by the day in terms of sector availability on radios, in terms of capacity, and where they're actively marketing and where they're not. And then you have the additional rural footprint versus urban and suburban, and what would be off footprint for us versus on footprint and the split between residential and commercial, which makes it pretty difficult to mathematically cascade that into an impact for us.\nBut I thought it was rational what was said, and I thought it made a lot of sense, and I think it's consistent with what we've always thought. Frankly, the piece that's been more difficult is just the timing in terms of where that capacity is reached, and it's been a little bit harder to predict than we would like. But I took that as the same way that you did, that it should have some positive impact on our existing footprint.\n\nCraig Moffett\n\nResearch Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks, Craig.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nYep.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Charter Communications\n\nLuke, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, Chris. Question for you on CapEx, and then I want to ask Jessica about EBITDA growth. Chris, you've been around the cable industry for a long time. So I know you are aware that kind of investment priorities can change over time. And I'm just curious why you felt it made sense to guide out to 2027 just because you're in a competitive, dynamic industry and want to evolve your strategy over time. It did seem like you guys have, and you can disagree, but it seems like you've prioritized the line extensions over getting network evolution done by 2025. So I know we thought it might slip into 2026, but now it's definitely slipping into 2026. Just wanted to understand your thought process there if that was tied to kind of equipment availability or just a strategic decision.\nAnd then, Jessica, there's an expectation that 2024 is a good EBITDA growth year for Charter. Given the investments you've made in OpEx. I think you cited 3.5% growth in Q4 ex advertising. Anything you can tell us to help us think about financial performance for the business in 2024 would be appreciated.\nThanks everyone.\n\nChris Winfrey\n\nPresident and CEO, Charter Communications\n\nSure. So Ben, I think leading into the last earnings call, we had been listening to shareholder feedback about the difficulty people were having of projecting long-term CapEx trends given the significant capital investment opportunities that we have. And you're right, typically we would never provide a multi-year outlook, and about the only guidance that we've historically provided is in-year CapEx guidance. But these are unique opportunities that don't come around very often. The opportunity to have subsidized rural build, having the largest expansion of broadband and cable footprint really since the 1980s, is unique, and it's generational. And I think we felt that investors needed to see A, the size and magnitude of what we were already committed to, and B, to have a very articulated outline of the returns of those investments which Jessica's provided.\nWe've been providing that, you know, all that information, essentially what we've provided over the past two years, but to do it in a single spot so people could wrap their heads around both the quantum that exist, the investment returns that are attached to that investment, and that it doesn't go on into perpetuity, and that there is a real nice setup for what this is all about, which is free cash flow growth. And so while we typically like to keep our cards close to our chest to preserve both flexibility and to maintain our competitive posture, we felt there was a trade off here to make sure that our shareholders were with us and that people understood the value of the returns of the investment that we're making. And so there's a balance here between.\none hand, having the flexibility to always make the right decisions to generate long-term free cash flow and making sure that we're responsive to shareholder feedback along the way, and that we can demonstrate the long-term value. So people take comfort with that. You know, in terms of the prioritization of line extensions over the DAA or DOCSIS 4 upgrade, it wasn't so much about prioritization; it was really about the certification of the DAA equipment taking a little bit longer, which was pushing out the timeline for the rollout.\nAnd so the trade off we had is, could you do it the 1.2 GHz High Split upgrade under what we call an Integrated CMTS environment and do more of that footprint to keep the original pace, or should we slow it down just a tad to make sure that we allowed for a catch up of the DAA certification process so that you could move to High Split with distributed access architecture as well as the 1.8 GHz and the rollout of DOCSIS 4.0. We chose the latter to make sure that we were having as much of the footprint with the full capabilities of DOCSIS 4.0 over time. You know, if, you know, the caveat is if we get into, you know, a couple years from now, we see opportunities to pull capital forward.\nWe'll of course do that, but this is our best view of where we're going to spend capital.\nWe thought it was worthwhile to show that, to make sure people understand that it doesn't. That higher level of capital expenditure doesn't go on into perpetuity.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications\n\nYeah. On the EBITDA performance inside of 2024.\nI guess I'm not going to give EBITDA guidance, but I think we can talk about the few things. So you do have a political advertising year that is a tailwind.\nWe've fully lapped the investments that we made in the employee population. From an expense outlook perspective, I think my expectation is that we'll be able to keep cost to serve."

[Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI'll now pass you over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome, everyone.\nThe presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website at ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, which we encourage you to read carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call, concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements.\nOn today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO.\nWith that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. During the third quarter, we added 63,000 Internet customers, as we continue to benefit from growth in both our existing footprint and new subsidized rural footprint. We also added nearly 600,000 Spectrum mobile lines, benefiting from our Spectrum One offering.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had over 7 million total mobile lines, and over 12% of our Internet customers now have mobile service. We expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years as the quality and the value of our converged connectivity service gains wider recognition.\nRevenue was essentially flat year-over-year, with some temporary headwinds within the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA grew at 0.7% year-over-year, moving past the low point last quarter. We expect that upward trend to continue as we realize the benefit of our operating investments.\nMore importantly, we're making significant progress against the multiyear strategic initiatives we outlined late last year. Our footprint expansion initiative remains on track. We expect to add approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2023 and to accelerate that pace in 2024. Our penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better-than-expected pace. At the 12-month mark, our rural builds are achieving nearly 50% penetration, faster than our initial expectations.\nOur execution initiative also continues to progress, and we remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in employee tenure and training, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields.\nAdditionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms for both customers and employees will further reduce transactions, driving higher levels of customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction, driving tenure and quality. And finally, our evolution initiative, which is comprised of our network evolution project, our convergence efforts and our video product transformation, all of which remain on track.\nOur network evolution project continues to progress well and will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of customers and competitors everywhere we operate. Unlike the telcos, which prioritize the most attractive footprints for upgrades, our multi-gig speed offerings will be available across our entire footprint. Our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter.\nAnd excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. We're very much on target. Whether we finish our network evolution initiative by the end of 2025 or mid-2026 will really depend on the supply chain for distributed access architecture components and managing annual capital spend, given the larger customer growth opportunity and construction speed of RDOF, where we're ahead of the build requirements and we'll end up with more passings than originally expected, state grants and hopefully beat passings.\nHowever, I want to reiterate and be very clear that where state BEAD rules are not conducive to private investment, we will not participate in those states. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and succeed. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity, with differentiated features like mobile Speed Boost and the Spectrum Mobile Network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers, with market-leading pricing at both promotion and retail.\nFinally, turning to the evolution of our video product. Earlier this month, we launched our Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear and VPD streaming service in the U.S., Xumo is now our go-to-market platform for new video sales.\nIn September, we announced an agreement to carry Disney's linear networks and direct-to-consumer services for our customers. This new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers, and we believe a significant step forward for the video ecosystem.\nFor Charter, the agreement adds value to our video packages and better aligns linear content and DTC apps, which will be included for free in our video products. We also maintained flexibility to offer lower cost packages. Disney gets broader distribution of its DTC products with ad revenues from our video customers and upgrade subscriptions to ad free. We'll also sell Disney's DTC apps to our Internet customers, including via Xumo over time. Together with Disney, we created a glide path to bridge from linear video into new growth with both linear and DTC services.\nDisney and ESPN were a key first step to repairing the video ecosystem, but our goal is to have a product that is valuable and that we're proud to sell. We plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal in a way that works for customers. That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or us to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. If programmers insist on customers paying twice, we just won't carry those channels. But we'd still be happy to sell their content in an a la carte app, same way as they do. Our goal is to modernize these agreements quietly and seamlessly for our mutual customer base.\nOur new hybrid distribution model, combined with Xumo's content forward interface, provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value and utility, with seamless linear DTC and SVOD integration in advanced search and discovery functionality.\nFor Charter and programmers, this creates a state-of-the-art video marketplace, supported by our scaled distribution, sales and service infrastructure, and we believe a glide path to broader distribution, better economics and more choice for everyone.\nThrough expansion, network evolution, convergence, video transformation and investing in quality, we are executing successfully the strategy we laid out last December. Our strategy remains to provide the highest quality products, which we then priced and packaged in customer-friendly ways to drive higher penetration of our services across our footprint. We then combined that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers. Ultimately, continued execution of our strategy will drive significant long-term value for shareholders, and we continue to make good progress.\nBefore handing the call over to Jessica, I want to note that earlier this week, we announced Ton Rutledge's plan of retirement, and that Eric Zinterhofer is reassuming the non-Executive Chairman role at Charter. I'm pleased that Tom will remain as Director Emeritus, and grateful to Tom, Eric and our full Board, including two of the most successful cable investors in Liberty Media and Advanced New House, for their work to achieve a smooth CEO transition for Charter. Jessica?\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 63,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. We estimate that approximately 15,000 third quarter Internet disconnects were driven by the temporary loss of ESPN in September.\nVideo customers declined by 327,000 in the third quarter, with about 100,000 video disconnects driven by the Disney programming dispute. The overall impact to customer relationships was less than we expected, facilitated in part by the wide availability of over-the-top alternative.\nThe loss of Disney programming occurred both at the beginning of football season and in the midst of a programming cost pass-through and the launch of our new AutoPay discount incentive on Internet. Nonetheless, operationally, we handled the Disney dispute very well. But our billing and retention call centers were not fully back to normal until early October, so there was lingering customer net add impact early in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to mobile. We added 594,000 mobile lines in the third quarter. Wireline voice customers declined by 286,000 in the third quarter. Overall market activity, churn gross adds, remained well below pre-COVID levels, partly driven by persistently low move rates. We continue to compete well in a portion of our footprint that is overlapped by fiber, but we also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the lower usage and price-sensitive customer segments of our residential and SMB businesses. That product remains slower and less reliable than what we can deliver, and will be additionally constrained as consumers demand more and more data.\nIn fact, high data usage customers that switched to fixed wireless have a higher propensity to return to our Internet service. Despite our Disney dispute, third quarter residential Internet churn was at a new record low for the third quarter.\nOur Spectrum Mobile product also continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers has continued to increase. [indiscernible] from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions grew year-over-year, despite much higher mobile sales. We also continue to see healthy data usage on our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines should perform well as long-term customers.\nIn the third quarter of last year, we launched Spectrum One pilot programs in a handful of markets. The pilot program customers reached their 12-month anniversary during the third quarter of this year, and incremental churn on those lines was small and even less than we expected.\nTurning to rural. Subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the third quarter, with 78,000 passings activated. And we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. As our RDOF build has progressed, we have identified roughly 300,000 adjacent passings along the way that are not in the sense of slot groups we want, but we will add to our network as we complete the RDOF build. Because of these adjacent passings, we now expect that our RDOF initiative will yield a total of 1.3 million passings to be constructed over a multiyear period.\nAnd while labor and equipment costs have both increased, we expect the average net cost per passing of these 1.3 million passings to be similar to our original RDOF net cost per passing estimate. We don't expect any potential BEAD build, subject to what Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet, partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.6% year-over-year, given a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base and $63 million of residential customer credits related to the Disney lockout, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year.\nAs Slide 6 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue grew by 0.3% year-over-year.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 1.3% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.5%.\nThird quarter advertising revenue declined by 20.3% or $97 million year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 1.8%, due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 28.8% year-over-year, driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year, and up 1.5% year-over-year when excluding advertising and the impact of the $68 million in total Disney-related customer credits.\nMoving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In the third quarter, total operating expenses were approximately flat year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 6% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages and a $61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in early September.\nThese factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. We now expect that for the full year 2023, programming cost per video customer will decline by approximately 3% year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 15.2%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower ad sales costs.\nCost to service customers increased by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by previous adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Those were partly offset by productivity improvements, including from 10-year investments, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. Sales and marketing costs declined by 1.4%, primarily driven by lower labor costs, as we've lapped our prior year employee investments in sales and marketing.\nOverall, while we certainly had some additional overtime in our call centers, given the Disney dispute, it was not a material expense driver this quarter. Finally, other expenses grew by 2.5%, driven by labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.7% year-over-year in the quarter.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, up from $1.2 billion last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower other operating expense, partly offset by higher interest expense.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $3 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $2.4 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on upgrade rebuild due to our network evolution initiative, higher spend on line extensions driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunities, and higher CPE, driven by the purchase of Xumo devices for our launch earlier this month.\nFor the full year 2023, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $11.2 billion. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, should total approximately $7.2 billion, higher than our previous expectation. The increase reflects additional Xumo CPE purchases and an acceleration of network spend related to future high split markets, including inventory accumulation and other preparation activities like walk-out and design and proactive equipment swap-outs of both DTAs and MPEG2 boxes.\nAs Chris noted, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve the network to offer multiple gigabit speeds. There has been no change to our longer-term network evolution CapEx outlook.\nWe also continue to expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to total approximately $4 billion. We are working through our 2024 operating plan right now. Given the greater subsidized rural passings and construction opportunity we currently see, we may partially fund that opportunity by very modestly slowing our network evolution plan, as Chris mentioned. And as we complete our 2024 plans, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter 2023 call in January.\nI want to highlight that capital expenditures, excluding line extensions and network evolution as a percentage of total revenue, have remained consistent since 2021. And following the completion of our network evolution initiative, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications.\nAs Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow this quarter versus $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx, mostly driven by our network evolution and expansion initiatives.\nA couple of brief comments on working capital and cash taxes before turning to the balance sheet. Excluding the impact of mobile devices, we now expect our full year 2023 change in working capital to be negative by a few hundred million dollars, given the timing of capital expenditures and lower-than-expected accrued programming at year-end.\nOn cash taxes, we did have a lower cash tax payment in the third quarter, which is just a timing difference. The full year cash tax outlook, which I provided during our fourth quarter 2022 call, still stand.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. At of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 2 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $854 million, at an average price of $421 per share. Our 2023 EBITDA growth has been pressured by significant investments we've made in the future growth of our business. As we move toward 2024, pressure on our EBITDA growth will begin to abate, with growing transaction efficiency as we benefit from building employee tenure and easier comps as we have now lapped the impact of those employee investments.\nLower transactions in our mobile business, which drove down -- which drive down our per customer cost of service and building as we move into next year, revenue growth acceleration from the roll-off of our mobile free line offers and positive impact from political advertising. In addition, faster pacing of our rural build should bring additional positive impact to customer net additions next year.\nIn the longer term, the competitive impact in operational efficiencies from our network evolution will drive a stronger broadband business. Convergence momentum will improve our churn and generate financial growth for both broadband and mobile, and transformational changes to the video business can enhance the value of our product for our connectivity customers. The investments we have been making and will continue to make are set to drive the growth of our business going forward.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's Second Quarter 2023 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we added 77,000 Internet customers, and we continue to benefit from our Spectrum One offering and our network expansion initiatives. We also added 648,000 Spectrum Mobile lines. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 6.6 million total mobile lines. Over 11% of our Internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years. Spectrum Mobile is the nation's fastest mobile service. We see mobile lines as an extension of our WiFi and seamless connectivity service. And we expect our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to further Internet growth.\nWe're pleased with the progress of our growth initiatives and our performance in the second quarter, and we maintained EBITDA despite the significant employee investments we made through 2022, which will start generating growth benefits later this year. We remain focused on our three key strategic initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution, each of which is designed to help us grow our business and each of which remains very much on plan. Our network evolution plan is progressing well and offers us significant benefits. First, it will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of our customers and competitors ever where we operate. with symmetrical and multi-gig speeds via DOCSIS 4.0 and the ability to provide 25, 50 or even 100 gigabit per second speeds with fiber on demand.\nThis evolution path also creates follow upstream and downstream capacity for years, driving lower node [indiscernible] capital. And by upgrading the actives and amplifiers and nodes and converting analog optics to digital, we lower our future operating and maintenance expenses, all at a very low cost, much of which is funded from capital and operating cost savings over time. Unlike telco companies who prioritize more attractive footprints for their upgrades, our deployment is across our entire footprint. The cable industry is nearly ubiquitous deployment of a tremendous amount of spectrum to each home will provide the scale platform for software and product developers to create new bandwidth-intensive, low latency, high compute services.\nThis uniform deployment of network capabilities is what cable has always done to lead the development of new technologies into our networks at scale. And that unique approach is what has and will maintain our competitiveness into the future. So our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter. So far, the execution of this large physical upgrade has gone well, and capital costs are coming in on target. Excluding the benefit of any network savings, we continue to expect to spend $100 per passing. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve. Spectrum One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like mobile speed boost and Spectrum Mobile network, each of which run on our advanced WiFi product.\nToday, over 45% of our Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, and over 75% of our mobile customers now attached to the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes, providing higher speeds with more reliability to customers with lower cost to Charter. Spectrum One also offers significant payments for customers with market-leading pricing at both, promotion and retail. We're excited for the upcoming release of the Zumo product, which I believe will be an industry-leading platform for customers to access all of their linear and DTC video content with unified search and discovery. Together with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the U.S., Zumo will be our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're currently conducting field trials in the product, and we remain on track for deployment later this year.\nOur expansion initiative with subsidized rural construction is also on plan. penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better pace than planned. Charter is the largest and fastest-growing rural provider in the nation. Our scale and reputation as a rural builder positions us well for winning additional state and local funds, and we hope significant bead infrastructure funding. Although the rules and recommendations from NTIA on bead funding differ from successful programs currently deployed by the states in which we operate, we'll work with key stakeholders and government officials to reach a place where the rules are still conducive to private investment. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and satisfaction, driving faster customer growth.\nWe continue to see the benefits of our investments in training and tenure, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our customer service platforms will further reduce transactions. There's been a lot of discussion about what artificial intelligence and machine learning could do to improve products and business models. Charter already uses advanced analytics and machine learning in various stages and forms across sales, service and network operations. And we expect to continue our investments in AI, machine learning and digital service in ways that meet customers where and how they want to receive service and continually enhance tools for our sales and service employees to simplify their jobs.\nUltimately, AI will improve both, customer and employee satisfaction, and enhance our operating efficiency by driving fewer physical service transactions, lower cost and lower churn for years to come. Our operating strategy is focused on running our business for long-term value creation for our shareholders, which includes two of the cable industries most successful investors. Simply put, our operating strategy is founded on having great products, pricing and packaging that creates value for customers and is very difficult for competitors to replicate, so that we get more products into each household and drive more penetration across the network, which lowers our cost to serve. And then combine that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers.\nWe have a great team here at Charter. And we're committed to disciplined execution and investment in this operating strategy, which we believe is good for customers, employees and the communities we serve and will drive significant long-term value creation for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we added 77,000 Internet customers in the second quarter, versus 38,000 in the prior year period when excluding last year's Internet disconnects related to the transition from EBB to ACP. Video customers in the second quarter declined by 200,000, wireline voice declined by 221,000, and we added 648,000 mobile lines. Internet churn remained near record lows for the second quarter and flat year-over-year and Internet gross additions improved year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in Internet net additions was driven by tailwinds from our rural construction initiative, the continued success of our Spectrum One product, better sales yields from higher tenured employees, and a slower pace of fiber overbuild in our footprint during the quarter.\nDespite the year-over-year improvement in net adds, overall market activity remains well below pre-COVID level, partly driven by very low move rates. We also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segments of residential and SMB. As Chris mentioned, our Spectrum Mobile products continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers continued to increase and was higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Port-ins from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions are essentially the same today as they were prior to the launch of Spectrum One despite much higher mobile sales. And with good usage on those promotional lines and unbeatable quality and value at a $30 retail price point, we expect the lines to perform well as long-term customers.\nTurning to rural. Subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the quarter with 68,000 passings activated. And we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. Additionally, costs are coming in as planned and we have the labor, equipment and supply necessary to execute our build. We continue to bid on additional subsidies. In addition to RDOF, we've now won over $700 million in state subsidies for over 300,000 passings with a gross build cost of approximately $1.7 billion. and a per passing cost to Charter net of subsidies of approximately $3,200. As Chris mentioned, we also look forward to the bed bidding process, assuming the right regulatory conditions.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 7. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.3% year-over-year given a higher mix of nonvideo customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. As Slide 7 shows, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 0.2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 1.7%, partly offset by lower monthly SMB revenue per customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 6.2% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.2%. Second quarter advertising revenue declined by 16.5% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core advertising revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew 28.5% year-over-year driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.5% year-over-year and up 1.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising.\nMoving to operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $48 million or 0.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 7.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.1% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates in the second half of -- by higher programming rates. In the second half of 2023, we now expect year-over-year growth in programming cost per video customer to be similar to the growth we saw in the first half of 2023. Other cost of revenue increased by 15.4%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales, other mobile direct costs and higher RSN costs driven by more Lakers games partly offset by lower ad sales costs.\nCost to service customers increased by 3.6% year-over-year, driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile, which was partly offset by productivity improvements, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. As we mentioned last quarter, our employee attrition has declined more quickly than we expected given the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting. In response, we lowered our normal hiring in the first half of this year, and our overall headcount is now normalizing with increasing overall tenure and quality.\nLonger term, we continue to expect to see additional efficiencies in cost to service customers as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance and network evolution investments. Sales and marketing costs grew by 3.6%, primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. And other expenses declined by 0.4%, driven by favorability in insurance expense, mostly offset by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.2% year-over-year in the quarter.\nTurning to net income on Slide 9. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, down from $1.5 billion last year, with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by additional interest expense.\nTurning to Slide 10. Capital expenditures totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter, above last year's second quarter spend of $2.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $693 million in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in line extension was driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunities. Second quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe spent more on upgrade rebuild primarily due to our network evolution initiative, and support capital was higher primarily due to investments in information technology systems. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion.\nWe continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending, including [ Beaton. ] As Slide 11 shows, we generated $668 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was driven by higher CapEx, mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and higher cash taxes as we became a full federal cash taxpayer in 2023.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. And as of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $400 million at an average price of $341 per share. While our goal is to grow the business in the long term, our focus on execution is driving operating leverage in the business even now. When you take the noise from political ads -- when you take out the noise from political advertising, EBITDA grew by 1.3% year-over-year in the quarter, which means that we were more efficient despite significant mobile growth and a onetime step-up in labor investments.\nAnd we believe our financials will improve as we move later into the year with additional revenue growth in Internet and mobile that will begin showing in Q4 and lower service cost per customer as we realize the 10-year benefits of our investment in employees and lap last year's labor step up. Longer term, we also expect to see continuing benefits in operating expenses from further digitization, network improvements, and benefits of programs like proactive maintenance. We're well poised for the future. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anniger. Please go ahead.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's First Quarter 2023 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning -- predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. During the first quarter, we added 76,000 Internet customers with contributions from our Spectrum One offering and our rural construction initiative. We continue to operate in a low transaction environment, and yet we added 686,000 Spectrum Mobile lines. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6 million total mobile lines. Just over 10% of our Internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years, and our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to Internet growth. .\nWe grew revenue and EBITDA by 3.4% and 2.6%, respectively, during the first quarter, and our capital expenditures reflect progress on our key initiatives. This is a very unique time for the cable industry with generational opportunities across our 3 key initiatives, each of which is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth.\nThe first initiative is evolution, which includes the most significant spectrum enhancement to the cable network since the late 1990s at a very low cost. Network evolution also includes the convergence of our connectivity products. Second is the largest expansion of our footprint since the 1980s, bringing broadband to unserved and underserved areas. And finally, execution, which is all about investing in and delivering great service. I'll provide a brief update on these initiatives.\nOur network evolution plan is progressing well. We have now completed the physical work for high split in 2 midsized markets. We increased the network capacity to 1.2 gigahertz and which is equivalent to the acquisition of 400 megahertz of spectrum. We also allocated more spectrum for upstream use. In these markets, we're now capable of delivering 2 x 1 gigabit per second service, and we're launching the same CMTS based 1.2 gigahertz high split to an additional 6 markets. These DMAs represent about 15% of our footprint. In parallel, we're preparing the second step of our network evolution plan, which will cover about 50% of our footprint and which adds the deployment of distributed access architecture, allowing us to deliver 5 x 1 gigabit per second speeds.\nStep 3 of our network evolution plan covers about 35% of our footprint and should begin in late 2024. That step adds a further expansion of our network to 1.8 gigahertz. We expect our network evolution initiative will be essentially complete by the end of 2025 at the previously noted $100 per passing target, excluding the benefit of any network savings, which will come.\nOur converged product offering also continues to evolve SPECTRUM One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and spoke Spectrum Mobile network each of which run on our advanced WiFi product. Today, over 40% of our residential Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, which just last month, we also launched to the SMB marketplace. Over 70% of our customers or mobile customers now use the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes.\nSpectrum One also offers significant savings for customers in both promotional and retail pricing. So our opportunity in converged connectivity in mobile is very large. We particularly like our ability to mix the lease economics of our 5G MVNO for the 10% to 15% of the time that our mobile customers don't have access to our faster Spectrum Mobile network. We have a strategic partner in Verizon, and we're a meaningful contributor to active lines on its network and its financials.\nAnd when we look at the pricing and the usage of fixed wireless access disclosed by T-Mobile, it's clear that the MVNO price we pay per gigabyte is dramatically better than the economics mobile operators achieve with fixed wireless access offerings. In the expansion category, our plans are on track. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings. Subsidized rural passings growth is accelerating with 20,000 subsidized rural passings activated in March. Costs are coming in as planned, and we have the labor, the equipment and the supply necessary to execute our build.\nIf we get the fll permit support we need, we can complete our RDOF commitments 2 years ahead of the RDOF deadline. The pace of penetration gains in subsidized rule passings continues to exceed our expectations with 6-month penetrations at approximately 40%. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and customer satisfaction, ultimately driving faster customer growth. Our proactive maintenance efforts are fundamentally changing the customer experience. And using telemetry, we can address service impairments before customers even know they exist, pulling forward service calls that otherwise would have occurred and preventing service-related disconnects. We expect the mix of proactive truck rolls will increase significantly in the coming years.\nWe're also seeing the benefits of our investments in training and tenure faster than expected. Employee retention among our frontline service employees during the first quarter was the best I've ever seen. And while investments in our employees generate upfront expense, they ultimately deliver longer tenured employees, which produce higher-quality transactions, fewer repeat transactions, lower average handle times and better sales yields. So increasing tenure also allows for a greater amount of our network evolution project to be performed with our own employees, which will save money and increase the quality of the upgrade.\nAdditionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms, where we've invested significantly in machine learning and the precursors to AI, will further reduce transactions. More to come on that in the future quarters, but the key point here is that the combination of longer employee tenure, network evolution benefits, the conversion of our video platform to IP and digital service investments all create a long runway for us to continue to reduce service transactions, operating cost and churn, which increases customer satisfaction, customer lifetime value and our returns.\nSo ultimately, we're focused on doing everything that a customer would want us to do, investing in the network to offer even faster speeds, providing seamless connectivity products not available elsewhere, then bringing that same seamless connectivity to markets that have never had broadband before and delivering better customer service by investing in digital service platforms and a more tenured, more qualified service employee, all while helping save customers significant money in an inflationary environment.\nSo our strategy is focused on delivering differentiated converged connectivity products that essentially improves people's lives and creates value for shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to remind everyone that starting this quarter, we've made some changes to the way we report our P&L. First, we now include mobile service revenue in the residential and SMB revenue as appropriate, and mobile equipment revenue is now reported in other revenue.\nOn the expense side, we no longer report mobile expenses separately, and those are now included in the applicable expense category. Ultimately, these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and offer structure. For additional information regarding these changes, please review footnote A on Page 7 of the trending schedule we posted this morning.\nNow let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 76,000 Internet customers in the first quarter. Video customers declined by $241,000 partly driven by a programming expense increase passed through in January of this year. Wireline voice declined by 220,000, and we added a record 686,000 mobile lines.\nAlthough our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the first quarter, market activity levels remain low. During the quarter, total churn was slightly higher than last year, but still near record lows and well below pre-pandemic levels. We've seen a small impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segment. Generally speaking, however, these customers typically exhibit higher levels of churn regardless of competition. And given the issues with fixed wireless product feeds, as confirmed by third parties, and questions surrounding that product's reliability and scalability, we expect fixed wireless customers to find their way back to us over time.\nWe continue to drive very strong mobile growth with our high-quality, differentiated and attractively priced service. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from acquisition has increased significantly since the introduction of our Spectrum One product. And as we mentioned last quarter, our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn.\nAs Chris mentioned, we also continue to perform well in rural areas. The new rural disclosures we issued today on Page 5 of our trending schedule show that we continue to see robust growth in rural passings. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings despite winter's construction seasonality. Penetration of subsidized rural passings continues to exceed our original target, and these rural customers are purchasing products beyond Internet, including mobile, video and wireline voice.\nMoving to financial results starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers were down slightly with new customer growth driven by Internet offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.5% with promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by a higher mix of nonvideo customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nAs Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 2.5% year-over-year. And as a reminder, starting this quarter, our residential revenue now includes mobile service revenue, which grew from $387 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $497 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 2.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.1% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.3%.\nFirst quarter advertising revenue declined by 7.2% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 2.1% year-over-year driven by lower local and national advertising revenue, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 34% year-over-year primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher rural subsidies. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 3.4% year-over-year. Looking to second quarter revenue growth. I would remind you that we will lap April 22 rate adjustments and face the headwind of strong political advertising revenue in the prior year.\nMoving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $316 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages partly offset by higher programming rates. Note that our first quarter programming costs included $50 million of favorable adjustments, which is similar in size to sports network rebates and other favorable adjustments we saw in the first quarter last year.\nLooking at the full year 2023, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 19.9% primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs. Cost to service customers increased by 6.9% year-over-year driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer-tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile.\nPartly offset by productivity improvements, as a result of the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting, our employee attrition declined more quickly than we had expected, which is allowing us to lower our normal hiring in the first half of this year and increase overall tenure and quality. Longer term, we continue to expect additional efficiencies and cost to service customers over time as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance and network evolution investments.\nSales and marketing costs grew by 7.6% primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. And other expenses grew by 6.7% driven by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter down from $1.2 billion last year with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by higher interest expense.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion in the first quarter, above last year's first quarter spend of $1.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $890 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $541 million in the prior quarter driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities.\nI would also note that in the first quarter, we saw a sequential decline in total CapEx associated with our subsidized rural construction initiative as we purchased a significant amount of rural construction equipment inventory as supply chain issues improved in the fourth quarter. First quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We spent more on upgrade rebuild given our network evolution initiative. Customer premise equipment, which includes installation costs, was higher year-over-year, and support capital was also up just given timing.\nOur expectations for full year 2023 capital expenditures have not changed, in part because the costs associated with our network evolution and rural construction initiatives are coming in as planned. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension and capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion.\nWe continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume that we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending.\nAs Slide 10 shows, we generated $664 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.8 billion in the first quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and an unfavorable change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices, which was typical seasonality for the first quarter but larger than last year. The year-over-year headwind was partly driven by outgoing payments related to the larger inventory buildup in Q4 of 2022 that I just mentioned.\nFor the full year, however, we expect the change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices to be roughly neutral as our capital and payroll accruals should rise over the course of the year. Mobile device working capital will remain a headwind given the mismatch in timing between when we receive EIP payments and when we pay handset providers.\nAlso, in the first quarter, we didn't make significant cash tax payments. And generally speaking, we make 4 federal cash tax payments a year with 2 quarterly payments made in the second quarter and 1 payment made in each of the third and fourth quarters. We're not changing our cash tax outlook that we provided on last quarter's call and simply providing a bit more clarity on the timing of cash tax payments.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1 billion at an average price of $375 per share. Charter's bandwidth ridge 2-way network passes nearly 56 million homes and businesses with gigabit and converged services everywhere. And given the significant investments we've made in that network over a multiyear period, we're now in a position to upgrade it further in both a cost-efficient and time-efficient manner to offer the fastest speeds and the most advanced telecommunication services in the country.\nAdditionally, our scale and our capabilities are allowing us to rapidly expand that network, both to unserved and underserved areas through our rural construction initiative and to other high ROI expansion opportunities. Those initiatives, combined with our service-oriented operating strategy and prudent capital allocation, are poised to drive long-term customer growth, higher free cash flow and shareholder value.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Sir, please begin.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVP of IR, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2022 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.\nBefore we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO.\nWith that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nPresident & CEO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stefan. We continued to execute well within a challenging market backdrop in 2022, we remain excited about the industry's future and Charter's in particular. We added over 340,000 Internet customers in 2022 despite the previous pandemic pull forward and a low activity environment.\nWe also continued to see very strong mobile line growth with full year line net additions of over 1.7 million. As of the end of 2022, we had 5.3 million total mobile lines. So we're growing mobile lines fast even in a low-volume environment by saving customers hundreds and often thousands of dollars per year. That growth creates value for Charter and supports broadband growth.\nFor the full year, we grew our consolidated revenue by 4.5% and our adjusted EBITDA by close to 5%. The planned December management transition with Tom moving to Executive Chairman is also going very well, and I'm pleased Tom will join us in today's Q&A.\nIn 2023 and the coming years, we remain primarily focused on 3 broadband initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution. Each of these initiatives is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth.\nStarting with evolution. Already in 2023 and over the next 3 years, we will evolve our network to ubiquitously offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds. We'll deploy these new speed offerings at a much faster pace and at much cheaper cost than our competitors, just $100 per passing. And we'll maintain our marketing speed claims.\nWe're also evolving our go-to-market approach with increasing convergence. We recently launched Spectrum One, which combines our Internet, Advanced WiFi and mobile products for the fastest, seamless connectivity. During the fourth quarter, we saw continued sell-in of mobile to our large Internet base, and our Spectrum One converged offering helped drive our strongest quarter yet for mobile lines.\nThe potential for mobile to be a significant driver of new Internet sales is still largely untapped as we educate nonsubscribers of the Spectrum One value proposition. With nearly 5.3 million lines created over a 4-year period, it is clear that our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn. And while some of that churn benefit may be self-selection, mobile drives better churn and, ultimately, acquisitions for Charter.\nOur second area of focus is the expansion of our footprint. Line extension construction is an important part of our 2023 growth plan and beyond and offers good growth and returns visibility. We hope to complete our RDOF build ahead of the original commitment and that faster completion is good for our returns, the communities where we build, obviously, and it creates credibility for future subsidized builds and option value for future growth.\nAs we also mentioned in December, we've been successful in winning a number of other state and local grants in 2022 and expect the same in 2023. And we expect, assuming a reasonable regulatory framework, to participate in the $42.5 billion BEAD program.\nThe initial results of our rural construction initiative had been very promising. We constructed over 200,000 new rural passings in 2022, and penetration of passings open at least 6 months is ahead of our expectations at about 40%. Over time, we expect our rural construction initiative to be a significant contributor to our customer growth with attractive mid- to high-teen internal rates of return.\nAnd finally, we remain focused on executing on our core operating strategy, all to further improve customer experience, raise customer satisfaction and drive customer growth. We're doing that in a number of ways, including the continued digitization of our customer service model in ways that enhance the customer experience; accelerating our proactive maintenance initiative to address service issues before customers even see an impairment; and investing in training and tenure for our employees to continue to improve our service and sales capabilities.\nLonger tenure leads to better execution with higher sales, lower service transactions, lower churn and more products per customer over time. So we have a large growth opportunity in front of us through network evolution, convergence and continued operational execution and a very unique opportunity to expand our footprint.\nWe have a successful operating model to address the opportunities in front of us. It's the same strategy that we've deployed for years. It's about having the fastest connectivity and products and pricing and packaging that's difficult for customers to replicate and putting that all together so that we provide more product into the household, more penetration across our passings and then marrying that with high-quality service with fewer service transactions and lower churn. That all drives higher long-term recurring cash flow.\nWe then take that sustainable cash flow model and put it together with an innovative capital structure and a disciplined approach to ROI-driven capital allocation between organic investment, expansion and/or M&A and buybacks, and you get Charter. So we have a great path in front of us to deliver long-term shareholder value creation, which means delivering for our customers, employees and local communities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Before getting started, I want to remind you that we will be making a couple of changes to our reporting beginning next quarter.\nFirst, as we noted in our investor meeting in December, we'll include mobile service revenue and residential and SMB revenue as appropriate. We will no longer report mobile expenses separately, and both of these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and our offer structure.\nSecond, we will provide additional line extension capital and rural disclosures. And finally, I want to note that while our fourth quarter results contain some modest impacts from Hurricane Ian, the overall impact of the hurricane on our financials and customer numbers was very small and doesn't warrant separate disclosure.\nLet's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 105,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter and added 344,000 over the last 12 months. Video customers declined by 144,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 233,000, and we added a record 615,000 mobile lines. For the full year, we added 1.7 million mobile lines.\nAlthough our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the fourth quarter, activity levels remain low. During the quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total churn, voluntary churn and non-paid churn were all lower year-over-year, and we're at all-time lows for the fourth quarter.\n[Move] return remains well below pre-pandemic levels, which also reduces our selling opportunities. Gross additions remain down across the footprint by similar amounts in overbuild and non-overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters.\nIn terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless, instead of coming to us. But given the issues with fixed wireless, product reliability and scalability, we expect those customers to find their way to us over the long term.\nIn addition, we've seen a slightly higher pace of fiber overbuild recently. And I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects.\nDespite these challenges with lower market activity, our Spectrum One product is working. We remain in the early stages of offering converged packages of products and refinement to our approach continues, but we're very pleased with the results.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nAlso keep in mind that our residential revenue and ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue, although that will change next quarter when we make the reporting adjustments I discussed a moment ago. In addition, we're allocating a portion of Spectrum One-related customer revenue from Internet to mobile revenue under GAAP. As Slide 6 shows, total residential revenue grew by 0.4% year-over-year.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2.4% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9.1%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.4% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was down by 3% with lower national and local advertising revenue, driven by the softening ad market, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nMobile revenue totaled $876 million, with $401 million of that revenue being device revenue. And other revenue grew by 4.9% year-over-year, mostly driven by higher rural construction initiative subsidies, partly offset by lower processing fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year and up 4.5% for the full year 2022.\nMoving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $359 million or 4.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.3% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2023, we expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year.\nRegulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 5.3%, primarily driven by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. Cost to service customers increased by 5.8% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs, higher fuel and freight costs and higher bad debt, partly offset by productivity improvements. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 4.9%. And while bad debt was higher year-over-year, it remained below pre-COVID level.\nAs we noted in our December investor meeting, we're making very targeted adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits and career paths inside of our operations teams in order to build an even higher skilled and more tenured workforce, which drove the higher labor costs.\nThese adjustments will add some pressure year-over-year to cost to service customers expense growth in the first half of this year. But that year-over-year growth should moderate in the second half of 2023. And we continue to expect additional efficiencies in cost to service customers over time as a result of the continued digitization of service, productivity improvements and our network evolution investments.\nMarketing expense grew by 6.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the higher staffing levels I mentioned and wages, which included targeted adjustments in our sales channels. Mobile expenses totaled $982 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs.\nAnd other expenses increased by 6.6%, primarily driven by higher labor costs and higher advertising sales expense related to higher political revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.9% year-over-year in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year 2022.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter compared to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, with higher income tax and interest expense more than offsetting higher adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year 2022. Our total CapEx for the year reflects the timing of more accelerated equipment inventory receipts in December than expected.\nFourth quarter capital spending of $2.9 billion rose above last year's fourth quarter spend of $2.1 billion, primarily driven by higher line extension spend driven by our rural construction initiative. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, increased from $1.6 billion in last year's fourth quarter to $2 billion this quarter, driven by investment in network evolution, higher customer premise equipment spend on Advanced WiFi equipment and timing of spend.\nFor the full year 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. So excluding line extensions, we expect a small increase year-over-year in capital spend driven by the acceleration of network evolution spending and partly offset by declines in other areas.\nFollowing the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter.\nTurning to line extensions. In 2023, we expect line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending.\nWe also expect most BEAD money to begin to be appropriated in the 2024 time frame with 4-year build time lines from grants. At that time, we expect that our RDOF spend will begin to ramp down. We expect the BEAD program to present a unique and attractive opportunity for us to expand our network with subsidies, generating significant returns that solidly exceed our cost of capital.\nFor our additional subsidized passings, we expect our net rural construction cost per passing to be closer to the roughly $3,000 per passing that we've incurred in our recent subsidized state and local builds than to our RDOF per passing costs. Our 6-month penetration of passings in our newly built rural areas continues to be around 40%, and we expect penetrations in these areas to continue to grow.\nIf you use the cost per passing that I mentioned a moment ago, a high broadband penetration assumption, which we think is reasonable, our current ARPU, excluding mobile, a high incremental margin based on low incremental overhead costs and a reasonable terminal multiple or perpetuity growth rate, you can clearly see the very attractive IRRs associated with our rural builds.\nTurning to Slide 10. We generated $1.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, mostly the result of our rural construction initiative and by higher cash tax payments.\nFor the full year, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow versus $8.7 billion in 2021. However, excluding cash taxes and our rural construction initiative, our full year free cash flow grew by 4%.\nWe finished the quarter with $97.4 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1.3 billion at an average price of $344 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 23.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling approximately $11.7 billion.\nWe have a proven operating, balance sheet and capital allocation model that drives customer and financial growth and shareholder value. We've always prioritized investments that generate long-term growth, and those investments ultimately protect and extend our return of capital to shareholders. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and intend to both invest for long-term growth and simultaneously return excess capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions)\nAlso as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVP of IR, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's Third Quarter 2022 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.\nBefore we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nPlease also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas M. Rutledge\n\nChairman & CEO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stefan. As I look at our current advanced offerings, our future product plans and the underpenetration of our network, we're well-positioned to grow our business at very attractive rates for many years to come.\nDuring the quarter, we added 75,000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains very low due to current consumer behavior. And while the lower year-over-year connect activity improved, connects remain challenged due to low activity environment. We continue to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 396,000, our best quarter yet. Over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50% and as of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 4.7 million total mobile lines.\nOur opportunity in mobile is very large, and we're still at the beginning of developing that business. Today, we only captured 28% of the combined household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So we remain significantly underpenetrated versus the opportunity in front of us. And we're delivering the fastest Internet and the fastest WiFi speeds in the nation and the fastest mobile speeds when combined with WiFi, all the while serving -- saving customers, I should say, thousands of dollars a year. Today, we have close to 500 million devices connected to our network, the vast majority of which are connected to us wirelessly.\nUltimately, I expect that virtually all devices connected to our network will connect wirelessly. To continue to improve our services, we also remain focused on evolving our network to offer the fastest speeds in the most cost and time-efficient manner. Data usage continues to grow at a fast pace. Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 700 gigabytes per month.\nNearly 25% of those customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. And downstream traffic still dominates usage at a ratio of 14:1 versus upstream traffic. In the near term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity bidirectionally and allow us to allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure.\nIn turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Our network evolution path also includes DOCSIS 4.0, so we can maintain a state-of-the-art network that delivers the most compelling converged connectivity services in a capital and time-efficient manner, and in turn, offer those advanced services to consumers at highly attractive prices.\nAs you may know, I plan to step down as CEO on December 1. That time, Chris Winfrey will become our new CEO and I will become Executive Chairman. It's been personally fulfilling to lead Charter over the last 10 years. We've grown our company through innovation and strategic investments that position Charter to provide the best connectivity products and services available today everywhere we operate.\nOur products have continually evolved and changed the world during my career, from the carriage of broadcast signals when I began to the development of robust video and multichannel cable networks. And from the early days of broadband, Internet and voice, to now offering fully ubiquitous wireless connectivity, we continue to drive new uses for our networks to bring value to consumers and our opportunity to innovate and grow is greater today than ever before.\nHaving worked closely with Chris for more than 10 years, I know that he's the right choice to be our next CEO. He will serve Charter with both vision and skill leading the company to new heights. Chris' leadership and expertise in both operations and finance have been pivotal to Charter's growth and success over the past 10 years. He's repeatedly demonstrated in a strategic insight in key market and industry awareness to drive our organization to perform at the highest levels. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher L. Winfrey\n\nCOO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thanks for the kind words. I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to continue to help Charter grow and to create shareholder value as the incoming CEO.\nIt has also been a privilege for all of us here at Charter to work for and learn from Tom over the past 10 years. His leadership is the reason Charter exists as it does today, and he's mentored all of us here to keep reinventing cable and we're fortunate that he'll continue to do the same as our Executive Chairman.\nSo Tom covered the quarterly headlines. So I thought I'd give some additional market color. While our Internet net additions improved from last quarter, they remained below last year. The largest driver by far is that activity level remains low. Total churn and voluntary churn were slightly lower year-over-year and were at all-time lows for third quarter. Non-pay and move churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Those are market issues that also reduce our selling opportunities.\nWhile we've seen some improving trends, gross additions also remained down across the footprint by similar amounts in both overbuild and non overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. In terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless instead of coming to us. Given the issues with fixed wireless product reliability and scalability and usage trends, we expect those customers to find their way back to us over the long term.\nWe've also seen a similar pace of fiber overbuild, but the reported telco Internet numbers confirm what we saw, a small mix issue from newly overbuilt footprint, no different from the past. I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects.\nSo we're in a unique moment, the opposite of the one we saw in 2020 and early 2021, in fact. Market transaction volume will eventually pick up and so will our Internet net adds. In the meantime, we're growing mobile at record rates, even in a low volume environment by saving customers thousands of dollars. That growth is also good for broadband.\nSo we remain well-positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband services continue to converge technically and operationally, and our Spectrum One offering launched earlier this month exemplifies that.\nAs Tom mentioned, we have a path to drive significantly higher speeds at a much faster pace and at much lower cost than our competitors. And we can sustain good revenue growth, lower cost of service per customer relationship for many years.\nI've been in the cable industry for almost 25 years and at Charter for over 10 years. And I've played a key role in developing our operating strategy. So our recipe for creating shareholder value through better products, pricing and packaging and service, coupled with a levered equity return strategy, will remain intact.\nAt the same time, I do think the CEO transition will be a good opportunity for us, both in this market and with the transition taking place to update investors on what I expect over the next few years, including details of our network evolution plan, convergence capabilities, service experience for customers and our rural expansion and build-out plans. That's a lot to cover, so I look forward to a virtual event with the investment community that we'll schedule for a date, following the CEO transition in December.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to mention that today's results do not include any impact related to Hurricane Ian, which hit the East Coast in late September. Initially, approximately 1 million of our customers lost service, primarily because of power outages, but our crews worked hard to repair our network and reconnect customers, and they did a great job.\nBroadly speaking, our plant fared well despite the storm and service was restored to nearly all impacted customers in a relatively short period of time. And while we expect our fourth quarter results to contain some bill credits, some incremental CapEx related to plant replacement and some incremental operating expense related to store cleanup and call center labor, we expect the overall impact of Hurricane Ian on our financials and customer numbers will be very small.\nLet's turn to customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 75,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. Video customers declined by $204,000 in the third quarter, following a programming pass-through increase in the second quarter. Wireline and voice declined by 271,000 and we added a record 396,000 mobile lines despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels. We continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service. Looking forward, we expect our new Spectrum One offer to drive accelerating mobile line growth.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by $123,000 or 0.4% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of nonvideo customers, higher expanded basic video losses in the last several quarters and accelerated growth of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nOur year-over-year residential revenue per customer relationship growth was lower this quarter than last, given the timing of rate adjustments in this year versus last and the mix factors I just mentioned. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 0.7% year-over-year.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.9% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.6% year-over-year or by 5.2% year-over-year when excluding some onetime fees from the prior period, which were a benefit last year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9% and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year.\nThird quarter advertising revenue grew by 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was flat year-over-year with lower national and local advertising revenue, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nMobile revenue totaled $750 million with $303 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 2.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers, mostly offset by rural construction initiatives subsidies. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 3.1% year-over-year.\nMoving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q3, total operating expenses grew by $278 million or 3.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates.\nLooking at the full year 2022. We now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low single-digit percentage range. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined 7.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers. For the full year 2022, we now expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range.\nCosts to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt from both years, costs to service customers grew by 3%, primarily due to higher fuel and freight costs, partly offset by productivity improvements.\nAnd while bad debt and nonpay churn were higher year-over-year, both remain well below pre-COVID levels. We now expect costs to service customers expense growth for the second half of 2022 to be more consistent with growth in the first half of 2022.\nMarketing expenses grew by 9.3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher staffing levels and wages as Charter focuses on providing better service to new and existing customers.\nFor the full year 2022, we now expect marketing expense to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. Mobile expenses totaled $846 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 4.4%, primarily driven by higher labor costs, higher advertising sales expense related to political revenue and higher computer and software expense, partly offset by lower corporate costs this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year in the quarter.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, essentially flat with last year with higher adjusted EBITDA, offset by higher interest expense.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $1.9 billion. Most of that increase was driven by $525 million of spend on our rural construction initiative in the quarter, and the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions.\nIn rural, we've accelerated our walkout and design nationally to allow for additional time for the process of securing full access. In addition, our access to inventory is improving, so we're carrying a more appropriate amount of inventory to support the [build]. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year on the rural construction initiative.\nWe spent $96 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back office systems. Core cable CapEx, which excludes our rural and mobile CapEx, increased from $1.7 billion last year to $1.8 billion this quarter, driven by modestly higher CPE and scalable infrastructure spending. We continue to expect core cable capital expenditures to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion for the full year 2022.\nAs Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx, mostly driven by our rural construction initiative.\nExcluding cash taxes, our rural construction initiative and litigation settlements, free cash flow grew by 5% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $96.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.8 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.48x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $445 per share.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas M. Rutledge\n\nChairman & CEO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stefan. Our business continues to grow despite an unusual macroeconomic environment. During the second quarter, we added 38,000 Internet customers when excluding an unfavorable impact related to the discontinuation of the emergency broadband benefit, EBB, program and additional definitional requirements of the affordable connectivity program. Customer relationship churn remains historically low due to current consumer behavior, and connect activity remains low primarily due to the low activity environment. At the same time, we continue to see very strong mobile line growth with line net additions of approximately 350,000. And over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4.3 million total mobile lines.\nFinancials were also strong in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue grew by 6.2%, and EBITDA grew by 9.7%. Looking forward, we remain well positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband service continues to converge technically and operationally. We offer them along with all of our other high-quality products at attractive prices. Our growth is driven by offering value-rich packages that differentiate us from our competition at prices customers can afford regardless of the economic environment. And we plan to continue to do that.\nTo continue to improve our service, we are focused on evolving our network. Data usage continues to grow at a very fast pace. During the second quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 650 gigabytes per month. Nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. And even with the rise of work from home, peak usage patterns still prevail with the vast majority of data usage occurring during the evening hours. Our network is built to handle that peak demand and delivers consistent speeds regardless of the time of day.\nWith our dense HFC network, we delivered gigabit speeds today everywhere we offer service. And in the near term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity and allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream.\nOur long-term network evolution path includes DOCSIS 4.0. Recent testing using DOCSIS 4.0 technology simultaneously delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream in a 4 amplifier cascade to a single modem.\nWe will develop this technology even further, but the test demonstrated that we can successfully drive bidirectional multi-gigabit speed offerings across our entire network in a very capital-efficient manner and without the major disruption to our customers and operations that other kinds of upgrades require. So we can deliver a future-proof network that delivers the most compelling connectivity services in capital and time-efficient manner and, in turn, offer those services to consumers at highly attractive prices.\nBut we're not only working to improve speeds and latency in our network. We're also working to improve network quality and reliability, reducing service transactions, driving longer customer lives and reducing churn. We're doing that through better maintenance practices, using artificial intelligence, telemetry and machine learning technologies to drive what we call operational intelligence. We're now able to ingest, aggregate, correlate and analyze millions of data points from our network, offering us intelligence about the health of our network, services and anomalies in our network that are critical to the customer experience.\nIn the past, this type of real-time network intelligence did not exist, and substantial human effort and manual analysis were required to manage our network, which was time-consuming and brought only limited insights and required thousands of service transactions. In many cases, our intelligence now allows us to avoid network outages and disruptions altogether, maintaining the plant more efficiently with far less activity and cost and fewer outages in service transactions.\nOur mobile business is growing at an extremely rapid pace. We remain the fastest-growing mobile provider in the nation, and we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offerings, helping to drive customer growth and making our mobile business economics, which are good, even better. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're able to offer consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars a year.\nAnd our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, we capture less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offerings, we can do that, which, in turn, raises connects, reduces churn and drives overall customer relationship growth.\nIn addition, our mobile business will drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter, even at our existing and very attractive mobile price points, giving us EBITDA growth simply by growing our mobile customer base. We're underpenetrated and our opportunity is large. Charter remains uniquely positioned to deliver superior services at superior prices, offering consumers the most attractive products for their connectivity needs. Our services remain the best choice for consumers, giving us the opportunity to continue to grow our business at a very healthy pace. Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Now let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we lost 21,000 Internet customers in the second quarter. As part of the EBB to ACP transition, a small portion of subsidized Internet customers either did not opt to continue their service after the EBB program ended or did not meet the ACP requirements, particularly the requirement that customers use their service in each 30-day period, which covers the vast majority of the impacted subscribers. This resulted in 59,000 customer disconnects during the quarter.\nExcluding that headwind, we organically grew 38,000 Internet customers in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect that 0 usage ACP customers will have a smaller impact in our quarterly results than what we saw this quarter. Looking at the broader marketplace, while we saw seasonal increases in moves typical of the second quarter, moves remained well below pre-COVID levels. And voluntary churn, when excluding the EBB, ACP impact I mentioned, was even lower than last year, all of which reduced our selling opportunities.\nTurning to video. Video customers declined by 226,000 in the second quarter, following a programming pass through increase. Wireline voice declined by 266,000, and we added 344,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 282,000 or 1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2.8% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups and earlier video rate adjustments versus last year that pass through programmer rate increases. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue.\nAs Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 4.5% year-over-year. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.7%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 8.2%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.7% year-over-year.\nSecond quarter advertising revenue grew by 12% year-over-year. That growth came primarily from political. It was slightly offset by a 1% decline in our core advertising business due to lower local and national advertising revenue, including auto, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nMobile revenue totaled $726 million with $299 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 8% -- 8.8% year-over-year and includes rural construction initiatives subsidies totaling $29 million. In total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 6.2% year-over-year.\nMoving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In 2Q, total operating expenses grew by $307 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.2% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, all of which was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2022, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range.\nRegulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 10.3%, primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs and lower video CPE sold to customers. The decline in Lakers RSN cost was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges in 2Q '21, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 4.7%.\nFor the full year 2022, we continue to expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021, primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given an abnormal Lakers game schedule last year.\nCost to service customers increased by 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt year-over-year given lower bad debt in the second quarter of 2021, which benefited from government stimulus packages at the time. And while this quarter's nonpaid churn and bad debt write-offs both remain well below pre-COVID levels, our bad debt accrual includes expectations for potential softening of consumer finances later this year. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.1% primarily due to a larger customer base and higher fuel costs partly offset by productivity improvements.\nAs the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive slower growth in cost to service customers expense during the second half of the year. Marketing expenses grew by 8.6% year-over-year due to higher labor costs driven by previously planned wage increases and higher staffing levels as Charter completes the insourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect marketing expense to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021.\nMobile expenses totaled $797 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue. Customer acquisition and service and operating costs and other expenses increased by 1.3%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter.\nJust a quick note on inflation before moving on to net income. We've seen some inflationary pressure in fuel, freight and utilities as well as pricing pressure on CPE and other network components. In labor, our planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage blunted the impact, but we still see pressure in the labor market, which we may need to more fully respond to as the year progresses.\nI would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure. But given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe that we're well positioned for this environment.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.5 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $1 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in the second quarter above last year's second quarter spend of $1.9 billion. We spent a total of $357 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that then relates to design, walk out and make ready, and as expected, has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions. We spent $95 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back-office systems and wireless offload construction.\nAs Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.7 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.1 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx, mostly driven by our rural construction initiatives.\nWe finished the quarter with $95.7 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.5 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 8.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $4.3 billion at an average price of $511 per share. And given where the share price has been, during the first 2 quarters of this year, we repurchased 7.2% of our fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, for approximately $7.8 billion.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

Welcome to the Charter's First Quarter 2022 Investor Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVP of IR, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's First Quarter 2022 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.\nBefore we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas M. Rutledge\n\nChairman & CEO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stefan. We continue to grow our business by offering superior converged connectivity products. During the quarter, we added 129,000 customer relationships and 185,000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains low due to current consumer behavior while connect activity opportunities also remain low as a result.\nWe continued to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 373,000. Over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4 million total mobile lines.\nFinancials were also strong in the first quarter. First quarter revenue and EBITDA each grew by 5.4%. And when excluding a onetime payment, free cash flow grew by 9% year-over-year.\nAs always, we remain focused on our primary goal of driving customer growth and market share, leading to higher free cash flow. We're doing that in a number of ways, including expanding our footprint with good returns on investment; upgrading our network to ensure that we're offering our latest and fastest high-quality connectivity services and continuing to invest in high-quality customer service; and finally, investing in the mobile business to drive convergence of fixed and mobile connectivity products and earn a higher share of monthly household communication spend by saving customers money.\nOur rural construction initiative is also progressing as planned, and we've started to work in all 24 of the states where we won Rural Digital Opportunity Fund bids. Our multiyear, multibillion-dollar rural construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country. Through RDOF, we'll add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next 5 or so years.\nAnd our construction is not limited to RDOF commitments. We continue to build in other rural areas and are pursuing opportunities to receive other broadband stimulus funds. In addition, we regularly expand our network to additional residential, SMB and enterprise passing wherever it's economically attractive.\nUltimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but it's also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth by growing customers in unserved and underserved areas.\nDemand for our customers for greater connectivity speeds and data throughput continue to grow at a very fast pace. During the quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used approximately 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month.\nTo meet that growing demand, we're both expanding the capacity and reallocating capacity within our network. And the technology to both expand and reallocate plant bandwidth is developing rapidly. Today, we're implementing high splits of what we prefer to call spectrum splits, which allocate more plant capacity to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we're able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds.\nAdditionally, by expanding and reallocating plant capacity, we reduced our network augmentation capital spending, including no split spending going forward. And the vast majority of our deployed modems are already spectrum split-capable, allowing us to provide faster service to our existing customers without swapping out their CPE.\nWe've been increasing the number of spectrum split projects in our service areas, and we'll continue to do so. And as the technology develops further, we'll shift our strategy dynamically to further expand the capacity of our plant and reallocate bandwidth as necessary to meet customer needs by deploying additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0, which will allow us to deliver even greater capacity, offering consumers the fastest and lowest latency connectivity products in a highly capital-efficient way, driving customer and market share growth and free cash flow.\nIn mobile, we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offering, helping to drive customer growth and improving mobile business economics. In April, we began the market rollout of mobile speed boost. Mobile speed boost allows Spectrum Mobile customers to receive speeds up to 1 gigabit per second on their Spectrum Mobile service devices when inside their homes even when their provisioned wireline Internet speed is less than a gigabit. The rollout of our first trial of our CBS small cells in full market area continues to progress nicely.\nIn the first quarter, we completed the build-out of our mobile core network for the upcoming trial. We expect the trial to begin in the middle of next year and to offer faster speeds, a better mobile experience, all the while saving us costs. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're offering to consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars per year.\nAnd our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband, is still very low. In fact, we capture well less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offering, we can do that, which in turn raises connects, reduces churn and drives customer growth.\nBefore turning the call over to Jessica, I wanted to make a few comments about the joint venture with Comcast that we announced earlier this week. Our joint venture will provide video delivered by apps, a competitive app store, on-TV applications and is capable of aggregation, navigation, search and curation, billing and content security. It will give consumers new devices and content providers new opportunities to create customer relationships on a platform designed to help them sell video effectively.\nComcast has created excellent IP for this venture, and we have high expectations that we can work together to continue its development and distribution. We have a history of success in our mobile JV operating systems, demonstrated by the fact that between our 2 respective mobile businesses, we added more mobile lines in the first quarter of this year than the rest of the mobile industry added collectively.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica M. Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's now turn to our customer results on Slide 5. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 129,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customer relationships by 185,000 in the quarter. We continue to see record low combined competitive and move churn, which has reduced our selling opportunities and very low nonpay churn across our footprint.\nSimilar to the fourth quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the first quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. And this was true across our footprint regardless of competing technology.\nTurning to video. Video customers declined by 112,000 in the first quarter. Wireline voice declined by 150,000, and we added 373,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service.\nMoving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 674,000 or 2.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups and video rate adjustments that pass through programming rate increases. These effects were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of low-priced video packages within our base.\nAdditionally, this quarter's revenue was negatively impacted by $20 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video consumers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter with no impact to adjusted EBITDA.\nExcluding the impact of sports network credit I just mentioned, our residential ARPU grew by 1.2% year-over-year. Also, keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue or video programming pass-through increases announced late in the first quarter.\nAs Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year and by 3.9% year-over-year when excluding the sports network credit.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 4.6% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 4.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.5%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 5.2% year-over-year.\nFirst quarter advertising revenue grew by 11.5% year-over-year or by 5.1% excluding political revenue, primarily due to our growing advanced advertising capabilities.\nMobile revenue totaled $690 million with $292 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 5.2% year-over-year and includes 2 months of rural construction initiative subsidies totaling $19 million. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 5.4% year-over-year.\nMoving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $410 million or 5.4% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.4% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 2.1%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $20 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned and $34 million of other favorable adjustments, much of which was not unique year-over-year. All of that was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.4%.\nAnd looking at the full year 2022, we now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range versus mid-single digits previously.\nRegulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 7.4% primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs, lower video CPE sold to customers and lower regulatory and franchise fees. The decline in Lakers costs was primarily driven by the delayed start to the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges into Q1 of 2021, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 5.6%.\nAnd for the full year 2022, we expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021 primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given the abnormal Lakers game scheduled last year.\nCost to service customers increased by 5.3% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt, given unusually low bad debt in the first quarter of 2021 when bad debt was down $100 million versus the first quarter of 2020, benefiting from the government stimulus packages. In fact, payment trends in the first quarter continue to be very good. And excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.8% primarily due to a larger customer base, previously planned wage increases to $20 per hour starting wage for hourly field operations and call center employees and higher health benefit and fuel costs.\nAs the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive meaningfully slower growth in cost to service expense line during the second half of the year.\nMarketing expenses grew by 10.1% year-over-year due to higher labor costs driven by previously planned wage increases and temporarily greater staffing levels as Charter completes the in-sourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we expect marketing expense to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021, although marketing expense growth is likely to remain at elevated levels in the second quarter.\nMobile expense totaled $760 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs.\nAnd other expenses increased by 12.5% primarily driven by a favorable nonrecurring adjustment in the prior year period, making for a challenging comparison this year and higher labor costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 5.4% year-over-year in the quarter.\nA quick note about inflation before moving on to net income. Certain costs of operating our business such as labor and fuel costs are currently subject to inflationary pressure. But given our previously planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage and our long-term relationships and contracts for goods and services, we haven't yet seen a significant impact on inflation in our P&L.\nI would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure, but given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe we are well positioned for the changing market.\nTurning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $800 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by a nonrecurring litigation settlement charge in other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 and higher adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter, just above last year's first quarter spend of $1.8 billion. We spent a total of $232 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that spend relates to design, walk out and make ready and as expected, has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extension.\nWe spent $74 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems.\nAs Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.8 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, a decrease of $55 million or 3% year-over-year. Excluding a onetime litigation payment of $220 million made in the first quarter, free cash flow grew by $165 million or 8.9% year-over-year.\nPlease note that in the second quarter, we'll begin making quarterly cash tax payments for fiscal year 2022. These payments are consistent with the cash tax outlook that we provided in our fourth quarter investor call.\nWe finished the quarter with $94.9 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.43x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $3.6 billion at an average purchase price of $600 per share. And since September of 2016, we've repurchased $60.4 billion or nearly 42% of Charter's equity.\nOur path to continue to grow our business remains strong, and we will do that by furthering convergence in our connectivity business, allowing us to capture additional share, focusing on expanding our footprint and by continuing to improve the customer experience and extending customer lives. By executing on those items, we will drive customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

Welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2021 Investor Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\n\nStefan Anninger\n\nVP of IR, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2021 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.\nBefore we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.\nVarious remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.\nOn today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas M. Rutledge\n\nChairman & CEO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the fourth quarter with solid customer growth and strong financial growth. In October, we launched our new Spectrum Mobile multiline pricing and packaging, which allows Spectrum Mobile customers to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on their personal communication spend.\nAnd we had our strongest mobile quarter ever with 380,000 line net adds. For the full year 2021, we added 940,000 new customer relationships, and we added over 1.2 million Internet customers for growth of over 4%. We also grew our mobile lines by 1.2 million.\nFinancials were also strong in 2021. We grew full year revenue and EBITDA by 7.5% and 11.4%, respectively, and free cash flow grew by 23% year-over-year to $8.7 billion.\nAs we look forward to the rest of this year, we remain focused on several strategic priorities and goals, including product development and network evolution, our rural construction initiative and driving customer growth and penetration. And although the business environment in which we're operating remains unusual, we believe our goals and priorities will continue to foster our growth and prepare us well when the marketplace returns to historical levels of marketplace activity and sales.\nFundamental to our success is the delivery of products and services that are superior to what our competitors can offer. Delivering more speed and throughput to our customers remains a key area of focus.\nIn December, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than prepandemic levels. And nearly 25% of our nonvideo Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. So we continue to see very high demand for throughput by our customers.\nIn order to increase the capacity of our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multifaceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies, which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. In 2022, we'll increase the number of projects to deploy high splits in our service areas. High splits are powerful, cost-efficient upgrades that use our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure and allow us to comfortably offer gigabit speeds at symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Additionally, high splits will significantly reduce our network augmentation capital spending, including node spending.\nWe also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 technology, plant architecture and rollout, which will allow us to cost efficiently offer higher multi-gigabit speeds in the future. We recently ran a DOCSIS 4.0 test using frequency division duplexing, and we successfully delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream, and there's more to come from that technology.\nOther areas of product development in 2022 include speed boosting our WiFi connections, while Spectrum Mobile customers are on their Spectrum Mobile devices connected to any Spectrum WiFi access point enabled for mobile service. We also just turned on 5G C-band for all Spectrum Mobile customers who have a C-band enabled device, which means they can get faster 5G speeds while on the go. Both of the speed boosting enhancements I just mentioned are included in our mobile pricing at no extra charge.\nWe're also rolling out our 5G hybrid mobile network operation using CBRS small cells in a full market area, allowing selected participants to connect to our CBRS small cell access points when they're outside of WiFi coverage. By furthering the convergence of our fixed and mobile broadband service, we not only improve the economics of our mobile business but improve the customer experience. In fact, for the last 10 quarters, Global Wireless Solutions has ranked our mobile service the fastest in the country because we combine our Internet and mobile connectivity together with our state-of-the-art WiFi service.\nAnother key piece of our long-term strategy is treating customer service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their Spectrum services and interactions with us whenever and however they want. We continue to work on improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing and monetizing a number of elements of our customer, field and network operations groups.\nOur rural construction initiative also remains a key focus. Our multiyear, multibillion-dollar construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country.\nThrough the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, or RDOF, we will add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next 5 years. We're also in the midst of hiring more than 2,000 employees and contractors to support our rural expansion.\nBut our rural construction initiative is not limited to RDOF commitments. We'll continue to build in other rural areas as well, and we will pursue opportunities to receive broadband stimulus funds, including the American Rescue Plan, Act funds and funds from Infrastructure Investment Act and Jobs Act. We'll also extend our network passed homes in areas adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not currently reach today.\nUltimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but it's also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns.\nFinally, as we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving customer growth, market share growth and penetration by offering high-quality products and services at attractive prices. Our network allows us to deliver a unique, fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\nAnd our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband, is still very low. In fact, Slide 4 in the presentation shows we only capture about 27% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase the market share with superior products, saving customers money. And through our latest offering, we can do that.\nAn average household mobile broadband spend with 2 lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband is approximately $200 a month. With our new multiline pricing and packaging launched in October, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and 2 lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less and save at least $700 a year. So far, we've seen a very strong response to our offering with our fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for mobile line net adds yet. In fact, despite a very competitive environment, we continue to gain lines at a very rapid pace because of the value in our bundled service offering, which drives more EBITDA and free cash flow per customer and per passing value for shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\n\nJessica Fischer\n\nCFO, Charter Communications, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's turn to our customer results on Slides 6 and 7. Please note that we will continue to reference COVID-19-related financial impacts from 2020 and included again on Slides 19 and 20 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons.\nWe grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 120,000 in the fourth quarter and by 939,000 in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 190,000 in the quarter and by 1.2 million or 4.2% over the last 12 months.\nAlthough our Internet customer growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, the business environment in which we are operating has not yet normalized. Similar to the third quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019.\nTurning to video. Video customers declined by 58,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 154,000, and we added 380,000 mobile lines. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 3.6 million mobile lines. And despite the lower numbers of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies.\nMoving to the financial results, starting on Slide 8. Over the last year, we grew residential customers by 847,000 or 2.9%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and $22 million of COVID-related impacts in the prior period. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends that we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base.\nAdditionally, this quarter includes $31 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video customers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter with no impact to adjusted EBITDA.\nAlso keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 8 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.1% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and ARPU growth.\nTurning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 5.8%. This growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $8 million that negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.9%.\nEnterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%. And enterprise PSUs grew by 5.3% year-over-year, a bit faster than last quarter.\nFourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 28.2% year-over-year primarily due to strong political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, partly offset by COVID impacts last year. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, advertising revenue increased by 3.3% primarily due to our growth in advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by local -- lower local ad revenue, particularly automotive. If you exclude automotive, fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2019.\nMobile revenue totaled $632 million with $266 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 6.2% year-over-year driven by lower levels of CPE sold to customers.\nIn total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year. And when excluding advertising, which benefited from political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue grew by 6.4%.\nMoving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 9. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $203 million or 2.7% year-over-year. Programming costs decreased by 0.5% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 2.3%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $31 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned earlier and $19 million of other favorable adjustments, all of which was partially offset by the high -- by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.2%.\nLooking at the full year 2022, we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 11.3% primarily driven by higher Lakers RSN costs, partially offset by lower original programming costs and regulatory and franchise fees. The Lakers cost growth was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove fewer Lakers games charges in Q4 of '20, making for a challenging comparison to this year. Excluding RSN costs from both years, regulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 3.5%.\nCost to service customers declined by 0.5% year-over-year compared to 3% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs, mostly offset by previously announced wage increases, which will ultimately provide all hourly employees at Charter a starting minimum wage of $20 per hour by the end of the first quarter.\nMarketing expenses grew by 4.3% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $724 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs.\nAnd other expenses declined by 6.5% driven primarily by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year, given the decline in political ad revenue this year and a onetime corporate cost in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.7% year-over-year in the quarter.\nTurning to net income on Slide 10. We generated $1.6 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $1.2 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 11. Capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with last year's fourth quarter spend, although the components of that spend were a bit different. Upgrade and rebuild grew by $66 million year-over-year due to plant replacement in those portions of our footprint that were damaged by Hurricane Ida. Scalable infrastructure spend declined by $45 million, given a stabilized level of network traffic growth and investments made earlier this year. We spent $127 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs.\nFor the full year 2021, cable capital intensity was lower than in 2020 and in line with our outlook. As we look to the full year 2022, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures associated with our rural construction initiative, to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion.\nWe hope to spend about $1 billion in 2022 on capital expenditures related to our rural construction initiative or our construction within census block groups that are defined as rural. That spending includes our RDOF and other subsidized rural construction projects such as ARPU-related bills and spend associated with extending our plant to rural homes adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not reach today. We may not reach that targeted spend given a number of factors, including pull permitting and equipment and labor availability.\nConversely, we continue to bid on additional broadband stimulus projects that could increase 2022 capital spending for overall construction initiative. Given the variables, our actual rural construction initiative spending may differ meaningfully from our target.\nAs Tom mentioned, the expansion of our footprint into rural areas will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns. And we view our rural construction initiative as similar to or equivalent to acquiring a rural cable operator. We plan to begin disclosing additional operating information associated with our rural construction initiative in 2022.\nTurning to mobile. We expect our full year 2022 mobile capital expenditures to be about $100 million less than our full year 2021 mobile capital spend, which totaled $482 million. Our 2022 mobile capital spend will consist primarily of back-office system spend, the start of our CBRS small cell construction and some additional store build-out.\nWe will continue to update you on our capital spending expectations as the year progresses. And as always, if we find new core cable, rural or mobile projects with attractive ROIs, we'll pursue them even if that means spending capital above our stated outlook.\nAs Slide 12 shows, we generated nearly $2.3 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of about $200 million or 10% year-over-year. We finished the third quarter with $91.2 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in January is $4.2 billion.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.39x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $5.3 billion at an average price of $702 per share. For the full year 2021, we purchased 25.3 million shares at an average price of $683 per share for a total spend of $17.3 billion. And between September of 2016 and December of 2021, we have repurchased $56.8 billion or about 40% of Charter's equity at an average price of $452 per share.\nTurning briefly to taxes. We expect to become a meaningful cash taxpayer in 2022. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 through 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to be approximately equal to our consolidated EBITDA less capital expenditures and cash interest expense multiplied by 23% to 25%.\nWe expect the cash tax rate in 2022 to be in the mid- to high teens range -- percentage range, given some of our tax attributes that have carried over from 2021. Those estimates would include partnership tax distributions to advance new house that are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple pull factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile.\nSo we're looking forward to the rest of 2022 as we remain well positioned to succeed and grow given strong demand for our products, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network remains state of the art. Our well-proven strategy, which offers customers the highest quality products at very attractive prices drives customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A.",

My name is Leila, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Salesforce Q3, Fiscal 2026 Conference Call. This conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers prepare reMarcs, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our Fiscal 2026 Q3 results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Robin Washington, Chief Operating and Finance Officer. We also have Srini Tallapragada, President and Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer, and Miguel Milano, President and Chief Revenue Officer, joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.

And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right, great job, Mike. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, as you can see, first of all, great seeing everyone at Dreamforce. We are so happy that you are all with us. Now you can see we've delivered strong results for the quarter across all of our key metrics. We're continuing to execute on the path to our $60 billion dream that we outlined in detail with all of you at Investor Day. We delivered really strong bookings. Miguel is here. He's going to talk to you about that. We've delivered incredible results with Agentforce. It's really exceeding our expectations. We're going to hit all the details, but I think that you can see 3.2 trillion tokens delivered for our customers. It's all exceeding our expectations. We're going to get into all of that detail as well. That's the core of our organic innovation.\nWe're making these disciplined strategic acquisitions like Informatica, also now online in the company. We're really excited about the harmonization, integration, and federation that Informatica plus Data 360 plus MuleSoft is giving us. That's going to strengthen our overall leadership in data and, of course, AI. We're ensuring that we have the distribution capacity. That's extremely important for us because we are a direct seller in place to support long-term growth. Miguel has made some fantastic investments over the last 12 months in all of our core segments, and we're going to talk about that as well.\nAnd finally, Robin is going to speak in more detail about the capital allocation strategy and the investments that we're making for fiscal year 2027, which we're getting very excited about, and a very clear focus on our continued path for, I would say, very sustainable, profitable, durable growth and innovation in the company. Now, you are all at Dreamforce. You saw that energy, the level of customer success. It exceeded my expectations. And you saw how we're bringing humans, data, AI, apps together to build the Agentic Enterprise. And we just couldn't be more excited about that and how customers are receiving the message. Every CEO I met at Dreamforce, and I mean, every CEO I speak to just in the last couple of days, I had some great meetings.\nI'll tell you that everyone knows that they want to get to the next level in their business, to bring AI in, become more productive, become more efficient, become elevated, as Matthew said in the opening video. But they all know they now, they've got to become these agentic enterprises. I don't think for a lot of them, two years, three years ago, maybe even a year ago, they really understood that opportunity. They are now more motivated than ever to do it. We're going to hear about that, some great stories from the quarter. Of course, you know we've all read that crazy MIT study where customers went off trying to build their own models and trying to build their own toolkits and this and that and DIY it. Now they realize the real value from AI is delivering, number one, customer agents.\nAnd we have so many examples, but now I think about $500 million in Agentforce revenue, talking about customer agents. But also, and what's really exciting here at Salesforce, and some of you have seen it, but probably a lot of you haven't, is employee agents. And we've really delivered an incredible new framework, deeply integrated into our Slack product. Every Salesforce employee already uses it every day. I do. And it's the core of every demonstration we give to our customers to show how we have unleashed with Slack something new called Slackbot, which is really the heart of our employee agent strategy. And you're going to see that. It's incredible.\nIt is able to go not only through Slack, but not only through the whole internet, but also through all of our customers' data that they have basically provisioned in a secure way through Salesforce as well, and deliver a context. And I'll tell you, now, before I do a customer visit or call or whatever it is, I'll just kind of sit right down. I was with a really good friend of mine. Just this weekend, I had lunch with him, and he's a top venture capitalist. And he had been a huge investor in Coinbase. And I'll tell you that we were just sitting there just talking about, hey, tell me about everything with your venture capital company. Tell me everything about this venture capitalist. And then also tell me everything about Coinbase and the company and our relationship.\nAnd then, bam, you know it's able to deliver to me an absolute and complete not only analysis, not only a summarization, not only all of the detail, but next steps, how to sell, what I should do exactly for the customer. And I love doing this to customers because they don't think it's possible. And then when they see it, they say, wow, this is what AI was meant to be. And I'm like, this is context. This is data. This is apps. This is the best of the large language models and delivering it all to you. Well, anyway, let's get into the quarter. Q3 revenue was up $10.26 billion. It's up 9% year over year, 8% in constant currency. Our non-GAAP operating margin came in strong at 35.5%. And CRPO was outstanding. You see already $29.4 billion, up 11%.\nMiguel is going to talk about this great quarter he had, the best quarter I think we've had actually in three years, and 11% in constant currency. RPO is nearly $60 billion, growing 12% year over year. Kind of huge numbers, but very exciting, considering we've also rebuilt all the products as well and delivering this AI future for everyone. This really is signaling to us that it's a strong pipeline, a future revenue as customers ground their AI future in Agentforce. The Q3 operating cash flow was a whopping $2.3 billion, up 17% year over year. Free cash flow was $2.2 billion, up 22% year over year. We expect to finish the year with nearly $15 billion in operating cash flow. That was pretty awesome, I think. I think it's more operating cash flow at $15 billion than even Walmart. So that's awesome.\nAgentforce and data reached nearly $1.4 billion in ARR in the quarter, up 114% year over year, including Agentforce ARR of about $540 million, 330% year over year. I think all of our account executives, you know I got about 15,000 of them. I don't know what the exact number is out there, are all selling this now. People really can understand it. We can demo it. We can show it. But I think you've all seen what our customers are doing. The one I love and that I use because I'm a huge customer is Williams-Sonoma's version of Agentforce, which they call Olive. If you haven't been on the Williams-Sonoma support, Williams-Sonoma's website and seen the sous-chef that they call Olive and used it, I think the quality is what I'm most impressed with, that it's really very, very good. You don't see hallucinations.\nYou see really kind of the customer personality, the quality, the ability to deliver value. And they are saying it's about 60% of their chats. We've got a whole nother level to go with them with voice, which is coming, which is very exciting. This is our fastest growing product ever. And every Salesforce app now, not just sales, service, marketing, commerce, all of them, Tableau, Slack, our new ITSM, supply chain products, they've all been rebuilt. And Srini here is going to talk about what we've done to bring Agentforce into every product we have. And we transform Agentforce from being a product to a platform so that all of our apps can reason, learn, take action, collaborate with users. But it's really about humans and apps and the AI and the data all working together.\nAnd that is what's so exciting, that every part of our platform is now so deeply integrated. And because all the data is unified and every app shares the same metadata, they speak the same language. And you really get that feeling when you are using the Slackbot. And Srini will tell you about it because all of a sudden, Slackbot is able to read across all of our data, but then talk directly to you and give you that elevated experience. So when an LLM is interacting with Agentforce, it's getting that strategic context from our data, from the data on the internet as well, from the data that it's been trained in, and then knows how your business operates. It's really able to give you that. And that's because Salesforce is unique in that we have data that makes business more valuable.\nIt's that customer data, the service data, the sales data, the marketing data. And then we're able to deliver it in a tremendously friendly way. We've rebuilt all of our products to deliver this agentic enterprise, really just getting going. I think Srini will tell you, if we were really brainstorming a few years ago when we first created our GPT series, where we're starting to begin to integrate the large language models, I don't think we exactly knew that at this point, we were able to deliver this incredible customer agent experience and this incredible employee agent experience. In fact, six of our top 10 deals in the quarter are now driven by companies that just want to transform with Agentforce. And that's a big thought because a year ago, we were basically just starting to ship the product. It was just coming out of beta.\nIt was like a very strong version one, but it's more than a strong version one now. I think everyone can go and look at that example with Williams-Sonoma, or with SharkNinja, or with, I mean, there's so many great examples that I use every day. I know Miguel's got his reMarcable pad in front of him. So I think that in just a year since we introduced Agentforce, we've closed over 18,500 Agentforce deals. 9,500 of them are paid transactions. It's up 50% quarter over quarter. All of our reps now kind of have the acuity. They've got the nomenclature. They're enabled. That was a huge lift for us to start to bring the whole company into this AI revolution and give them the tools and now these great customer examples. It's happening around the world.\nI just got back from Japan, and I saw it there. I was in the UK. I saw it there. I've seen it, obviously, throughout the whole United States. It's really a global phenomenon. So Agentforce is now powered. Here's a few interesting things. Agentforce is powered 1.2 billion large language model calls. That's interactions when agents invoke a model to understand context and decide the next best action across the apps. You've seen the Omni-Channel Supervisor built into the Service Cloud where all of a sudden, I'm a customer. I'm coming into the website, even like Salesforce to help.salesforce.com or any of our customers' websites. And I'm in there, and I'm working. And then all of a sudden, I've hit kind of the limit of what the LLM can do. I can escalate immediately, also right to a human.\nAnd that's where the humans and the agents and the AI and the data all have to work together. Our top 50 customers, including, and Miguel's got this story in his pocket, but Falabella, Vivint,DIRECTV, there's so many great stories. More than 200 million Agentforce LLM calls in Q3 alone on track to power another 2 billion over the next year. And those LLMs now are calling these Agentforce actions, such as updating the opportunities, creating a case, handling service inquiry. And the number of average weekly actions has now risen about 140% Q over Q. So we're really seeing the adoption and the usage. And that's what's more exciting. And here's a number we really haven't focused on, I think, in an earnings script. And I don't even think we hit it last time exactly. But Agentforce has processed more than 3.2 trillion tokens.\nSo 3.2 trillion tokens for our LLM gateway so far. And we're going to start talking about that concept. We saw that in OpenAI's recent announcement that we were in their trillion token club. And of course, we use all of the large language models. They're all great. We love all of them. We love all of our children. But they're also all just commodities. And we can have the choice of choosing whatever one we want, whether it's OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic, or there's other open source ones. They're all very good at this point. So we can swap them in and out. The lowest cost one is the best one for us, making us basically the top user of these foundation models.\nAt that point that we did 3.2 trillion tokens, let Bilbo Baggins know that we've got adoption and usage happening here with this large language model gateway. That was just a shout-out to J.R.R. Tolkien himself. But that's the end of the jokes for the call. In October alone, token usage was nearly 540 billion, up 25% month over month. And I just don't think any other enterprise software company has stats quite like this. This isn't your Clippy. This is not your kind of a good AI demo. This is real enterprise adoption of agentic AI and capability at scale globally. And those numbers are going to keep growing as customers put Agentforce to work across their business. But not every task or step in a workflow needs to call the LLM. We call that determinism.\nAnd determinism is really important because for those of us who grew up in software, we used to call it if-then statements. But now we call it determinism. But determinism is that, hey, if I need to do this, go to the LLM. But if I probably don't need to go to the LLM, just do that. So that is going to even reduce our costs further and not hit the LLM as much as we do. And that's why we built hybrid reasoning and Agent Script. And our AI teams are just crushing it on that. And we're giving customers the best of both worlds, combining LLM-driven reasoning and deterministic precision. We had strong performance across Agentforce Service, Agentforce Sales, and Slack. And those three apps are just a powerful combination for just us at Salesforce because we use those every single day. We live on them.\nIt is really the hat trick for Salesforce with large customers to say, let us show you what we're doing in service. Let us show you what we're doing in sales. Let us show you what we're doing in Slack. And it's a wow experience right now. It's only going to get better. And in fact, if we included the full contribution of Agentforce just in service, we used to call it Service Cloud. Now we call it Agentforce Service. But you look at Agentforce Service; we would show an additional point of growth in Q3. Now, Mike likes to carve off the agent thing, revenue. He wants to have it in his own line, blah, blah, blah. It's a huge argument between me and Mike. And the reality is, look, you're not going to have Agentforce Service or Agentforce Sales without the AI. So it's just moving.\nAnd Slack is now where it's coming all together. And that is this incredible conversational interface for every app, every agent, every workflow. I'm going to get to a really cool point in a second. And when we release this new Slackbot, you've got to see it. So you've all got friends who are Salesforce employees. Take them aside and have them show you Slackbot. And just do whatever query you want and say, hey, I'm talking to this customer. I'm talking to that. Tell me this. And you're going to see some incredible things, how it has the ability to search across Salesforce and build agents and create things and do this incredible work on your behalf. Now, I'll tell you, and I'll just tell you that for me, Slackbot is like chatting with just one of our Ohana that knows everything about Salesforce. So it's pretty awesome.\nBut nearly 90% now of all of the Forbes top 50 AI companies are using Salesforce. Let's just think about that for a second. 90% of all the Forbes top 50 AI companies, those are the Anthropics, the OpenAIs, and the blah, blah, blah companies. Okay. That is, or Cognition, Cursor, Figure AI. Okay. They all average about four clouds each already. And 80% of them are using Slack to run their business. So if you're with those companies, hey, say, hey, show me how you're using Slack. They may not have Slackbot yet because we've only turned it on for a small number of customers. We're about to hit the switch, and everybody's going to see this employee agent power. So most people have seen the customer agent power. Now they're going to see the employee agent power.\nAnd they're going to see how it's built on Agentforce, how it's built on the apps, and how it's built on the data. Now, with all these companies, we're really partnering with them so we can really leverage the best of what they're building, the frontier models, the agents, and even Srini's using the coding agents now. And look, you've heard me say this over the last few years. And we kind of, Miguel's going to come to this point, but we all know the speed of innovation in the last three years has far outdated the speed of customer adoption. And customers have been racing to catch up to what we've been doing. But we do see that changing. And we saw that at Dreamforce. And I know all of you saw that also, that customers are really saying, yeah, I'm going to use this now.\nI'm going to do this. I'm going to put in my customer agents. I'm going to put my employee agents. I'm going to get my Omni-Channel Supervisor. I'm going to harmonize my data. I'm going to federate my data. I'm going to upgrade my apps. And customers in production with Agentforce have jumped now 70% year quarter over quarter. So customers in production with Agentforce jumped 70% quarter over quarter. That's the stats that we're looking for. Great companies like Uber, like Conagra, like LY, like Williams-Sonoma, like all these great companies that we've been talking about. And the consumption flywheel is gaining traction. In the quarter, more than 50% of new Agentforce bookings, as well as 50% of Data 360 bookings, came from existing customers expanding their investment, which was awesome and really showed adoption.\nWe are very focused on adoption more than ever before, especially as in Agentforce. Data 360 is the foundation for every Agentforce deployment, and it's accelerating. In Q3, Data 360, the product formerly known as Data Cloud, in Q3, Data 360 ingested 32 trillion records, 32 trillion records, up 119% year over year. And that includes 15 trillion through zero-copy data integration, up 341% year over year. So Dentsu, Moody's, KPMG, Ferguson, Zoom, and dozens more invested in Data 360 in the quarter. And I couldn't be more excited about completing our acquisition of Informatica. It's three months ahead of schedule as we like it here at Salesforce. We like things ahead of schedule, and we like them under budget. And I'll tell you, Amit, I know all of you know Amit. His team are great. We're thrilled to have them.\nWhen we were doing the due diligence on the company, we saw a lot of things in the labs that we're looking forward to bringing to the market. Because look, that data layer, and I haven't done the math exactly, but I think if you do some of the math, I think it's about a $10 billion business for us next year now. When you look at Data 360 plus MuleSoft plus Informatica, Mike has got his pencil out trying to figure out if I'm right, but I think I am. When you look at a $10 billion business, that's the first layer. That's data. So Informatica with Data 360, MuleSoft, I mean, that is taking everything to this new level.\nAnd when you get into the world of harmonization, integration, federation, and then you're trying to deliver to the AI the intelligence, the accuracy, the reliability to wipe out the hallucinations, delivering the AI context. Now, we're seeing momentum across multiple sectors. We had incredible wins this quarter. Miguel's going to talk to them about CVS Health, Telecom Argentina, TD Bank, and the IRS, somebody who's going to be getting a big check from all of us. They're now on Agentforce. So your IRS agents are Agentforce agents. And Engie and so many more are becoming agentic enterprises. And Costco, we love Costco. It's a great, well, we love all of our retailer friends equally. They're all of our children. But we do love that Costco warehouse experience. And it's a great expansion for us in the quarter.\nWe're driving AI and digitization across everything they do for their members. We're doing some incredible things there with Google. We worked with Javier, if you don't know Javier, probably one of the top, I don't know, five, one, two, I mean, best CIOs I've ever worked with in the whole industry. Was it Coke? Was it P&G? Was it Mondelez? Now, somehow Costco got him. I still don't know how Costco got Javier, but congratulations to Costco. So many times having great results there. So really excited to see these customers, especially these big customers. Of course, we know General Motors. We love Mary. Amazing. Have one of her new Escalade IQs. She's tired of me telling her how much I love it. Expanding Salesforce across the Automotive Cloud, Data 360, MuleSoft, Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service. But really cool, Agentforce plus their other collaborative product.\nWe won't tell you what it is, but you probably know the name. And they're now using Slack. So Mary, we're thrilled that you're doing that. We love working with you. You're an incredible CEO, and you're showing the world how to turn an iconic company into an agentic enterprise. Great products and great systems. And with Agentforce, Mary is speeding up case resolution for her call centers. Slack is now the company's primary communications hub, scaling to 96,000 employees in just nine months. Last month, we launched Agentforce IT Service, or Agentforce ITSM, or, you know, the IT company that we're targeting. We never really went after this before. And then all of a sudden, we realized we have the top service product in the world, and then we've got the top field service product in the world.\nCustomers want this kind of trinity from us that includes IT service. For whatever reason, because we had certain people in our company, we won't go into the names, who didn't want to build it. Building that database that drives it, well, already we're selling product and really doing a phenomenal job there. The former CEO of AI, Sarah Moody, is running this thing. PenFed went live with ITSM, with Agentforce for IT Service. We've got all kinds of customers who've bought products from these competitors and never deployed them, or don't like these guys. Well, guess what? We are going to deliver some incredible capabilities. We think that, well, when you look at PenFed, I think they went live with Agentforce for IT Service as well as member service and collections.\nThey're projecting a 30% reduction in operational expenses and $2 million in savings with this product. It is killer. So tell your friends who need ITSM. They can get it now from Salesforce. We're seeing incredible momentum also. Here's another competitive situation. Life Sciences Cloud. With Life Sciences Cloud, with new bookings tripling year over year, it's always been a strong vertical for us, but we have this partner who decided to become our competitor, Veeva. We're taking market share from Veeva. They even had to talk about it in their earnings call that they lost all these deals to us, but they have not seen the losses yet that are coming, highlighted by a notable new win at Haleon in this quarter, but just in the past few months, more than 120 industry leaders have selected Life Sciences Cloud.\nI was talking to the CEO of one of the top five life sciences companies just yesterday. He's a good friend of mine. Going to Life Sciences Cloud, all led, by the way, with Pfizer and Albert, who decided to be the number first one. So grateful to him. It's a great product. It includes five of the top 20 pharma companies already, but you're going to see them all use Life Sciences Cloud. Most recently, Novartis is gone Salesforce Life Sciences Cloud, and I don't know. Takeda, all of them are going to go. Our public sector solutions ARR also grew 50% year over year in Q3. Really cool products. I was just in Washington, D.C., last week. I already mentioned the IRS. I was with the Treasury Secretary. I was with a number of the Cabinet secretaries.\nAll of them are rebuilding what they're doing, re-automating. We want to help all of them. I'm inspired to see some of the largest, most impactful government agencies running their businesses and their critical workflows and their agents and their data on Salesforce, including the Air Force, Army, Dan Driscoll. We're really proud to work with Dan and the Army. He just told me he came in and delivered his recruiting goals nine months early using Agentforce Sales and Department of Agriculture. Of course, we run the whole Veterans Affairs. We have 120 apps there now. It used to be a huge problem, Veterans Affairs, for the whole country. Veterans were not getting the service and support they needed. We cleaned that up for them. As I mentioned, also the IRS, but for everyone, we're in there doing our best.\nWe're delivering at very reasonable cost and on budget. We're really excited to be working with the government and helping them to become agentic enterprises. We're really excited to work with the IRS. I just want to say the Office of the Chief Counsel has automated up to 98% of their manual activities, decreasing the time to fully open a tax court case from 10 days to 30 minutes. Another division saving an estimated 500,000 minutes a year, retiring multiple legacy systems. Now Agentforce with IRS is going to be able to further optimize, automate, accelerate business processes across the entire agency. Just want to congratulate Secretary Bessent for his tremendous leadership and what he's done in transforming the IRS and also all of the Treasury. This week, we launched the UK's first AI police officer.\nWe work with multiple police departments to roll out Bobby. Everybody loves Bobby. It's the Agentforce service agent that is the public's first point of contact for non-emergency calls. Bobby autonomously provides instant responses on more than 90 topics. Police departments have already seen a 20% reduction in non-emergency demand, and they are just getting started. This is what real enterprise adoption looks like. No other company is delivering agents of this scale. When you look at what others in our space are doing, the difference is clear. We're delivering this capability to a global customer base, more than 150,000 Salesforce customers. 1 million companies are now on Slack, now have the immediate opportunity to work side by side with agents and Agentforce, and the apps they're already using every day to become elevated. That's why we're uniquely positioned for this new era.\nWe have the strategy, the platform, the global scale. And I would say also our core values: trust, customer success, equality, and sustainability remain very much intact. I also want to thank all of our incredible Ohana for everything they've done during the quarter to make this quarter so successful, make Dreamforce so successful, and all the world tours that are happening, and so many great customer stories. But I especially want to thank all of our Ohana who have done 10 million volunteer hours to support the communities where they live and work. We are so grateful to them. And now I'd like to throw it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nChief Operating and Financial Officer, Salesforce\n\nThank you, Marc, and good afternoon, everyone. It was great to see many of you at my first Dreamforce COFO, which was unforgettable.\nThe energy was incredible, as Marc just talked about, and carried through the quarter, as you can see from our bookings momentum. We're excited to see our customers' transformation to the Agentic Enterprise accelerate, driven by Growth 360 Playbook, including multi-cloud, pricing and packaging, our balanced portfolio, and continued innovation. I just want to share a few key data points with you. More than 70% of our top 100 wins included five or more clouds. In pricing and packaging, new bookings for Agentforce One Edition and A for X, or as we call it, Agentforce for Apps, our most premium SKU doubled quarter over quarter. Our consumption flywheel is spinning. Agentforce accounts and production increased 70% quarter over quarter. And more than 50% of Agentforce bookings came from existing customers refilling the tanks. Agentforce and Data 360 ARR was up 114% year over year.\nThis is inclusive of Agentforce ARR, which is up 330% year over year. Clearly, we have the winning formula here. So let's turn to the results of the quarter. Revenue in the Q3 was $10.26 billion, up 9% year over year in nominal and 8% in constant currency, driven by the trifecta of Agentforce, Data 360, and Agentforce sales and service performance. This was partially offset by a faster-than-anticipated migration to cloud for Tableau and on-prem revenue timing in Tableau and MuleSoft. As we've shared with you before, the on-prem portion of MuleSoft and Tableau revenue is recognized in period, which creates less predictable revenue quarter over quarter. Subscription and support revenue grew 10% year over year in nominal and 9% in constant currency. Q3 revenue attrition ended the quarter at approximately 8%, in line with recent trends.\nWe delivered another quarter of profitable growth, with Q3 non-GAAP operating margin up 240 basis points and GAAP operating margin up 130 basis points. The strong performance this quarter was driven in part by timing of expenses and a bad debt expense adjustment based on our strong collection performance. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended Q3 at $29.4 billion, up approximately 11% year over year in nominal and constant currency, inclusive of a $200 million foreign exchange tailwind. This better-than-expected performance was driven by strong bookings and a modest benefit from early renewals, and the timing of on-prem revenue. I'm pleased to share that for the first time since fiscal year 2022, net new AOV growth outpaced AOV growth.\nFrom a geographic perspective, we saw strong business growth in North America and EMEA, led by France and the UK, while Asia-Pacific was more constrained, particularly in Australia and India. From a segment perspective, we continue to see strong performance in our small and mid-market business. Enterprise growth accelerated this past quarter. From an industry perspective, business services and consultancy, healthcare and life sciences, and retail and consumer goods performed well, while comms, media, and manufacturing, automotive, and energy were more measured. As committed, I wanted to quickly update you on the progress we made on our three strategic priorities. First, customer success. Repeating what Marc said, our top priority is accelerating Agentforce and Data 360 adoption. We are relentlessly reallocating our resources to high-growth areas, and it's paying off.\nQ3 was one of our biggest pipeline generation quarters ever, and customers leveraging our forward-deployed engineers are seeing 33% faster deployment times. Second, operational excellence. As customer zero, our SDR agent has worked hundreds of thousands of leads, generating tens of millions in incremental pipeline. We see that same velocity with Agentforce on helpsalesforce.com, which passed two million conversations this quarter. It took nine months to reach the first million and just half that time to double it. Another clear example of our internal consumption flywheel taking off. The third area I want to cover is responsible capital allocation. Informatica enhances our trusted data foundation, and it will be a credit within 12 months. We also returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in Q3.\nWe continue to see a meaningful opportunity to invest in ourselves, and we are on track for a 50% step-up in share repurchases in the second half of this fiscal year. Turning to guidance, I want to frame our outlook inclusive of Informatica. To help you model this clearly where relevant, I'll give our organic performance, layer in the acquisition impact, and then provide the consolidated figures for Q4 and fiscal year 26. Starting with subscription and support revenue, we are reiterating our fiscal year 26 organic subscription and support growth guidance of approximately 9% year over year in constant currency. This is fueled by continued momentum in Agentforce and Data 360, partially offset by weaknesses in marketing and commerce, and the on-prem dynamic for MuleSoft and Tableau.\nInformatica will contribute approximately 80 basis points of additional growth, resulting in total subscription and support growth of slightly under 10% year over year in constant currency. Turning to total revenue, we are narrowing our fiscal year 26 revenue guidance on an organic basis to $41.15 to 41.25 billion, growth of approximately 9% in nominal and 8% in constant currency. This is attributed to a $25 million FX headwind since last quarter and the on-prem dynamic for Tableau and MuleSoft. We anticipate a contribution of approximately 80 basis points from Informatica, resulting in fiscal year 26 revenue of $41.45 billion to 41.55 billion, or approximately 9% to 10 in nominal and approximately 9% in constant currency.\nBefore I turn to profitability, I want to highlight that with our current trajectory of net new AOV growth, we project to finish fiscal year 2026 with H2 net new AOV growth ahead of H2 AOV growth. Turning to margin. As a result of the close timing of Informatica, we are maintaining our non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 34.1% and adjusting our GAAP operating margin to 20.3%. We are raising our annual guidance on operating cash flow growth to approximately 13% to 14 growth as a result of our strong Q3 bookings performance. We expect capital expenditures to remain slightly below 2% of revenue, resulting in free cash flow growth of approximately 13% to 14. Organic CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 11% year over year in nominal, and 9% year over year in constant currency.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAs a reminder, we are lapping our acquisition of OWN in Q4 FY25, which represents slightly under a point of impact. Inclusive of Informatica, we expect CRPO growth of approximately 15% year over year in nominal, including a $500 million FX tailwind, resulting in approximately 13% constant currency growth. Consistent with our investor day outlook, we remain on track to re-accelerate revenue in 12 to 18 months. In closing, our momentum is building, fueled by Agentforce. We are executing against our FY30 framework and investing with discipline, positioning us incredibly well for the future. Finally, a big thank you to all our employees for their dedication and hard work delivering a successful Q3. I'll turn it back to you, Mike.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Robin. With that, we're going to move to the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, can we please move to the first question?\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin Q&A.\nFor today's session, we will be utilizing the raise hand feature. If you'd like to ask a question, simply click on the raise hand button at the bottom of your screen. Once you've been called on, please unmute yourself and begin to ask a question. Please limit to one question. Thank you. We will now pause a moment to assemble the queue. Your first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please unmute and ask your question.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Also great to see you guys putting your money where your mouth is and the accelerated share buybacks, expressing your conviction and sort of the value of Salesforce as a stock where it is.\nI had a question from Miguel and trying to sort of tap into your experience in talking to these large customers because there's still a very big mismatch in the marketplace in terms of what we hear from investors in terms of the expectation that generative AI is going to be injurious to the SaaS-based application layer, that enterprise customers are going to try to build their own functionality, are going to try to replace solutions like Salesforce with DIY solutions that they can build around these models versus what we're seeing in the inflection in your business. So can you talk to us a little bit about what you're hearing from customers and their appetite or desire, if they have one, of building out their own applications versus going to a vendor like Salesforce to try to get to this generative AI functionality or capabilities?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, Keith, thank you.\nThank you so much. That's a spot-on question. And it's the heart. I think it's the heart of the matter. And I think there is a really different perspective on what is really happening. This past quarter, I was in three continents, 12 countries. I talked to 400 customers, many one-on-ones, many one-to-several at dinners. And the reality is very different. There is something very large, very important, and I want to emphasize this. I don't think we've made, Marc and Robin, enough justice to what is happening right now in front of us. There is a new, very large secular demand trend, which is the Agentic Enterprise.\nEvery single company in the world, small, medium, large, wants to become an Agentic Enterprise, a company that is conversational, that is much smarter, that empowers employees by giving them extra information, that is able to execute autonomously, but also probabilistically on one side when AI wants to execute, deterministically when you want the current workflows to be executed. This is to increase growth, to reduce costs, to improve customer satisfaction. Every customer wants to do it. Now, the problem is they've been experimenting. They've been experimenting for two years. They've gone from experimentation now to frustration a little bit. Now they're all saying, you know what? This is hard. This is much harder than we thought. But they all want to go to scale because the opportunity, which is a multi-trillion, multi-trillion market cap opportunity, it's in front of us.\nThe time is multi-trillion for them, for us. And they want to go all in. They know it's hard because LLMs cannot do this alone. And now, to answer your question, the last mile is hard. And the last mile is hard because companies need the context. For enterprise AI to be successful and accurate in the enterprise, you need the context. You need the data. You need the metadata. You need the deterministic workflows. You don't want the agents to be essentially executing based on what they found in an LLM. You want the agents to execute in a deterministic way the same workflows that that company had already codified in the apps for the years that humans are already using. And they need AI that is embedded where the humans are.\nThat's why it's so important to have the data with the context, to have the apps, the deterministic workflows, to have the AI where the humans are. And only Salesforce can do that. And we are seeing an incredible increase in demand ahead of us. We are winning. You're seeing the bookings. I'm very proud of the quarter that we delivered. I'm very thankful to my team, the whole employee base of Salesforce. I'm also very thankful to our customers, and I'm very thankful to our partners. Marc, you want to add anything to that?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nNo, I think that was great. Thanks, Miguel. Well done.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMiguel, can I stay on that subject a little bit?\nYou've been expanding your sales reps quite a bit, and that's still part of the plan. How do you think about the ramping of those, and how do you also think about productivity for those extra reps coming on? Thank you.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nI have to credit Marc for that. We had a seminal moment a year ago where we, particularly Marc, he saw the demand coming, and he told us, let's invest in capacity. Let's also invest in enablement. So I became six months ago also the enablement leader for the company. And we have now today 20% more capacity in place. We're going to finish the year with 15% more capacity enabled already. We call it ramped. This is fundamental. It takes six to 12 months to, on average, to ramp AEs. We've done all the hard work exactly at the moment that the demand is coming at us.\nSo I see the pipelines growing. The top of the funnel is growing. We've never seen a pipe-gen quarter like we did in Q3 with essentially very healthy double-digit growth in pipe-gen above our expectations. Next year, open pipeline is, again, double-digit healthy growth on open pipeline. That, matching the double-digit healthy growth on enabled capacity, it is very exciting. We are ready to capture the opportunity. And again, this is not just one more cloud that now we are very excited. Agentforce, Data Cloud is going to add 10% to 20% on the business that we do with every customer. The Agentic Enterprise, it's a new paradigm. Customers will use Salesforce in a totally different way. They will use Salesforce to be the platform for digital labor, for sales, for service, for marketing. And the impact on the way we can monetize those relationships is exponential. It's not linear growth.\nIt's exponential. Robin alluded to that at Investor's Day. You were talking about three times, four times the ability to multiply the monetization on customers because, by the way, they are getting three or four times or ten times more value from our product. I'm already seeing a lot of examples of companies that had a great relationship with us, had a multi-cloud relationship with us, sales service, all our core clouds. They were very excited. And then Agentforce and Data Cloud came. They decided to become an agentic enterprise. They understood the last mile problem. They bet on Salesforce. And now the bookings that we do with them, the AOV, have doubled, tripled, in some cases, multiplied by four and five. And we are just getting started. We just want to get every single one of our 150,000, 200,000 customers through the agentic enterprise journey.\nAnd for each of them, there is going to be a multiplier effect.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, everyone. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. And my congrats on an amazing quarter. Marc, at this point, even without Informatica, and now more so with it, you have one of the largest infrastructure businesses in all of software, well over 10 billion in scale. What's Salesforce's competitive advantage in infrastructure? And how do you not only get credit for it in its own right, but leverage these core capabilities to drive the overall company's success?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nReally appreciate the question, Brad. I think, number one, just want to make sure everybody realizes we're not building data centers at Salesforce. We're preserving our gross margins and our cash flow. But we will use the data centers that are being built.\nAnd we will take advantage of the lower costs that we're seeing in the market from the incredible buildout of data centers. But yes, you're right. Our data infrastructure is incredible. We call it our data foundation. And I think you realize it composes, as I mentioned, three key things: Informatica, Data 360, our Data Cloud, and also MuleSoft. And together, you're right, I think it will do about $10 billion next year in business. So this is a very significant software business. But it's fundamental. It's key for every one of our customers to move to this data foundation. And we are still at the beginning of that journey with so many of our customers. And one of the keys to it is its federation. I just came back from Japan, as I mentioned. One of the most important companies in Japan, other than Salesforce, is IBM.\nIBM has about 8,000 employees in Japan. We have about 4,000 employees in Japan. I think we're the largest software company in Japan right now. The ability to federate Data 360 to the IBM mainframe, which is technology that we just introduced in Tokyo two weeks ago at our world tour. That idea that you're running Agentforce, but it is being fueled by not only the data and Data 360, but simultaneously the data in your IBM mainframe. That infrastructure is critical to delivering the AI that is accurate, that is reliable, that is low in hallucinations. This is fantastic for the company. It is not something that is totally independent. It's deeply integrated with everything that we do. All of our apps, Agentforce, our customer agents, our employee agents, everything is built on this fundamental foundation. I couldn't be more excited about it.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Marc, the halo effect Agentforce is having, I mean, it seems that sales and service were stable at high single-digit growth, Slack accelerated growth. Can you just speak to what you think this is doing for your other clouds and maybe even drill in on the Slack resurgence?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, you're right on it, Brent. I think that it's an accelerator on the core. And I think that to address the question that went to Miguel, where there was a false narrative that somehow the core is in jeopardy because of these large language models.\nAnd while the large language models are very important and they will expand in functionality, I'm sure, over time, the reality is that our ability to take our core applications, extend them, and deliver another level of value beyond what we were doing before. Now, we had already been doing predictive AI and all the kind of Einstein AI. But now with Agentforce, it's another level. And you could see it really at Dreamforce when we're demoing Agentforce Service with the Omni-Channel Supervisor and the ability for the agent and the humans to interact autonomously. That was just awesome because it's humans, agents, the apps, and the data. And that, I think, is what is really driving this forward. And it's happening in sales. It's happening in service. It's happening in Slack. And I'm confident it's going to happen in marketing. It's going to happen in commerce.\nIt's going to happen across every Tableau, across every single product. Every single product had to be rebuilt. So that took some time. I'd love for Srini to come in and kind of talk about that. But now, as we deliver those Agentforce products, and you saw each and every one of them at Dreamforce, how far they are, customers are excited to get to that next level. Srini?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nPresident and Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Just to kind of address those two questions, if you really look at agents, agents need context, really, and they need tools. And what is context? To get context, you need data across the enterprise, some in the company, which is in the platform, some you want to federate it, which is what we call zero-copy, and some through ingest, which is where Informatica is. You need to understand where all the data is in the company. You need a catalog.\nYou need a master metadata. You need to organize all this data. You need tools. This is what is enterprise context. Without having enterprise context, it's very, very hard. And that's what our data foundation gives with Informatica, MuleSoft, and Data 360. On top of that. And Srini, really drill into that because people still don't understand. So just so you know, just on the ingest, for example, in quarter over quarter on Data 360, people have built their data lake. Just in Data Cloud, our ingest has increased by 38%. And zero copy has increased by 52% growth in terms of records. But this is unstructured data. So it's just not the structured data. It's all your documents, all your knowledge articles, all your user manuals. That has increased by 109% growth.\nThen this is how you create this unified profile or unified product ID, unified customer master, unified account master. That's what is the unified context you want in a real-time profile. That's very hard to do. But just if you have this context, it's not enough. You need the deterministic place for reasoning, where deterministic, where non-deterministic. Then you need the tools. The agents have to take actions. Some of the actions are in Salesforce already, the jobs to be done over 25 years for each vertical. We have really deep understanding of not just a sales rep does. We know what a sales rep does in a financial industry, different from what a sales rep does in a pharma, which is different from what a sales rep does in a telecommunications industry. So that's the jobs to be done.\nNow, imagine you need the context, you need the jobs to be done, you need the tools. Sometimes you have backend systems where you need those APIs. That's why MuleSoft is very important. Now, if you just think these three are enough, it's not enough. Because once you go live, you need an eval. You need to know how the agents are performing. You need auditing. You need compliance. You need local data residency tools. This is what we are finding enterprises who did do-it-yourself are realizing that it's good news, actually, for me. When I talk to CIOs, I see two types. People who are really advanced, who are visionaries, who started two years back with do-it-yourself, they really understand the pain point. They are the ones who are moving fast to the platform.\nAnd then there are some people who still think they can do it and will convert them over years. So I see people who know what it takes, and so they know the day-two, day-three problems, and some people who still think. So to do this, it was not easy, correct? You had to build the platform. So four years back, we started with the Hyperforce layer. Then we created a data layer. We had to pull the data lake, a lake warehouse. That's what Data 360 was. We rebuilt the entire infrastructure on the platform, on the hyperscalers. We had to rewrite our entire metadata layer to do not thousands of records, but millions of objects. Then we had to rewrite all our applications, our core sales. It's no longer a Sales Cloud. It's Agentforce Sales. So because when I talk to Miguel, he doesn't just want a sales.\nHe wants to transform his function into agentic sales function. I run customer success. So my job is not to do customer success. I want to write agentic customer success. This is why help.salesforce.com is important. That's what he is saying. So imagine each of these applications are changing. But this framework is helping another thing. When we started doing ITSM, normally it would have taken a long time. But because we had the foundation of the data layer, the Agentforce layer, the metadata layer, suddenly building an agentic ITSM became very easy. And that's what you're trying to see, the leverage. Same with Life Sciences Cloud. So we're not trying to build the regular way, but this took time. And now that we have this customer success you're seeing, this is what is going to make it a differentiator. And that's our promise to our customers.\nOne more slight thing is our customers two years back; they would ask me, \"What model are you supporting? Where is it? What hyperscaler you're on?\" They don't ask me any of those things now because we abstract all that complexity for them. That's the original promise of Salesforce when we said no software. Basically, that's what it is. We bring the customers to the future. We want to help our customers go to the Agentic Enterprise. And that's what we are doing. And all our forward deployment motions with our own PS services, with our customer success team, also with our SI partners, heavily invested with Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, and other global partners to really ensure that we also jointly partner with them. And in a lot of places, we are co-selling them. They're having combined FDE training.\nThis together is what it takes to generate the Agentic Enterprise. That's how all these points we're trying to tie together. Hopefully, that answers your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nVery good.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore Partners.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore Partners\n\nYeah, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the momentum around Agentforce. Miguel, I think this one's for you. When Agentforce first came out, there were a lot of questions from partners, customers about pricing, just confusion, trying to get a handle on that. It seems with the momentum, people are more comfortable with that.\nAnd sort of the second part of the question is there's still a lot of concern among investors about, as Agentforce helps customers maybe keep headcount stable or even lower headcount in certain areas, how does Salesforce monetize in that kind of situation? And I was wondering if you could just touch upon that a little bit because I think that'd be helpful to people to understand how AOV grows even in, say, a stable or declining headcount situation. Thanks.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, thank you so much. Listen, Agentforce is at the heart of the agentic enterprise transformation. The momentum that we saw in Q3 is pretty significant, is unheard of, is beyond our expectations. And I want to differentiate between momentum on the bookings. Okay? Bookings is one part of the equation. The hardest part of the equation is the adoption.\nNow, on bookings, we saw the numbers of ARR, the 70% more customers in production. I think there's one statistic that we haven't mentioned, which is very powerful. We said that 50% or more of the bookings came from customers refilling the tank. Robin alluded to that. But I don't know if you remember, two quarters ago, I was super excited. I had to dig very deep to find that three customers came and refilled the tank in Q1. In Q3, 362 customers refilled the tank. That's an incredible testimony of the success that Agentforce is having in a very short time frame. Now, the other thing that we've learned is pricing matters. It's very complex. We've gone a long ways. We've had different ways of pricing the product. And now I think we have the whole portfolio of different commercial frameworks to meet customers where they want to be.\nMy favorite one, of course, is the extreme. Those customers that are really determined to become an Agentic Enterprise before their peers in their industry, they realize that the last mile is very hard. They know that Salesforce is the last mile with humans, with the apps, with the data, and the context. They go all in with us. They ask, \"Miguel, we don't want to be trapped here in two or three years because consumption, we used to have 10 different metrics. Make it easy for us.\" We went to them and we told them, \"Listen, give me a flat fee. We'll give you, we'll pull all the power, all the power of Salesforce, including FDEs from Srini, and we will deliver the Agentic Enterprise promise.\" We have actually a point of view for every industry that includes hundreds of agents that have already been defined.\nWe have a database of agents with their roles, with their workflows that they have to trigger on how they configure them. We have the phase one, phase two, phase three. Customers just buy on an ILA. We did 16 ILAs in an agentic enterprise license agreement. In Q3, we have about 100 ILAs in the pipeline. All these are multi-million-dollar deals. It is very exciting that it gives the customer the predictability that they need. Now, there are other customers that are more cautious. I'm going to the other extreme.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nLet's drill in on that. Here we have this enterprise license agreement. We call this agentic enterprise license agreement. When we first started with Agentforce, we were talking about, \"Oh, it's going to be so much per conversation.\" It was this type of pricing, maybe transaction-based pricing, usage-based pricing.\nBut customers have pushed for more flexibility. We've moved fast to that. How has that really hit the market? Explain why that is so important for customers.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nBecause Marc, good question. By the way, you and me came up with the ILA concept when we visited a few customers in Europe, from Unilever to PMI. We had great conversations. We realized that they wanted to move. They wanted to transform, but they were afraid about all these metrics, consumption, etc. So what we are doing now is very simple. We are putting the whole menu of options to them. We also have very successful SKUs that we launched, which are Agentforce for sales or Agentforce for service that are seat-based SKUs. People talk about seat-based versus consumption-based pricing. The reality is there are a lot of customers that want seat-based because seat-based gives you the predictability.\nSo we've sold a lot of seat-based licenses for Agentforce and Data Cloud in Q3. In fact, that SKU has doubled year on year. It's very massive success there. But we also have customers from the beginning that they want to just pay per conversation or per agentic actions. So we have the whole portfolio. And we are meeting, and I love this sentence that Robin illuminated me with a while ago. We are meeting customers where they are. Every customer is a different point of the journey. So pricing is not we put pricing away from the table. And by the way, we also have flex pricing.\nIf customers are now going to the second part of the question, if customers are worried, \"Okay, I don't want to invest here too much because I already have my service agents in the call centers and my salespeople, and what if that reduces?\" We have flex agreements where if you decide that because the future of agentic is human and agents working together. In most companies, humans are also going to increase. But if they decrease in some areas, you redeploy them. But they may not need a license of Salesforce. Well, you can use that payment to Salesforce into credits, into an ILA, or into a seat-based license. So we have the full flexibility. Now, humans and agents, I think you guys always ask the same thing on whether the number of seats is increasing, the price is increasing.\nWell, for our core clouds, we're seeing both increasing, which is exciting. We have the flexibility for customers if they want to move investment from one area to the other. So far, we are seeing that the power of the agentic enterprise is when agents augment humans and they work together side by side with humans.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Marc, a question for you. I remember at the analyst meeting that we had at Dreamforce, you referred to some efforts to kind of get back to the basics within the sales channel in pipeline. I think you had mentioned that the leads were there, but you weren't watering the leads or the seeds were there. You weren't watering the seeds.\nWould love it if you could elaborate on that effort to kind of focus back on kind of back to the basics, lead generation, what impact that has had on the pipeline? Thank you so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOkay. Well, I think that maybe this is our greatest accomplishment of the year. Of course, Srini has done a phenomenal job as well as Steve, and the entire technology team in building Agentforce. There's no question the product is more exciting than ever before. We went through this in detail today. But I think that probably the most exciting thing that we have done this year from my perspective is not only have we delivered this incredible piece of technology, but we've radically enhanced the capacity of the distribution organization at a level that we have not done in years. This is very important, not for this year, but for the subsequent years.\nThis investment that we made this year in capacity is going to pay off across all six segments. I just want you to remember Salesforce sells to companies 0 to 200 employees, 200 to 1,000, 1,000 to 5,000, 5,000 above, the US government, and across our ecosystem or the software industry. To really address all six segments, it's critical for us to have the capacity to do that. Miguel, what is your total capacity increase for the year so far?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nToday, as of today, 23%?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChairman and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAbout 23% capacity increase. Then we do four critical things. Not only have we delivered more capacity, we have, as Miguel said, trained them, enabled them. Obviously, these concepts that we're talking about, agentic enterprise, we've created this. We're envisioning this. We're defining what the future is with this.\nSo we have to enable them and train and give them the ability to deliver that in every one of these market segments. Number two, that core capacity, we have to look at that across every single one of those segments. Several of those segments are delivering mid-double-digit growth at a level that we have not also seen in years. Huge shock to us. And we really think that so many of these segments are just on fire and doing incredibly well. And then three is we have to link the compensation plans of these incredible sellers to these goals, all the goals that you've kind of heard us outline in the script.\nAnd the last thing is we measure the participation of each seller across each segment, across each geo, across every operating unit, and find out why are they selling or why are they not selling this product in this geography in this segment. So it's a radical level of management. I would say that our ability to do that today far exceeds where we were even just three or four years ago. And Miguel, I think, has done a phenomenal job in making that happen. And I think that when we're running the largest Salesforce in the software industry, which is what we have, and the ability to deliver that across all of these segments with what I think is the most competitive piece of software we have ever had across every industry, every geography, across every segment, it's a Herculean task.\nAnd Q3, when you look at these numbers and you saw we were guiding, I think, that we were going to do 9% CRPO growth, and it went to 11% because Miguel crushed it. And I'm really excited about Q4, but especially I'm excited about fiscal year 2027 and fiscal year 2028 because of the capacity increases that we're making now.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, Brad. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect."

Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. With that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Hey, Mike, thank you so much. I'm really excited to get into the call. As you saw, we really had a great quarter to close out the first half of the year with outstanding performance across all of our key metrics, including our revenue, our margin, our cash flow, our CRPO, and even our AI and Data Cloud numbers were all incredible.\nYou know, we outperformed on Q2 revenue with $10.25 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and 9% in constant currency. Miguel's sales team drove incredible momentum. Net new bookings from deals over $1 million grew 26% year-over-year. We closed deals with companies like Dell, Marriott, Eaton, US Bank, Japan Post Bank, Lululemon, and the US Army. Non-GAAP operating margin came in strong at 34.3%, and we outperformed on CRPO with $29.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year.\nThe AI and data product line is up 120% year-over-year. We're on track to close out Fiscal 2026 as a record year, raising our guidance on the low end for revenue, raising on non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow, and we expect to finish with nearly $15 billion in operating cash flow. That's just incredible and a huge raise from the previous quarter. Make no mistake, these results aren't just financial milestones. It's the growth that we are seeing, particularly with Agentforce and Data Cloud.\nIt's proof, and you're about to get into this now as I start to really give you our fundamental organizing principle for the company and what I believe the enterprise software industry is about to become because the Agentic Enterprise, the Agentic Enterprise, the real manifestation of what AI was meant to be, well, that Agentic Enterprise has arrived.\nIn the three quarters since we launched Agentforce, we have now won more than 6,000 paid deals and more than 12,500 overall. 40% of our Agentforce new bookings this quarter came from existing customers extending their investment with Salesforce. It's demonstrating the value that they're getting and how the flywheel is really working. We've seen a 60% increase quarter over quarter in customers who've gone from pilot to production, and they're expanding use cases and scaling consumption.\nThis is just the beginning of the most transformative time in our industry ever. I've never been more excited about anything in my entire career. We're about to get into it. I've spent weeks on the road this summer meeting with CEOs, CIOs, and frontline teams. One thing is extremely clear to me: every single one of our customers is becoming an Agentic Enterprise.\nIt's a huge vision for the future. It's a huge vision for the future of business. And really, it's a huge vision for the future of Salesforce. But this isn't just an upgrade. This isn't simply just some automating some existing business process. These agentic enterprises, well, for Salesforce, it's certainly true. It's a complete transformation. And for our customers, the agentic enterprise is a complete reinvention in many cases of who they are and what their potential is.\nIt's a shift from traditional hierarchies to reshaping the entire company, from busy work to orchestrating workflows, from siloed teams to seamless collaboration, from clicking and routing to natural conversations. And hours are shrinking to seconds. Employees and customers are being augmented. But ultimately, it's about this. It's about humans and agents working together with every decision grounded in trusted data.\nThis is, as I said, what AI was meant to be. I just like to talk about what that Agentic Enterprise means for us at a very high level, how we're going to define it, and then also like to talk about what some of our customers are doing and what we're doing as well. I mean, I think that across our portfolio, we are adding these native agentic capabilities into every single one of our products.\nIn sales, every prospect is finally getting a callback. Agents qualify at scale. Humans close the deal. I mean, let me just get into that for just a minute. Now, our Sales Cloud for years has been an app that thousands, well, millions of salespeople use to manage their sales every single day. But now, riding alongside, every salesperson is an agentic salesperson.\nThat agentic salesperson is calling every single person back. How that relates to Salesforce, well, let me tell you that, you know, well, maybe somewhere between 20 and 100 million people who have contacted Salesforce in the last 26 years, they haven't been called back. It's just because we didn't have enough people. But now, with our new agentic sales, everybody is getting called back. It's a huge breakthrough and something that every company is going to benefit from.\nIn service, well, we've been talking about that now for months. You can see our agents are handling millions of conversations while humans are delivering the empathy and expertise. Well, it's a bigger story than that, where you know that we have delivered in the last nine months about a million and a half conversations just for our own company on our help.salesforce.com.\nAnd you also know that we continue to have thousands of humans who are also delivering their support answers. Well, guess what? The CSAT scores are about the same. In Field Service, agents orchestrate scheduling and logistics, so technicians can focus on solutions. I saw it myself at my home. I have this incredible device from Eaton, one of our large customers, using our Field Service product. And it actually connects my Airstream trailer to my house.\nAnd when the technician comes out to work on it, well, they're able to use the agentic capability to learn as much as possible about the product that I'm using and how to fix it and how to repair it while also managing the traditional system of record that's on the Field Service capability, managing all the Field Service and service operations through the Field Service capability. It's really pretty awesome.\nAnd we've been showing now for a few months, starting at our Tableau conference, the new version of Tableau, where agents surface insights and make recommendations instantly, and where agents and humans are working together to make smarter, faster decisions. One really cool thing, when we look at our marketing product, and I'm sure you know, we do about 11 trillion emails a year to our customers.\nWell, those are all one-way conversations. But now we're demonstrating to our customers and about to release our new email platform that provides every one-way conversation into a two-way conversation. And agents are going to turn these one-way emails into two-way conversations. In commerce, it's the same thing. Agents are giving every seller superpowers and shoppers a personal assistant.\nAnd if you've seen anyone from Salesforce recently, have them show you how we're using Slack as our interface to our own agentic enterprise, where we have dozens of agents with people, apps, and LLMs all in one conversational agentic workspace. It's pretty cool. These agents are operating across apps, departments, and silos, all running off of our Data Cloud, all running off of Agentforce. It's an incredible transformation of our product line, but really of our company, not just of our company, but of our customers too.\nThis is a moment in business that we'll never forget, where every business is becoming an agentic enterprise. If we look out into our customers, we're already starting to see some incredible examples. Let me tell you, DirecTV saved billing reps nearly 300 hours of inquiry handling with Agentforce, and the employee AI agent executed 50,000 actions in a week.\nYou know, I've been working with DirecTV for more than 20 years at Salesforce. I'll tell you, when I wrote that line for the script, it just, you know, kind of occurred to me, wow, I think only about a year ago, we hadn't even started using the word agent or agentic or Agentforce at Salesforce. Here we are talking about one of our largest and most important customers receiving this incredible benefit.\nAmgen, an incredible company, projecting millions in annual savings by cutting call times. PenFed, who we talked about in many scripts that we've had already, projecting millions in annual savings by using Agentforce in its loan underwriting. Our good friends at Under Armour and Kevin Plank, well, he more than doubled his case deflection rate and boosted customer satisfaction by double digits. They did it in under 60 days.\nKind of an incredible thing to see the speed of these deployments in enterprise software. Now, a lot of our employees are excited about Reddit because they've reduced average resolution times from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes. Telepass, well, they've powered more than 275,000 agentic conversations over five months. The way they got it in the script is, we can't believe the speed and growth of these conversations just in the last few weeks.\nIt's a conversation at the management level that they've become one of our fastest-growing Agentforce customers. So it's no wonder we're seeing so many companies build on their initial success. Our good friends in Copenhagen, Pandora, the amazing jewelry retailer, Alex, and an entire team scaled from one agent to three in a single quarter. I'm so glad they're coming to Dreamforce to show everyone exactly what they're doing.\nAnd our friends at Indeed have more than doubled the number of actions taken by their customer-facing agents and added another agent in Slack to drive internal productivity. And finally, I have to mention, because it's kind of an amazing story, you know, that Williams-Sonoma, we've only been live for a few weeks, started with Agentforce powering customer support for just one of their brands.\nI think you know they have like quite a few amazing brands like Pottery Barn, West Elm, and others. Well, now it's rolled out along eight of their brands and as well as agents for other use cases, including a sous chef agent that is helping customers choose cookware and guiding them step by step through recipes. They are finding all incredible new ways to use the Agentforce platform. And they're doing it side by side across their entire Salesforce deployment.\nNow, these are all examples, including Salesforce, of an Agentic Enterprise in action, but it's really about how each company is transforming to become an Agentic Enterprise. None of this is possible without Data Cloud. Data Cloud is the heart and soul of the success of these agents because it is providing the data and the metadata that you need and the context to get the accuracy. You know, we probably have the highest accurate agents in the industry.\nThe way that we're achieving that is through our Data Cloud. It's this Data Cloud, as well as Tableau, MuleSoft, and soon Informatica, all working together to really help our customers to clean and harmonize their data and provide it in a way that can be consumed by our Agentforce platform to provide this level of accuracy.\nI think the data business is probably the most strategic and most important business for Salesforce going forward. Already, it's a $7 billion business. Data Cloud is having a great year. It had a 140% year-over-year growth in customers and 326% growth in rows accessed by Zero-Copy Integration. The usage numbers are really just off the charts. But over half of the Fortune 500 are already on Data Cloud, but it's really just the very, very beginning.\nNow, FedEx, and you're going to see them at Dreamforce. Their Chief Operating Officer, Richard Smith, is coming to be part of my keynote. Well, let me tell you that they've got unified data across all their platforms now with Data Cloud. And the numbers that they're telling us that they're saving, well, I'm not going to take away Richard's punchline from the Dreamforce keynote.\nIt's like numbers I've never heard in terms of the amount that can be saved by technology. And now, if a business customer isn't actively shipping, our own Marceting Cloud campaign is automatically triggered, and sales reps are alerted, and it's all happening through our Data Cloud. And this idea that FedEx has seen a double-digit increase in the percentage of customers who've signed the contract and proceeded to start shipping, it's dramatically surprised them, what has been possible in such a short period of time. And honestly, it's also surprised us.\nNow, I want to mention two areas where we're laser-focused and where the opportunity remains absolutely enormous. And that is public sector, but also a new product category for us, which a lot of you know, ITSM or IT service. Now, let's talk just briefly about the government.\nNow, you already know our government is already our largest and most important customer. It's a multi-billion-dollar customer for Salesforce. We've been driving efficiency, performance, and taxpayer savings for more than a decade. Everybody knows that we run the VA, the Veterans Affairs, and the US Coast Guard, and so many great agencies. But, you know, we're starting to expand what we're doing even more and moving more into these DOD agencies as well.\nThis quarter, we finalized an incredible agreement, another one with the US Army, a Fast Pass that enables Army teams to quickly access and deploy Salesforce. It was a huge win for us. And already, we're helping the Army operate more efficiently, streamlining how they identify and elevate leaders, simplifying congressional reporting, powering Amazon-like marketplace for their tactical gear. I spoke with them yesterday.\nAnd I just, of course, first wanted to thank them for their service. But second, I just wanted to say that it's incredible how they're looking at our technology to really transform their own operations. And now, with Agentforce for public sector and FedRAMP high certification, we're able to sell more to the government than ever before because we're bringing the power of the agentic enterprise directly to the government.\nThe Army is already planning to launch a digital front door for its human resource command, providing 24/7 powered service and support to all soldiers, personnel, and millions of veterans. And we have lots and lots of ideas of where we're going to be able to provide value for the US Army. And in the 21st century, agents just aren't optional. We know that. They're mission-critical.\nWell, there's another area where that's absolutely true, and that's in the world of ITSM and IT service. It's an application area that we just haven't gone to before. But I'm very excited that next month, and you're going to see this at Dreamforce as well, that we're launching our own agentic IT service platform. A lot of our existing customers have been asking for this. We're bringing a whole new level of capability. It's Agentforce, and it's Slack-first. That is, right inside Slack, you're going to be using our agentic IT service capability.\nIt's natively embedded. Our employees already work with zero learning curve. And with agentic IT service, well, every request is becoming a conversation where agents work hand in hand with IT teams, proactively fixing their problems. It's going to be an incredible growth driver for the company.\nBut it's just really another example of how every platform is going to become agentic. And I think we're really excited that we're getting there first. And it's a very democratic platform. A lot of the ITSM products have only served the very highest end of the market with maybe 1,000 customers here or 1,000 customers there. But, you know, the thing about Slack is that it's used by about a million customers worldwide.\nAnd I think all of them are going to be able to benefit from this IT service platform. No one else is delivering this level of agentic capability and digital labor at this scale. Now, we know how to do this because our own first customer for this, well, it's us. We are Customer Zero. And over the last six months, as Customer Zero, we've been doing all of these critical things that I've mentioned.\nYes, yes, we've done the 1.4 million customer support conversations with a 77%, you know, resolution rate. Yes, we have the sales agent that's qualifying prospects and generating pipeline. And yes, over 26 years, we just let too many millions of prospects go untouched. Mea culpa. That was our fault.\nBut in the last seven weeks, this sales agent that we've just built, well, it's had conversations, conversations with tens of thousands of inbound leads, even setting up appointments with human SDRs and helping close deals. And we have it running in customers as well. It's been incredible what the opportunity is. Look, we all know the agentic enterprise is here. We all know the agentic enterprise is the next wave of business. We all know that it's going to fundamentally reshape, rebuild, and recast all of our companies.\nAnd we know that what's going to happen is going to be something that we could never have expected, where humans and agents are going to be working side by side. And look, Salesforce is going to lead the way. There's no question about that. You know, we've built the software infrastructure for the agentic enterprise.\nWe have our metadata platform unifying our apps, our data, and agents into one powerful agentic operating system. We are rebuilding every single one of our products to be agentic. We're delivering almost every single one of those products at Dreamforce. And at Dreamforce, you're going to see all of these products. You're going to see hundreds of customers that have deployed these products.\nYou're going to hear directly from leaders like Dell, FedEx, Accenture, Smartsheet, Williams-Sonoma, Pfizer, OpenAI, Anthropic, and so many others about how they are becoming agentic enterprises and using our Salesforce agentic operating system. You know, it's a funny thing. I don't think in the last earnings call, I guess maybe if you go back a year ago, like, was I even talking about agentic or Agentforce or agents?\nAnd now, if you talk about the agentic enterprise, it's another layer above that. So you're going to see that we are rapidly moving to what the next generation of technology is. And at Dreamforce, you're going to see incredible new capabilities, like I said, not just the ITSM product and all these new platforms. You're going to see Agentforce version 4.\nWell, it's going to be amazing, and you're not going to want to miss it. It's going to be 14 October through 16 October in San Francisco. We have an incredible show put together. We've even got a great concert for our children's hospital put together with Metallica and Benson Boone. We've got some amazing surprises for our keynotes. But you're going to just see the future of technology.\nAnd let me just say this. At Salesforce, we've always believed that business is the greatest platform for change. You know, we believed that when it was in the world of mobile and social. And we believed that before, you know, there was AI. You know, that was true in the cloud. Well, you know, the agentic enterprise for us is just not about efficiency or growth. It's about making a positive difference in the world.\nIt's one of our core values at Salesforce, from helping companies serve their customers to driving sustainability to supporting communities. This transformation is grounded in our purpose and in our values. You're going to see all of that at Dreamforce as well. Okay. Well, I'm really excited to have all of you on the call and answer your questions. Now over to Robin.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nPresident and Chief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. As Marc shared, we closed the first half with strong momentum and are on track for a record year. We're delivering customer success, executing with discipline, and setting ourselves up to accelerate profitable growth. The agentic enterprise is here, and we know this firsthand. As Customer Zero, our own sales, service, and Slack agents are augmenting teams across the company, transforming how we work and driving operational excellence.\nWe're also helping our customers like Lennar, Vonage, Booking, and Pearson become agentic enterprises. They're trusting Salesforce to unify their data, apply real-time contacts, and securely deploy agents that automate routine work, streamline operations, and elevate every customer interaction. That is why data cloud and AI, ARR, continues to scale, reaching $1.2 billion in Q2, growing 120% year-over-year.\nNow, let me give a little bit more context on the strong results for the quarter. As Marc shared, revenue in the Q2 was $10.24 billion, up 10% year-over-year in nominal and 9% in constant currency. This was better than expected, driven primarily by one-time licensed revenue and professional services recognition, as well as strong execution. Subscription and support revenue grew slightly above 9% in constant currency.\nWe delivered another quarter of profitable growth with Q2 non-GAAP operating margin up 60 basis points and GAAP operating margin up 370 basis points, marking a 10th consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended Q2 at $29.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and 10% in constant currency. This was also better than expected, driven by sales execution, particularly in creating close, SMB, and big deals.\nAs you know, we've built a resilient business with a diversified portfolio of products and a customer base across various geographies, segments, and industries. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong new business growth in the US and pockets of EMEA, particularly the Netherlands and Switzerland, while the UK and Japan were constrained. From a segment perspective, we continue to see strong performance in our small and mid-market business this past quarter.\nFrom an industry perspective, technology, comms, and media perform well, while retail, consumer goods, and public sector remain measured. These results reflect our disciplined focus on the three strategic priorities I laid out last quarter. I'll walk you through our progress on each. First, we focused on delivering customer success and accelerating data and AI adoption. Customers continue to trust Salesforce for their most mission-critical workflows.\nIn fact, service and platform were in all of our top 10 wins, and 70% of our top 100 wins included five or more clouds. Further, building on that solid foundation, data and AI products were in 60 deals greater than $1 million. Our consumption model is showing strong early success. I want to underscore what Marc just talked about. More than 40% of our Data Cloud and Agentforce bookings this quarter came from existing customers expanding their investment.\nAgentic AI and data make the capabilities of our unified platform, the information, the logic, and the workflows more important and valuable than ever before. We are making it even easier for new customers to get started. Last month, we announced new flexible payment options for Agentforce, including pay-as-you-go, to lower the barrier to adoption and encourage experimentation. Following their launch last quarter, flex credits now account for 80% of Agentforce Q2 new bookings.\nAs Customer Zero, our internal deployment is key to our second priority, operational excellence to maximize shareholder value. In Q2, we expanded 24/7 instant support to six new languages, which, combined with English, now cover over 94% of our global case volume. Earlier this year, we launched our IT and HR agents in Slack to support our employees. In July, we launched dozens more specialized agents in Slack.\nWe believe that being Agentforce is a key driver of our own long-term margin expansion. As part of our lean Agentic Enterprise transformation, we're making smart trade-offs as we manage our portfolio of products and end markets. We are reallocating resources and ruthlessly prioritizing our investments to accelerate data and AI adoption and drive further growth. Finally, all of this is underpinned by our third priority: maintaining a responsible capital allocation strategy.\nOur strategy is simple: make disciplined investments to fuel profitable growth and maintain a balanced approach of return of capital to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Leveraging our responsible M&A framework, we are making strategic investments that accelerate our Agentic roadmap. In the last few months, we closed the acquisitions of Convergence AI, Bluebirds, and Y, and entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Regrello, bringing in key talent and technology to accelerate our innovation.\nThese assets will unlock valuable new data and agentic capabilities for our customers. Also, a quick update on Informatica. We now expect Informatica to close in the Q4 of FY 2026 or early in FY 2027. At this time, given the variability and potential closing timing, we have not included any contribution from Informatica in our guidance. And on capital return, in Q2, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nThis brings our total capital returned since the program began to nearly $27 billion. And today, I'm pleased to announce that our board has approved a $20 billion expansion of our share repurchase authorization. So finally, let's get into guidance. We are pleased to raise the low end of our fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance to $41.1 to 41.3 billion. This results in growth of approximately 8.5 to 9% year-over-year in nominal, and 8% in Constant Currency.\nOn foreign exchange, we now expect a $300 million tailwind, up $50 million since our last print. We are reiterating our subscription and support revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by the momentum in Data Cloud and Agentforce this year. This is partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce, and slower growth in our subscription base.\nWe are pleased to raise our non-GAAP operating margin 10 basis points to 34.1% for the year, building on the continuous improvement from the last few years, and aligned with our ongoing commitment to long-term margin improvement. We now expect GAAP operating margin of 21.2%. This is inclusive of additional restructuring charges. We are also raising our annual guidance on operating cash flow growth to 12 to 13%. This is driven by cash tax savings as a result of the recently enacted tax bill.\nWe now expect CapEx of slightly below 2% of revenue, resulting in free cash flow growth of 12 to 13%. Turning to Q3 guidance, revenue is expected to be $10.24 billion to 10.29 billion, up 8 to 9% year-over-year in nominal and 8% in constant currency. CRPO growth for Q3 is expected to be slightly above 10% year-over-year in nominal, including a $300 million FX tailwind, resulting in slightly above 9% constant currency growth.\nAs a reminder, while we have seen more normalized bookings growth recently, CRPO will continue to be impacted by the cumulative effect of the measured sales performance that started in Q2 fiscal year 2023. In closing, we continue to deliver strong results, and by investing with discipline, we are positioning ourselves incredibly well for the agentic future.\nWe're excited to share more about our product strategy and how we are delivering the Agentic Enterprise at Dreamforce in October. I look forward to seeing many of you there. I'll turn it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Robin. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin Q&A. For today's session, we will be utilizing the raise hand feature. If you'd like to ask a question, simply click on the raise hand button at the bottom of your screen. Once you've been called on, please unmute yourself and begin to ask your question. Please limit to one question. Thank you. We will now pause a moment to assemble the queue. Your first question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. One for you, Marc.\nA debate that has surfaced lately is, has SaaS outlived its long run? Tech cycles have rarely lasted this long. So how defensible is SaaS, particularly the category that you're in within SaaS, against disruption from AI-native apps and maybe custom-built AI? And one, if I could sneak one for you, Robin, Data Cloud and Agentforce showing triple-digit growth. When does that inflate the top line? Thank you so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nWell, thanks, Kash. I think that you're absolutely right. The software industry is going through a tremendous transformation, and it's really driven by kind of the fundamental acceleration of artificial intelligence. Now, I think you know that Salesforce has been AI for more than a decade with our Einstein platform, but it's really the emergence of large language models that really are giving us a new platform that we can build on and extend our applications with.\nThat idea that all of a sudden, we've been running customer service here at Salesforce, as I mentioned, since we started 26 years ago on our own app. What that meant was that there were humans, about 6,000 of them or 7,000 or 8,000 or 9,000, whatever the number is. Well, those humans, they're there working on the application, and they are adding to it, changing it, working with it, and so forth and so on, resolving cases, talking to customers, and also posting information on our website and helping customers to find new ways to resolve their issues.\nThen all of a sudden, this year, we've now built an incredible new capability called Agentforce. By building that capability, there is an agent, kind of an incredibly intelligent piece of software that's also now directly working with the customer.\nSo we have humans working with the customers like we have, and now also agents. And it's not just at some small scale. It's actually at a large scale. In the last nine months, about a million and a half conversations happened directly with these agents, and a million and a half of these conversations happened with humans.\nAnd so it's those apps, and it's the agents working together. Now, it's not the agents have completely taken over the customer support channel. It's Salesforce. It's just not possible because AI, as we all know, these large language models only have a certain level of accuracy, and it's not 100%.\nIt's probably about in the 90s when it really gets well architected with our Data Cloud and with all the different kind of capabilities and kind of really advanced techniques that we've come up with to make our AI as accurate as it can. And so by doing that, yes, there's a lot that we can resolve automatically through the agents with the customers, but there's also a lot that cannot be resolved, and that has to be escalated to the humans.\nAnd so it's humans and agents working together to satisfy customer success. And this is what has been extremely important. And it's all built on this huge data fabric, which is really our Data Cloud, our Metadata, and really our system of record that we've built up with our customers over two and a half decades.\nThat's about the 200 or 300 petabytes of information that we manage for our customers. Now, that metaphor for sales, for service, well, that's also now happening for sales as well. As I mentioned, with this incredible new robotic salesperson that's out there calling back every single one of our leads, setting appointments, and even, in many places, closing deals.\nIt's going to be true in every application we made. It's not about the fundamental, oh, I would say, elimination of SaaS. What I would say is the fundamental extension of SaaS. I think that the fever that we have around this, well, maybe this is why we're one of the first companies at scale to not only deliver these solutions, but use these solutions.\nI guess when I look at the other large enterprise software companies and I look at their websites and I look at how the capabilities that they're providing in terms of kind of same old FAQ systems and this kind of thing versus what we've done at help.salesforce.com, well, I'd say we're way ahead. I think we have a very crystal clear vision about what the future of enterprise software looks like and how we're going to be able to help customers achieve a level of success.\nOver the weekend, I read that MIT study that's becoming very popular, which really goes to show that a lot of companies have thought they were on the right path with generative AI, building their own models, doing it themselves, hooking it all up. Now they're claiming about 94% of those projects have failed.\nWell, we've been saying that was going to happen for the last several years, as you know. But that's not what our customers are saying. Our customers are saying that they're getting phenomenal results and that they have humans and agents working together to create a new level of customer success, or, as we say at Salesforce, an Agentic Enterprise.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nPresident and Chief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah, maybe to add to that, Kash, to your point, how should we think about revenue growth acceleration? I'll add to Marc's excitement. We really do see this as the opportunity to define the Agentic Enterprise. And I'd say we're really starting to harvest the benefits of the investments that we've made in our products. We're continuing to double down on innovation, as I talked about, and we're placing bets in all the right areas: net new AOV, deployment of agents with FDEs, and our AE capacity and growing areas.\nI think one of the things we report to you are cloud revenue on a quarterly basis for transparency, but we're really evolving our pricing and our go-to-market strategy. So yes, it is early days in the adoption cycle, but we're really confident in our strategy to monetize AI. We're focused on capturing the value for our customers. And I'd say we're really optimizing for usage of our platform. We believe this will unlock deeper value across all of our core products over time.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kash. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And, Marc, I really agree with your characterization of the extension of SaaS versus the elimination of SaaS.\nalmost seems like the market has a little bit of a mischaracterization of what generative AI is, thinking of it as a category versus a big extension of capabilities. I think Salesforce is showing their ability to deliver those capabilities.\nOne of the stats that you talked about in the quarter was the 60% increase in pilots to production. Was there some technology catalyst or some implementation catalyst that caused that increase of conversions of the pilot projects into production? If so, what was that? And any color you could give us on what that looks like, what a production deal is going to look like around Agentforce versus what you've been seeing in the pilots?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nI'd really like to call on Miguel and Srini to kind of give you some real insights into what's going on in the field with our customers because I think it'll really illuminate for you some of the real-life examples that kind of get to kind of what you're trying to point out. Srini?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nPresident and Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah. So I think this is a great question. One of the things which we have been working very closely with our customers using our forward deployment engineers and motion and what we have been working and customers are at different stages, like some are in pilot, some are in production, and doing multiple agents. And as we are learning, we are figuring out with our customers a lot of gaps in how they think about their product.\nThey all try to do it, they do it themselves, and they're realizing that you can't write code away to enterprise reliability and security. And that's why you hear a lot of customers or you hear a lot of news about pilot purgatory. But some of the special things we had to do in the product. So for example, we worked with Equinox, and we learned that for their brand image, the gym company, they had a lot of UI treatment, specialized branding, and we added it in the product.\nThen we are working with customers like Lennar and Adecco, where most of these places where the engineers were caught in what I call the prompt doom loop, where people are trying to write prompts and write prompts, and anybody who's an AI engineer will tell you it's very frustrating, and you do it.\nSo one of the things we had to build is determinism in our agents, allowing them to leverage the power of the LLMs in a trusted level. Another thing in our own deployment, as we get to that, is at the entry level. But as you go to real scale, initially, when we did help.salesforce.com, we would have to look at every answer the agents are doing and hand-tune it and understand it. But as you're trying to understand millions of such requests, you cannot do it.\nSo we had to build in the product what we call Agentforce Command Center to enable observability and track it and performance manage, if you will, the agents in a scaled way. So I think this is why we are seeing, as the statistics says, 40% of our revenue is coming from existing customers increasing their consumption.\nThey're really seeing that, hey, I got the first version. So a series of tactical, practical features with a very close loop with our customers and hardening, deep integration with our Data Cloud and platform, really increasing the scale. And then that's just some engineering, customer success cycle, and the product adoption cycle. And then, of course, we have our field teams under Miguel who are now trying to take this to market at different customers. And I'll pass it to Miguel to add his context.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and Chief Revenue Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah. So thank you, Srini. And thank you for making also Agentforce much faster to implement. Listen, let me take this back for a couple of seconds to the bigger picture. I just turned 57 last week. I'm approaching 34 years of professional career. And I don't think I've ever been this excited about our industry and the opportunity ahead of us.\nThe key is, and going back to Kash's question and also Keith's comment on the extensibility of these new AI capabilities, the key is with our core apps, which are nothing other than deterministic workflows that humans use every day. Our Data Cloud, which is the single source of truth that humans and agents need to access, and our Agentforce agentic capabilities that are natively built in the apps and with the data, everything running on the same metadata language that humans and agents understand.\nThis is the only one, the only way to scale AI. So let me give you a couple of examples. I mean, Marc alluded to DirecTV, incredible business value. This is one of the biggest flex credit customers that we have globally. They went from pilot to production in just two months in a very complex environment. They run all our applications.\nTwo things that are worth noting is they leverage Data Cloud at speed, all the billing information from their backend systems through MuleSoft going to Data Cloud. And then, of course, all the 10,000 agents are working on Service Cloud. So that's a great example. Another example, which is funny because we've already talked about them, but the story is just getting better. It's Falabella. It's the largest retailer in Latin America.\nTheir main use case, they have several, but the main use case is where is my order. And they solve that question to the customers across the web, in-app, and WhatsApp. The pilot took two months from idea to production. They access their OMS system. They leverage the CRM data in Salesforce, knowledge articles that they put in Data Cloud. They connect Data Cloud to GCP, and the value is extraordinary.\nThe MPS has increased by 10%, 10 points from 70 to 70%. All the digital interactions, most of them, 70% of them have shifted to WhatsApp, and the call volume has dropped by 25%. But the very cool piece of the story here is they started being a decent multi-hundred thousand customer.\nThen in May, they came back to refill the tank, and they nearly tripled the business on Agentforce. And now we are discussing again to double. And the whole thing predicates on the fact that we are the only platform, the only software infrastructure that can bring the deterministic workflows, the data, and the agentic reasoning and actioning on the same platform. And this is very exciting.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nSo I'd just like to summarize that. I just want to kind of come back to Kash's comment.\nAnd Keith, I think your comment is so insightful, but especially when you put it together with Kash, which is like we are seeing one of the greatest transformations in software, the idea that we're moving from that enterprise software is just for human beings to where it's also having an agentic layer, and that together it's more powerful to serve customers, and that it can create enterprises that are much lower cost, much more efficient, much more capable, and much more powerful.\nAnd it's against this strange narrative that's out there that somehow enterprise SaaS or apps or something are going away. Now, I guess nothing lasts forever, okay? But I just look at how I'm running my own business and the business of our customers. I don't understand what the replacement is.\nSo I just look at this incredible next-generation transformational capability, and I'm going to lay it all out at Dreamforce. And by the way, my keynote, I kind of threw away all my slides, and I said, let's just have 12 CEOs of the largest companies on the planet just show you exactly what they're doing with this technology because it's crystal clear what the value proposition is.\nBut to hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth. And I think this is what really gets down to the part and parcel of it all, which is we are in the greatest transformation of our industry, which I characterize as the Agentic Enterprise.\nBut the idea that there is, I'll just say, again, an AGI, that seems like a fantastical term. I know it's coming in the next week or two, evidently. But this idea that there's some kind of AGI that's about to take over the whole world, well, let me just help everybody understand that's not exactly what's about to happen, that we have this incredible capability, which is the large language model, which is the next step in artificial intelligence.\nAnd yes, we have been able to find what we think is the perfect synergy between the large language model and enterprise software, which we call the Agentic Enterprise or agents.\nThis idea that you can deliver an Agentic Enterprise and you can do what we did, which is reduce your support heads and have an agentic layer and have a more efficient company and make more money and do better for your shareholders and also deliver a better experience for your customers and for your employees, well, that's what we're doing at Salesforce. Some of the other nonsense that's out there, I just cannot get my head around. By the way, I take everything very seriously.\nSo when somebody makes some big comment, I'm like, all right, well, I'm going to go out there and really look at that because I guess AGI is going to happen tomorrow, so I'm ready for that. Or, oh, I really see, okay, well, SaaS apps are going to, well, I'm going to go away and I get, well, I'm going to go check that out. But there's so much nonsense. You got to separate the forest from the trees. Or for those of us who are kind of Bible readers, maybe we separate the wheat from the chaff.\nAnd I'll just tell you, as we separate the wheat from the chaff, just know there is truth out there, and you have to go out there and really find it. And the truth is always with the customers and also right here at Customer Zero.\nAnd I plan to lay it all out for you at Dreamforce as well on 14 October.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOutstanding. Really looking forward to it.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith.\nAll right, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Marc, with the $20 billion addition to the buyback, there's questions about the strategy of leaning harder into the buyback and the balance of M&A. And I guess, does this signal that you're leaning harder towards the buyback, or do you feel like you can do both M&A and the buyback? Just curious to get your thoughts. You have been doing higher frequency of deals, and I think everyone would love to hear your perspective on what this means.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Well, I think, and let me give you my vision, and then let me turn it over to Robin on execution.\nI think at a high level, the most important thing is that we deliver extraordinary cash flow. That's number one. I think we are delivering extraordinary cash flow for an enterprise software company. I think one of the highest in the industry of any enterprise software companies. While a lot of software companies and others have just thrown their cash flow away to go build data centers or do I don't even know what with their money, but I'll just say that we are going to do three things with our money.\nOne, we are going to provide a buyback, just like you said, because I think that is a great idea. We are also going to provide a dividend, which I think is also a great idea. We're also going to use it to look around.\nIf we see great entrepreneurs or great technology or something that we've never seen before that just blows our mind, we're going to buy it. We saw that a couple of times even during our quarter. You've heard this word Regrello, which is a word probably no one's ever heard before. We've been talking to them for almost a year.\nWe know them because the CEO of Regrello and Srini used to work together at Oracle. The president of Regrello used to work here at Salesforce. And so we've been tracking this company. Then our customer Dell took their supply chain and automated 20,000 users using Regrello, and that got our attention. Then we saw our customer Mercedes start to implement it as well. Then we're like, what exactly is going on? They started building an agentic supply chain.\nAnd when we saw the technology, we said, oh, wow, this might even be bigger than agentic supply chain. And we just couldn't get our head around how they were doing exactly everything they were doing. And it took us about nine months of due diligence. And then finally we said, well, we think we're going to buy Regrello. And we just love this company.\nAnd there's other little companies that we found. You heard that word, Bluebirds. And there's other little things out there that we've seen. But when you have $15 billion of cash flow in one single year like this year, and I think you know next year is going to be bigger, that we plan to use it in a smart way.\nI think that that trinity of using it for buybacks, using it for dividends, and also using it to provide inorganic innovation is the right idea and a balanced framework, which is the one that we've laid out in previous earnings calls. I think we're executing it super well. I think you also know we even have this super strategic acquisition that's getting teed up that we've been talking about now for several quarters to bring in because, look, every single customer is going through every AI transformation as a data transformation.\nIt's not really spoken for some reason by others. But if you don't have your data right, you don't get your AI right. So we all understand that. We think that every customer is going to need an Informatica. Every customer is going to need a MuleSoft.\nEvery customer is going to need a Data Cloud. Together, we think that's called the AI Foundation. That AI Foundation is the Data Cloud plus MuleSoft plus Informatica. If you are going to roll out Agentforce, you're going to need an AI Foundation made up of those three things. That all comes out of thinking about cash flow. I think that we have clarity around where we're going. Robin, why don't we talk about exactly how you're going to execute that?\n\nRobin Washington\n\nPresident and Chief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think you summed it up well, Marc, in terms of the trinity. We're balanced. We have a disciplined M&A framework. We're going to be opportunistic. We've clearly made a big bet on Informatica. That's our large acquisition.\nBut as you said, we're going to be, particularly as it comes to the agentic stage, if we see other things out there that make sense, we're going to buy them. Our strong free cash flow allows us to do that. But we also will stay disciplined relative to returning value to shareholders. Maybe we'll move to the next question, Mike.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Kirk Materne at Evercore.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nYeah, thanks very much. I think this one's either from Marc or Miguel, but there's two quarters in a row. You've mentioned the create and close business has been pretty strong.\nAs we think about AI doing more work on the behalf of customers, I was kind of curious just as your view of whether the mid-market becomes more of a source of durable growth for you all as we look out over the next few years. Marc, you mentioned that in relation to the ITSM opportunity. Just kind of curious about what you're seeing in the mid-market and if this can sort of be a more expansive opportunity for you all as we look out. Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nWell, I really appreciate that question. It's very much a corridor strategy and has been for 26 years, but we don't really talk about it as aggressively as we should. So I think there might have been a point of confusion.\nSo let me just help provide some clarification, which is that unlike other enterprise software companies, we're extremely committed to what we call our five-segment strategy. The five-segment strategy, maybe six, I'll say, but let's say our five-segment strategy, and I'll lay it out in what six is, but really it's a five-segment strategy: number one, hey, we love enterprises. We love the biggest enterprises.\nWe use a lot of big enterprise names, Fortune 100 names on this call. We love those customers. They're great. We love them. They're very profitable. It's a fantastic segment to be in. But it's not the only segment of business. Small and medium business, which are kind of like 0 to 200 employee companies, we're extremely strong in. We always have been.\nWe have products that are extremely relevant for them, including our sales and service products, and core products, but even Slack and others. The SMB 0 to 200 business is way stronger right now than we've ever seen it. I think that part of the reason why that is is because AI makes every entrepreneur a super entrepreneur. And AI makes every SMB business look more like a mid-market business.\nSo all of a sudden, you move from the 0 to 200 segment into the next segment, which, call it, 200 to 2000 or 200 to 3000 employees. But as you kind of get into that next segment of the business world, these are businesses that are starting to grow up, have real revenue, need real systems. They look like real companies. They don't have tens of employees. They have hundreds of employees. They have now thousands of employees.\nThose companies, they need real software too, but they don't have CIOs. They don't have DIY. They need prepackaged software. They're not really dealing with the hyperscalers or the large-scale SIs. They're dealing with us. We are their hyperscaler. We are their software hyperscaler. They look to us as a company like that they might look to a super big company might have every option. These companies don't have every option. This is a huge segment of the market.\nThe next part of the market is kind of the traditional we call general business market or high-end of the mid-market business, which could be like anywhere from a couple thousand employees to maybe five or six thousand employees. This also is an extremely fast-growing part of the business. Now, I cannot tell you why, but we see it.\nMiguel and I talk about it almost every day, that not only SMB business, but this mid-market and general business is growing super fast. When I talk to my friends who run the large SIs, I've been encouraging them to move their business downstream to serve these companies that have single-digit thousands of employees.\nSo that is in the 1 to 10,000 employees. Because what happens is all of a sudden, when you get into the next segment, which is segment, call it segment four, you get into the big boys, the big companies, the Fortune 100, 200, Fortune 500 companies who have the tens of thousands of employees. They have maybe more options and bigger budgets. It's very exciting when you close one of these because you end up with some kind of mega transaction.\nBut they're going through a lot of transformation because they're being pitched a lot of different technology right now. A lot of it is fantasy land. But just, it's all going to play out in its own way in segment four. In segment five, it's the government. I think we all know that the government has been going through something that none of us have ever seen before in the last six months.\nWe all understand the DOGE revolution. We're all watching that closely. And that is something that we're all now; the government is coming out of and is starting to acquire, like we talked about our U.S. Army transaction on the call. Segment six is really ISVs. Every ISV and ecosystem is going through a huge transformation as well.\nWe see that in our AppExchange, but we probably have the most vibrant ecosystem in the world, which is Slack. If you haven't been on Slack to see what's happened on Slack, it's not just the ecosystem. All these next-generation AI companies ranging from OpenAI to Anthropic to everyone are on Slack. And it is incredible how they've used that as their operating system and as their platform to run their companies.\nAnd then we're really bringing all of our core products down into Slack so that everything is Slack first. It's a term I used in the script. The idea that you'll be able to start Sales Cloud and start Service Cloud and all of our products, even our new ITSM product from Slack first, and then move up. And I think that's very exciting.\nYou'll see all of that play out at Dreamforce as a lot of that gets released in our October release. And Miguel, do you want to just fill in what I'm talking about?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and Chief Revenue Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah. Well, Kirk, you asked Marc's favorite question. Thank you for that. But listen, we are adding a lot of capacity to our business, AI capacity. At the end of Q2, we had added 20% more AIs than we did last year. Obviously, it takes six to eight months for those AIs to ramp. On the low end of the market, actually, they ramp faster. But we have a mantra that is grow what is growing. And today we see that the low end of the market and the mid-market is growing significantly. And it's growing significantly for two reasons. One is these customers want to become agentic enterprises.\nAnd they don't have chief digital officers. They don't have CTOs. They don't have the complexity. They need a trusted partner where they bring the data, they bring the AI embedded in the applications, and they're buying faster than anything we've seen. We also made some organizational changes. We brought the old Salesforce model back. We brought people to hubs. We hire faster. We enable faster.\nThe second reason it's growing a lot is because AI is creating more small and medium companies. So that opportunity is huge. And that's why we're investing significantly. We're investing significantly more in the mid and low end of the market than we're investing in the high end of the market. We're also growing double-digit in capacity in the high end of the market.\nBut by the way, there are many other areas where we are investing and that we are seeing are having already impact in accelerating bookings. I see the pipeline into H2. Pipeline is growing in the high teens. And for big deals, it's actually approaching 20% growth. That's a really good sign. We haven't seen that kind of pipeline in a long time. The Agentic Enterprise is really the next incredible investment cycle. And I think we are, as we discussed here, we have the right sovereign infrastructure to monetize this massive opportunity.\nOur innovation keeps giving us. So thank you, Srini. Thank you, Steve. I mean, this is an embarrassment of riches. When you look at the products that we're going to release in Q3, Agentforce, Voice, Tableau Next, Marceting Cloud Next just released recently. We just certified Agentforce and Data Cloud for government.\nThat's going to be a monster opportunity for us. Life Sciences Cloud, we are killing Veeva in many other in their turf. ITSM, Marc alluded to it, Mule Agent Fabric, Partner Cloud. All that is more products for our increased capacity to sell. And I'm not even including Informatica. And new packaging, new pricing to monetize and make it simpler for customers to absorb this amazing innovation.\nAnd as Marc and Robin and Srini said earlier, we have more and more Agentforce and Data Cloud customers. They bring shorter sales cycles. It's create and close. We've closed 40% of the ACV that we closed in Q2 just came from create and close short sales cycles on Data Cloud and Agentforce existing customers. So these are tangible examples of what we're doing now to accelerate the growth.\nAnd obviously, the low end of the market is great, but we are seeing growth everywhere.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kirk.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nOperator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much. Marc, we've heard software companies say that they have held their headcount flat in their support organizations. We haven't heard anyone saying that they reduced headcount by close to 40% there like you have. I'm curious, what do you think is holding other software companies back from seeing that kind of breakthrough?\nAnd then as you repurpose those sales roles into, excuse me, the support roles more into sales roles, what type of firepower do you see that giving you to try to drive some of the incremental top-line growth that you referred to about 90 days ago?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nMark, it's a great question. And let me just say this, number one.\nIn our industry, people always overestimate what you can do in a year and underestimate what you can do in a decade. It's hard for everybody to get their head around what's possible. We're sitting up here at the top of Salesforce Tower. I'm looking at Mount Diablo. If you were at Telegraph Hill and you were at Mama's Restaurant right now, you'd still be in San Francisco, but you wouldn't be able to see Mount Diablo. Maybe we just have a little more clarity from where we sit.\nBut we can see crystal clear that Salesforce has the opportunity to do exactly what you're saying, which is to reduce everybody's support cost, to make everyone's sales organization a lot more productive, to make everyone's marketing have a much higher ROI, to make every field service technician a superman or superwoman, and to make every Slack user far more empowered in their organization than ever before. And I could go on and on and on.\nAnd why others are not doing this yet is, I think, maybe it's threefold. One is timing, like I'm saying. Two, it could just be there's a lot of nonsense, kind of to Kash's point, which I think Kash said it really well, which is like there are very smart people in our industry and other executives who are saying absolute nonsense. And I don't understand why they're saying this nonsense.\nMaybe it's just to create a certain level of FUD in the market. But I think it's inappropriate at this point. What it's done for the whole enterprise software industry, I think, is crazy. I would say the third thing is fear.\nBecause I think with fear, all of a sudden, as soon as you start to say, I'm going to make some dramatic change, but let me make one thing crystal clear, which is that the agentic enterprise, unlike every other kind of technology value proposition that we've kind of prophesized for the last 26 years, the one big difference is not only is it a radical technology transformation, as I articulated, humans and agents working together, it's also a radically different organizational transformation involving what the structure of your company looks like.\nYou probably saw that we just put out a press release that we're restructuring our company. Everyone's like saying to me, why are you doing that? What are you doing about this? What are you doing about that? You're making this change. Yes, we're taking out poor performers. We do that every year. But we're doing something else that's much more important. We're becoming an agentic enterprise.\nWe realize that the opportunity at hand for us and for everyone and for everyone on this call is to build a radically new kind of company, a more profitable company, a higher revenue company, a company with better performing marketing programs, more productive employees, much more augmented customer opportunities, and employee opportunities.\nThis idea that we're going to radically impact and change how companies are shaped and operate, that we're not just going to build the software, it's the software and it's the structure. I've been on the road for eight weeks. I'm just back after meeting with hundreds of customers, primarily in Europe. In each and every single one, it's a complex transformation, not just from the software side, but also from the human management, or we call change management side.\nI'm sure you're all familiar with the term change management. So I'll just tell you, I was with one of our customers that I love, which is Adecco, which is this incredible recruiting company. They're sitting with the CEO and they're in France. Miguel is with me and we're having a great conversation.\nThe CIO is from Switzerland, and we're all sitting there, and each person is from a different part of Europe. We're having a very robust conversation, but they're rebuilding their whole business model, their technology model. They're rebuilding their whole company around this idea. In another case, we then drove to Schneider, who's been a customer of ours for like, I think, 20 years.\nWe've known three or four Schneider CEOs. I met the new CEO, Olivier. He's amazing. I had dinner with him in Dubai, and now I'm seeing him again in Paris, and we're just talking about this. I realized my job is to inspire, to energize, to motivate, and to fundamentally show the vision of what is possible for the future of software itself for him.\nFor him, it's really exciting because he not only is going to rebuild his company, but he can also rebuild the software that he builds and delivers to his customers. Then we went up. I got on the plane literally. I'm just recalling my trip in my head right now, up to Amsterdam to talk to some of the banks up there. We went through this Agentic Enterprise vision with our Financial Services Cloud and how we've rebuilt this product.\nAnd I'll swear the CEO and the management team, and the CEO stops me at the end of the meeting and goes, I just want to tell you, this has been a great two hours, but we took our entire board meeting yesterday to only talk about what the potential is for agentic capability at our bank. And I think in each and every case, every company is going to go through this dramatic transformation.\nNow, there will be vendors that lay out what they think is the future. And they could say, Well, we're going to give you this large language model in your. I'm not going to go through the specific different models, but at the productivity level, or we're going to give you just a large language model, or we're going to do this for you. But I haven't found anyone other than Salesforce.\nI will say maybe there's a couple of other peers of ours who then can come in at scale. But I think we're the only ones who have rebuilt every single one of our product lines because I am super passionate that all of our products need to change, all of our customers need to adopt this, and that we are going to do it through a whole different kind of business strategy. And this is just a moment where if you can't feel or see what's about to happen, it is incredible.\nAnd it's not just about some kind of foundation model is now officially taking over every enterprise because I've been to every customer on planet Earth that I haven't seen that. But what I have seen is that, like in my own company, if you haven't seen it, come over.\nI'm going to show it to you myself that you can do things in a company that you could not do before. And it's all possible. And you can do a lot of things. But one last thing. You cannot do everything. And folks that think that you can do everything or that this AGI is this and now AGI is getting recast.\nAGI used to be AGI is, let's say, the AI that basically is able to reinvent itself and build new models on its own. Okay? So anyone who says, now, well, AGI is just a version of a model that can now not only code, but then refactor software. Everyone's trying to recast AGI because of a lot of aggressive comments about AGI from a few years ago. So let's just come back here. That's now being recast as superintelligence.\nThe reality is you can see these large language models are actually hitting the upper limits of their existence. They are themselves finite data sets built on the internet, built on finite sets of algorithms. We can see what those are and what they are not. There's no question about that. Okay? That idea that they're valuable, yeah, you can use them coupled with enterprise software to do some incredible things.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Just to wrap it all up together, if you think about it, you have more sales guys, as Miguel said. The agents should help you to get more productive. What does it tell me about your confidence about the growth outlook going forward? Thank you. Could be a short answer.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think that Miguel was actually putting together a pretty compelling narrative around what we think is happening inside of our own company. You can see it in the numbers if you look closely enough. They're pretty exciting. This is not a company in crisis. This is a company that is accelerating and doing things in new ways, has been going through a huge innovation cycle, is innovating organically and inorganically, and has incredible levels of customer success.\nBut there is something bigger than that. I'll just let Miguel repeat what he said before because it was so subtle, but yet so important because it's our growth ladder and it's our narrative on why we think we're going to see some incredible growth over the next six to eight quarters.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and Chief Revenue Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah.\nI think, Marc, I think, Raimo, you're thinking more about how the booking acceleration might flow through the top-line revenues. Robin already alluded to that. My focus is accelerating bookings. I'm very happy with the execution of my team. I'm very positive about what is coming ahead, not just in H2, but also what is coming in the next fiscal year. We're already thinking about the next fiscal year.\nWe wouldn't be investing at the rate that we are investing with a lot of intentionality in the areas that are growing, in the areas that have higher margin. If we didn't see a great opportunity, we're sitting with Agentforce and Data Cloud in thousands of customers. I'm already seeing customers that have refilled the tank. We call it refill the tank when they come back and buy more data or more Agentforce credits.\nThere is a customer that in just three or four months, they refill the tank three times. I gave you the example of Falabella. When we have thousands of customers and we're going to have billions of agents working, this is digital labor at scale, working in thousands of companies, just consuming, just operating, just driving value to the customers. And customers are going to need more credits, more fuel. And I see a bright future. The bookings are very strong, and I'm very confident in the future of the company.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO, and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Raimo.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. Yeah. You too.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nI appreciate everyone joining the call today. And I want to remind everyone to tune into our product innovation webinar on Friday. We'll have a session focused on Agentforce adoption and Customer Zero. Look forward to seeing you all then and over the coming weeks. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining."

With that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Hey, thanks so much Mike. Really appreciate everything you're doing. Before I get into all these exciting highlights from the quarter, there's so much to talk about. I just want to say a few words about Informatica, and I'm sure everybody knows I love Informatica. I've been working with this company since probably 2006.\nSohaib Abbasi, a former CEO, last night sent me a photo of me and him together at their user conference, and I'm so excited that we have signed this definitive agreement to acquire them for $8 billion, which upon close is going to unite our number one AI CRM and of course their number one AI, MDM, and ETL and bringing these things together. Well, I couldn't be more excited about this acquisition. I know that many people on the call know Informatica so well, just like I do.\nYou may not know everything that's happened with Informatica. I've followed it very closely. The way they've rewritten their product into the cloud, their incredible engineering leadership, especially some of their incredible new engineering data engineering centers, and what they've built is just awesome. I'll tell you that there's just few technology companies I've just been more impressed with.\nIn fact, we're a customer, we're a partner, we're an investor in Informatica. We really love the company, we love the people, we've loved the leadership. I have to say we probably spent the last 20 years discussing how to bring the companies together. We spent a lot of time not only with their new CEO, but Amit, who's fantastic, but with their engineering teams. I even sent our group over to India to see what they were doing there.\nIt all led really to this incredible moment. It's an awesome acquisition for us. It's a transformational step. It's a great price for the company, this transaction. I think that Robin will get into this, you know, because we've been very focused on staying, you know, really in our, you know, acquisition framework.\nWe spent a lot of time thinking about what is it going to take to buy a company of scale, how much are we really willing to spend? Are we willing to walk away like we did a year ago when numbers are not right? We just want to be as disciplined as possible. look, at the end of the day, I know all of you already know this, but this is a great price for a great company.\nIt's got great multiples, it's accretive, it's non-dilutive, it's coming together in an incredible way. This is a moment where Informatica is more important to our customers than ever before because of what's happening with AI. I think everyone who is going through an AI transformation, every business, including mine, and we're going to talk about some great businesses that are going through transformations, whether it's Pepsi, or Falabella, or OpenTable, etc.\nBut every AI transformation is a data transformation. You don't see it on the consumer side because when you're using a consumer AI, you have to remember that the data set has kind of been prefabricated for you. That is the training data and everything is put together. You know, it's an amalgamated data set applied to this consumer AI model. That's not how an enterprise AI really works.\nYou have to have your enterprise data together to get the result that you want. When you look at these very high functioning agents and we'll talk about, you know, one that we have, we have so many, I mean we've done now 8,000 Agentforce deals. I think we've got 4,000 paid Agentforce customers, $100 million in Agentforce ARR.\nA billion dollars and more than Data Cloud and Agentforce ARR. But when you look at these companies that are doing it right, they have got their data together and that is what is really the key. This ability to unify or harmonize or activate all the data across the entire enterprise. If you can imagine this idea that you want to deploy all of this incredible, you know, agentic data, well, you've got to get your data right.\nInformatica combined with Salesforce's Data Cloud, combined with Tableau, combined with other key assets that we're going to bring to bear, this is what is creating this incredible data business. I mean, you know, we have big goals for what, how the size and scale that that data business can get to. Robin will go through that in detail, and we will really work hard to advance this mission of Informatica to make sure that our customers' data is incredible. So anyway, let me turn it over to Robin to give her perspective on Informatica, and then we'll get into the quarter.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nChief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nThanks Marc. We're incredibly excited to welcome Informatica to Salesforce upon closing. Our responsible M&A framework that Marc just spoke to is a key pillar of our capital allocation strategy, and it's focused on three areas: customer success and strategic fit, acceleration, and value.\nOur acquisition strategy is methodical; it's patient, and it's decisive, targeting transformative assets like Informatica when the calculus aligns to maximize customer success. You already heard from Marc on why this will be a critical complementary asset for accelerating our growth strategy in data and AI and apps. I'm going to focus on value, our third pillar.\nWe expect to achieve accretion on non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow by year two post close. We are laser focused on speed of integration by leveraging our focus on operational excellence and our M&A integration playbook.\nOur goal is to achieve accretion as quickly as possible, which is a significant evolution in our M&A strategy. In line with recent acquisitions and in line with our M&A framework, we prioritize non-dilutive forms of consideration.\nAs a result of our durable free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet, this deal will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt resulting in no share dilution. This transaction is not expected to disrupt our capital return strategy inclusive of our share repurchase program, and our dividend.\nFinally, we expect to close by early fiscal year 2027. We view this acquisition as a key enabler for Salesforce's next phase of AI-driven growth and believe it will amplify our market differentiation and deliver sustained benefits for all Salesforce stakeholders. Now back to you, Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right, right on. Well, Robin, thank you so much, and you are doing a fantastic job as our new COFO. So, so great that you're here, and I'm looking forward to you all having the chance to interact with Robin on the call and look at overall. Let's just talk about this.\nWe are just extremely excited to welcome Informatica, and I can't wait to close the deal. You know, I think that this is going to be an absolutely incredible opportunity. So look, let's move on to the quarter. We delivered $9.83 billion in Q1 revenue. That was up 8% YoY. Subscription and support 9% in constant currency. We saw very strong growth in our small and medium market business. It really surprised us. Both of them achieved really strong double-digit new bookings growth.\nWe continue to deliver on these margin goals that we have. We delivered 32.3% non-GAAP margin in the quarter, and we delivered $6.5 billion in operating cash flow. We have $60.9 billion in RPO up 13% YoY. We had exceptional performance with cRPO growing 11% YoY in constant currency. We're raising our fiscal year 2026 guidance by $400 million to 41.3 billion at the high end of the range.\nI mean, sometimes you have a quarter when everything is going right for you. That means, you know, revenue is going right, bookings is going right, you're kicking off the quarter. Q1 is always a high risk quarter, but even currency is moving in the right direction. This was just a great quarter, and that is why we're able to deliver this incredible raise.\nSo few enterprise software companies probably have ever delivered these kinds of numbers. It's kind of even a shock to me that we're delivering this $41.3 billion in guidance. We are now just very well positioned to take advantage of this multi-trillion-dollar opportunity in AI, enterprise software, and digital labor. Now in just two quarters, we are also.\nSince we launched Agentforce, you think about that. We now have more than 4,000 paid deals, as I mentioned, more than 8,000 in total across every industry. We've got 800 customers already in production with Agentforce, including amazing companies like ENGIE. That has been a success, incredible success, success story with incredible velocity and conversations, and OpenTable, Finnair, Grupo Globo, Falabella.\nWe've talked about so many of these; we're going to talk about so many more. We have launched hundreds of pre-built Agentforce templates for different industries, roles, staffs, making it faster and easier for customers to deploy Agentforce. We're learning a lot about how to make agents successful, productive, how to scale, how to tune our own organization, and really get our customers all ready for this AI transformation in the enterprise led by agents.\nNow earlier this month we introduced our Flex Credits. It's the new consumption-based pricing model. That's how we've tuned our pricing after a huge amount of customer feedback. Next month we're going to add FedRAMP High authorization for Agentforce. So the US public sector can also experience this incredible success. So no one else is delivering what we think digital labor is at this scale.\nNow of course Agentforce does agentic augmentation for employees. Agentforce is also, you know, doing it directly to consumers. I think that we are really delivering at this point probably more agents and more conversations, and more capability to more enterprises than any other vendor in the world. I really see us as the number one agent platform already, and it's only been a few months. In fact, Agentforce reached more than 100 million in AOV.\nIt's much faster than any product in our history. We're not even fully deployed on all geographies, currencies, or languages. To that point, I was in Japan last week and they are, you know, they can't wait to get Agentforce, you know, running in Japanese, which we're about to deliver for them. So the success of Agentforce is building on the strong growth we've seen in our Data Cloud. Data readiness, as I mentioned with Informatica, is critical for every company.\nIn this quarter, our Data Cloud just our Data Cloud surpassed 22 trillion records, up 175% YoY. Nearly 60% of our top 100 deals included investments in both Data Cloud and AI. We are still working really to be able to kind of communicate with every single one of our customers on the importance of Data Cloud.\nYet Data Cloud just remains this incredibly fast moving product. 50% of Data Cloud's Q1 new bookings came from existing customers. I think that's really important because it really speaks to the adoption of the product and the incredible usage by the customers who are, who have it.\nEven though Agentforce is only in its Q2, 30% of its bookings also came from customers, increasing their consumption. Another key point of these two products. Now, these are early days, but this flywheel AI agent, flywheel, it's working. Data Cloud's ARR grew more than 120% YoY. It's more than a billion dollar part of our business. That is amazing. The pace of innovation has been incredible. I've just never seen our company, really, any company, move this fast with a new technology.\nWe've also witnessed how we've pivoted the entire company around our vision for AI. That is the idea that we have these incredible apps, every single one of these apps being rebuilt for this incredible AI revolution.\nThe Data Cloud itself. And not to mention, of course, when you start to look at it, you've got the agentic layer. Don't forget about our metadata platform. I'm going to get into that in a second. But I just think it all played out just last week when we looked at the New York World Tour. I know many of you were there, and you could really feel the energy. 10,000 customers, everyone looking at technology that just a year ago did not exist. And now they are on the very cusp.\nOf a huge transformation for their enterprises. Now, when I talk about agents and data and apps and metadata, that's what we really call our ADAM framework. It's, in our experience, these four elements, the app, the data, the agents, and the metadata that make Salesforce unique. Yet companies need to achieve the real promise of agentic AI.\nYou could really see that also play out when we got to our Tableau conference this quarter. If you were in San Diego, you saw Tableau Next, and what you saw was the DataFam. That's the Tableau community, kind of fully inspired because not only were they looking at Tableau Next, you know, this incredible new product, but what they saw was Tableau, the Tableau they love.\nThey also saw an agentic layer, and they saw it deeply integrated into our Data Cloud and all running on our metadata platform. That's our ADAM Framework. The agents, the data, the apps, the metadata, all together.\nTableau Next is a great example of where we're going with all of our technology in our company, and customers are so excited. Slack is really another example. Slack is, of course, where I believe you're going to really begin and end every Agentforce conversation. It's the conversational interface for managing all of your work across app systems, teams, and Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, Tableau Next. Any Salesforce app can live inside Slack. It's a very fluid, natural user experience.\nI know a lot of you are on Slack, and with Agentforce in Slack, every employee has a digital teammate that can make notes for your meeting, summarize your Slack channels, and you really see like AI taking place on Slack. When you look at Slack Recap or you look at agents just coming right into your channels to talk to you in real time.\nYou can imagine how all of these new kinds of apps that are appearing in the marketplace where AI and agents are all happening. This is this incredible agent user interface with Slack. So in this new agentic AI era, every company is going to say that they have agents. Well, I think every company does say that they have agents.\nBut without these four parts of what we call ADAM, the really the agents, the data, the apps, the metadata framework, you're just not really able to deliver this complete experience for the enterprise, including delivering digital labor. That's why so many customers are achieving success now with Agentforce and so many of our new offerings that are using this incredible combination.\nLet's talk about some customers. Finnair is using Agentforce to help manage customer service for 12 million passengers. Agentforce is already having thousands of conversations a week with Finnair customers. And the airline is aiming to automate 80% of customer service queries and reduced new rep onboarding time by 25% with Agentforce. It's been an incredible success story. And that's not the only airline I think you remember.\nWe've talked about Singapore Airlines and we're talking to so many airlines about how they not only can use all our Customer 360 apps, not just the Data Cloud, not just our Meta Platform, but build this agentic capability around the airline. This is going to be a huge opportunity for that entire industry which is so customer service obsessed.\nNow I have to tell you about this great company, Falabella. For those of you who have ever been to Falabella, you already know. I guess the analog would be, you know, I'm speaking, you know, from San Francisco, so I'll just say it's kind of the Nordstrom of Latin America in some way. This is a Latin American retail conglomerate. It's a great example of why Agentforce is winning. Here's this company that's pioneering Agentforce just a couple of months ago in their Colombia business.\nIt's so successful; they're actually deploying it on WhatsApp, which we hadn't really seen before. They're using WhatsApp. The customers are coming in; they're coming in and hey, what's my order? What's going on? This what's my order use case is the main thing that's driving Falabella. Boom, all of a sudden they go, you know what? This is working so well. We're going all over Latin America. What was kind of, I think, a low six-figure deal, I mean, Miguel is going to have to come in here and tell me; it turned into like a $1 million deal overnight. What?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\n300?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, it was 300, right.For just Colombia.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nit become a millionaire.\nNow it's a million. So that's a great example. And you know, we look at another one, OpenTable. We've been talking about this story for a while, which is Glenn is doing a great job deploying Agentforce. And you know, he started with the restaurants, then he did employees, and now he's like doing the consumers. And this is an incredible thing that OpenTable has been so successful and I'm so proud of Glenn.\nAnd now we see Ramon doing the same thing at PepsiCo where he's trying to bring together, you know, the beverage business and the snack business. He's kind of building a one PepsiCo vision with the Data Cloud. I think he uses 11 clouds, right, Miguel? Is that right? All of them, except every single one. And then delivering a whole agentic layer around PepsiCo is so incredible.\nAnother Latin American success is Grupo Globo. The Brazilian media conglomerate purchased Agentforce in Q4 in less than three months. Agentforce basically boosted Globo's retention rate by 22%, driving revenue upgrades, cross selling, converting non subscribers. It's very cool.\nAnd I guess one of the surprise stories is ENGIE, who's a longtime Salesforce customer, known so many of the CEOs. Amazing company, doing all kinds of great things in the energy marketplace. You know, driven out of Europe and now they're assisting 83% of their users with Agentforce. I think it's, you know, the number of conversations that are happening are some of the highest that we've seen. It's really cool. So, and I've got other stories you know, you've heard me talk already about 1-800Accountant and Smartsheet and so many other customers.\nThis is just the beginning of what's going on with Agentforce, Data Cloud, or Metadata Framework. We can go into it in Q&A if you want. Now I'll turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nChief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nThank you, Marc. I've been in the COFO role for a little over 50 days now, and I've spent that time deeply listening to our shareholders, employees, and customers, and what I've heard has been instrumental in shaping my top priorities for the year ahead, which are delivering customer success and accelerating AI adoption to drive growth, driving operational excellence to maximize shareholder value, and responsible capital allocation.\nWe're already making progress against these priorities. First, let me share a few details on how we're delivering customer success and accelerating AI adoption to drive growth. Our core clouds continue to be a cornerstone of our product portfolio with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and platform in nine of our top 10 wins. More than half of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds, with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in nearly 80% of those deals.\nAs customers adopt more clouds, they unlock the full power of our deeply unified platform with Data Cloud and Agentforce built into every one of our applications. This drives the flywheel of success as well as lower attrition as customers realize the benefits of our platform.\nIt's early days, but the flywheel is already turning. 30% of Q1 Agentforce new bookings came through expansion deals from existing Agentforce customers, and as Marc just shared, our customers continue to invest heavily in Data Cloud to prepare for their agentic future. In Q1, we closed more than 30 net new annual bookings over $1 million that include both data and AI. Tableau was included in more than 70% of our deals over $1 million, and MuleSoft in nearly half of those deals. This underscores how important data is to our customers like Box, Deloitte, and Boeing.\nOur ecosystem plays a critical role in driving customer success and growth. Our partners were included in seven of our top ten deals of the quarter. Today, Salesforce is the fastest growing ISV on AWS Marketplace, which has driven hundreds of transactions for us since launch, including two of our top five deals this quarter.\nFinally, our industry specific solutions continue to deliver significant values to customers like the United States Air Force and University of Chicago Medicine. Nearly half of our top 100 deals included Industry Cloud. Our Life Sciences Cloud had a strong quarter. We've seen incredible momentum with more than 40 global customers including Pfizer and Takeda, which was a Q1 win for us. Takeda will use the Life Sciences Cloud with Agentforce and Data Cloud to unify its data and deploy agents across medical, commercial, and patient care operations, and we are continuing the momentum.\nWe unveiled a brand new next-gen mobile application for Life Sciences Cloud for field reps just last week. As customers adopt more agents, upgrade to premium additions, and leverage our industry solutions, we see greater expansion and stronger customer retention. With data and AI, that value is accelerating, driving even more impactful customer outcomes.\nAs you all just heard, we are innovating faster than ever, and this is a core part of how we will drive operational excellence to maximize shareholder value. We're positioned better to leverage our own innovation to drive efficiency and profitability similar to what our products bring to our customers. Let me give you two great examples. Our sales agent in Slack is transforming how our teams sell. Our AEs have already logged over 21,000 interactions, simplifying everyday sales activity, saving our teams over 44,000 hours annually.\nFurther, Data Cloud is amplifying that impact, cutting lead routing from 20 minutes to 19 seconds in Slack. In customer support, Agentforce has handled 750,000 cases and is on track to surpass 1 million help portal requests this quarter, cutting case volume by 7% YoY\n. As a result, we have reduced some of our hiring needs, enabling us to rebalance and redeploy 500 customer support employees to higher impact data plus AI roles by year end, driving $50 million in savings. Showing what's working for us helps our customers envision their future, and I'm excited to keep scaling these efforts internally. That is the power of Salesforce. On Salesforce, utilizing our own unified platform infused with data plus AI across our enterprise will drive sustained efficiencies and leverage across our P&L. And we are just getting started.\nNow you've all seen the numbers, but let me provide a little more context on the quarter. For the first quarter, revenue was $9.83 billion, up 8% YoY in nominal and constant currency. Subscription and support revenues grew 9% in constant currency.\nAs a reminder, this incorporates a 1 point headwind from the leap year last February. Again this quarter, pricing and packaging continued to be a key lever for us, most notably in sales and service. Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at slightly above 8% in line with recent trends. As we continue to focus on customer success, we are incentivizing on a new metric with our field reps net new AOV, which measures new and renewal performance. Together, this provides a clear view on overall business expansion and enables our teams to focus on overall health of the customer.\nOur business benefits from a balanced portfolio of products and customers across geographies, segments, and industries. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong new business growth in the UK, France, Canada, and Asia Pacific, particularly South Asia, while some pockets in EMEA remain constrained from a segment perspective.\nAs you heard from Marc, we saw strong performance in our small and mid market business this quarter, and from an industry perspective in Q1, comms and media, and health and life sciences performed well, while retail and consumer goods, and public sector were more measured.\nOn operating expenses we continue to focus our investments in sales and marketing, and R&D to drive data and AI innovation, helping fuel Customer 360 and future top line leverage. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows, remaining performance obligation ended Q1 at $60.9 billion up 13% YoY.\nCurrent remaining performance obligation or cRPO ended Q1 at $29.6 billion, up 12% YoY in nominal and 11% in constant currency, which is better than expected driven by strong renewal performance. Q1 operating cash flow was a healthy $6.5 billion, up 4% YoY.\nAs we focus on responsible capital allocation, we are continuing to invest where it matters most to our business and customers while maintaining a clear focus on efficiency and profitable growth to maximize shareholder value. On capital return in Q1, we increased our dividend payout by 4% and returned more than $3 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This brings our total cash return since the inception of our capital return program to more than $24 billion. Finally, let's cover guidance.\nWe are pleased to raise fiscal year 26 revenue guidance to $41 billion to 41.3 billion, an increase of $400 million on the high end driven by foreign exchange tailwinds. This results in growth of approximately 8% to 9 YoY in nominal and 8% in constant currency on foreign exchange. We now expect a $250 million tailwind, up $400 million since our last print.\nWe are reiterating our subscription and support revenue growth of approximately 9% YoY in constant currency driven by the momentum in Data Cloud and some contribution from Agentforce this year. This is partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce, and slower growth in our established base. Our guidance reflects a consistent demand environment and assumes those trends continue. Of course, if the environment changes, our results may be impacted as we continue to drive operational excellence.\nWe are pleased to reiterate our non-GAAP operating margins of 34% and GAAP of 21.6% for the year. Building on the continuous improvement from the last few years, our annual guidance on operating cash flow growth of 10% to 11% and free cash flow growth of 9% to 10% remains unchanged.\nNow turning to Q2 guidance, revenue is expected to be $10.1 to 10.2 billion, up 8% to 9 YoY in nominal and 7% to 8 in constant currency. cRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be 10% YoY in nominal, including a $300 million FX tailwind resulting in 9% constant currency growth. As a reminder, while we have seen more normalized bookings growth recently, cRPO will continue to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the measured sales performance that started in Q2 fiscal year 2023 and our slower expiration base.\nIn closing, we're starting FY 2026 strong with a trusted, deeply unified platform, the most technical leadership team in our history, and a solid foundation to accelerate efficiency and growth. We truly have a once in a lifetime opportunity to lead our customers in this digital labor revolution with Data Cloud, Agentforce, and our Customer 360 apps, all deeply unified within our metadata platform.\nLastly, a huge thank you to our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders for the warm welcome. It's an exciting time to be in this new role at Salesforce. With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Robin. Krista, we'll take the first question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a great start to the fiscal year.\nI guess this is a question for all of you guys, but the excitement around Agentforce and Data Cloud is palpable in how you guys speak about it, and we hear a lot about it when we talk to customers and when we talk to channel partners as well.\nI think what a lot of investors are wondering is the transmission mechanism of when does this become a bigger driver for the overall growth rates at Salesforce? 10% is good, but we'd like to see acceleration against that. We'd like to see you guys getting back to more of like a growth footing. Can you talk to us about some of the puts and takes of that? I'm sure there's some timing issues involved. Robin, you talked about a weak expiry base, but when can we really see the trajectory of Salesforce start to pick up from here?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I really am excited about that question because obviously we want to have growth. We also want to have good, solid, balanced execution as well. This is, I think, a big commitment of the company that we are going to.\nFirst and foremost, we're going to maintain our margin framework, we're going to maintain our cash flow framework. You heard about the very disciplined approach to M&A. Before I go into my pitch on growth, I really want to make sure that everybody heard what I just said, that I'm committed to all of those things, but I'm also deeply committed to growth. Growth is really where we're at right now.\nYou can see why growth is so important because we are in a moment in time where every company is coming to us saying, how do I go forward and how do I deliver this incredible agentic revolution? What that means for us is a number of things that we all have to put into place.\nOne thing is we need to, you know, now that we kind of have our, I would say kind of the margin transformation behind us, the cash flow transformation behind us, the buyback transformation behind us, the dividend transformation behind us, and also I would say we have the acquisition transformation behind us because we saw the acquisition yesterday and also the acquisition last year of Own. Now there's one more huge transformation that is really underway and it's really driven by this agentic AI moment.\nThat is the growth transformation. Our approach to that is going to be really focused, first and foremost, on distribution. Miguel Milano is here as the chief revenue officer who works directly for me. We also have at the table Srini, our chief engineering officer, and Sebastian, our chief legal officer. Of course, Robin and all of us together are deeply committed to continuing the incredible success of the company.\nNow, how would we even accelerate growth at this level? Well, the way we would do it is we've really identified that there's a lot of growth happening already in the company. One of the big areas of growth that's already happening is in small and medium business. Another area that happened in the first quarter is in the mid market.\nWe even saw a lot of signs for incredible growth in a lot of our geographic regions like Japan and others, and in our core technologies like we mentioned with Data Cloud in AI. When we start to put all of these pieces together, that's where we also decided to now hire, you know, another 1,000 to 2,000 more salespeople because there are a lot of parts of our business that need investment to grow.\nWe are doing that as well. I want to get back, we're still going to maintain that margin framework. While we're making these huge investments, while we are scaling distribution again, while we're doing all these things that have been kind of on pause, I would say for the last three years for a lot of good reasons.\nNow we're really saying, okay, we can actually do some things in these key areas that are growing. We can supercharge them.\nMiguel, do you want to just speak to some of the growth initiatives that you have underway and some of the things that you're especially excited about, not only performance in the quarter, but how you see over the next one to two years from a growth opportunity for the company and how we're going to rapidly move from where we are this year at 41 and into these higher revenue levels, hopefully in the 50s and 60s, while maintaining the margin and cash flow disciplines that we have now picked up as a core competency.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nAbsolutely. Marc, Keith, thank you for the question. Good question. Obviously, growth is our obsession.\nI share the very positive sentiment that both Marc and Robin already share in this call. I don't think we've ever been in a better position in this business. I can tell you there are some qualitative comments that we made about ADAM, our framework, our deeply unified platform, that flywheel. It's incredible. It's starting to happen.\nIt's great to be in two markets that are seminal, the data activation market, and also the agentic market. Everything is coming together, and it's reinforcing the power of our applications. By the way, we're bringing these to public sector very soon. I think I'm also excited about some hard facts in go to market that are non disputable. The expanded AE capacity that Marc referred to today, we have 13,000 AEs.\nBy the way, we've not only had the record number of AES in the history of the company, this is 14% growth year-on-year to date. At the end of the quarter, it's going to be 19% growth. At the end of the year, it's going to be 22% growth. We have also been extremely diligent over the last two years to put this capacity in the areas of higher productivity and higher growth.\nWe also have very strong pipeline, open pipeline, and also great pipe gen momentum at velocity, all in the double-digit growth. Also, as Marc referred earlier in his comment, we have an incredibly well-oiled run rate machine.\nI mean, run rate is nearly 60% of our business, and the small and medium business is approaching 50%, and that is humming, is growing in the mid high teens. Of course, we are well known for how we are able to structure and create big deals, and that motion is strengthening.\nPricing and packaging is also helping, Marc, a lot. It's making our customers, we're making it much easier for our customers to simplify the relationship with us, and to own our fully unified platform. Also, increasing ASP per seat. Overall, I couldn't be more excited. I joined the company, as you know, in 2011, and the momentum is incredible. AWS Marketplace, just to mention that, I think is incredible. The partnership with AWS, we transacted $2 billion of business through them, hundreds of transactions, and it's tripling year-on-year right now.\nI've never felt as strong as I feel now in the future of the.Company\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nBecause, you know, I really want to get into this to one more level because, you know, obviously I'm completely in sympathy with this. Number one is obviously you came into the company in 2011. We had asked, we'd been recruiting you for many years. You were at Oracle, you know, running a huge part of their business. Before that, you were at McKinsey as well.\nYou know, then you unfortunately left Salesforce, I think four years ago or five years ago to become the Chief Revenue Officer of another company. We won't go into that. We patiently recruited you back and we got you back. What is it, two years ago now?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nTwo years ago.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nYou've been here for two years. You're now working directly for me as the CRO. Our 15 core distribution unit leaders all are reporting directly to you. You know, what was your biggest surprise in Q1? What was it? When you look back, you obviously had a great quarter. What was it, the Q1 where you went, wow, that was a huge surprise. I should be investing more here, here, and here, because these are, these are growth levers. I really didn't realize we even had.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nI mean, obviously it's a leading question. You know the answer, Marc. I have to say, I was shocked to see the momentum that we were enjoying in the low end of the market, small, medium, and mid market. In fact, we, that made us really rethink the exercise of capacity allocation. We realized that we had allocated enough growth in some of the areas, but not across the 15 OUs.\nEven within Q2, we are reallocating capacity to the low end of the market. The other thing that became very important, and this goes back to Keith's question, is, I mean, it's great to be owning two segments, the Data Cloud segment, the data activation business, and the agentic business that is growing triple digit. What if we could grow even faster? I think the participation across my organization needs to be improved.\nI mean we want, I told my whole organization, 13,008, you need to sell a Data Cloud deal in Q2, you need to sell an Agentforce deal in Q2. I think if we can grow that instead of triple digit, high triple digit, that would accelerate the growth of the company.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWhen you really look at distribution capacity expansion year-over-year, by the time we get to the end of this fiscal year, what's your dream in terms of what our total distribution capability, what is the percentage growth that you'll have seen?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nWe are aiming at 22% overall capacity growth. We're going to be growing more on the low end of the market, the small medium business, and the mid market. That's an incredibly healthy growth. We've never, I mean in the last two years we've been flat most of the time, and now to be able to come into H2 with 14% growth.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThese market segments, it's also distribution capacity expansion. One more question I have for you. What are some of these geographic regions that are just blowing your mind in terms of their, you know, insatiability for our products and capabilities?\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nI mean, as Robin referred to, we again, we are lucky because we run a highly diversified portfolio of businesses across industries, but also across geographies.\nWe saw strong momentum in Canada. The whole South Asia is on fire, the whole Asia Pacific is on fire, and even Europe, there are great pockets of growth. France and UK outdelivered in the quarter, and of course, there are other places where we see more measured performance, but overall, we see demand across every geo.\nI get asked many, many times, okay, do you see a different geo behavior? The truth is, every geography, every account, every segment, every industry, they need two things. They need to activate their data, and they need an agentic layer on top of their applications.\nI think Data Cloud and Agentforce are so powerful that now many companies are wondering why would I deploy any touch point, any customer's touch point on an app that is not a Salesforce app? It doesn't make sense.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator. We'll take the next question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks, Robin. Just on the growth rate, I'm just curious, given some of the macro and tariff uncertainty, have you seen any uncertainty in your customer behavior? Clearly, putting up good double-digit RPO backlog was good to see. What are your thoughts on what you're seeing in your pipeline?\n\nRobin Washington\n\nChief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Brent, I'll reiterate what Miguel said. We do have this overall balanced portfolio, you know, so we were able to think about that relative to our guidance and the puts and takes. Knowing what we know today, it's been helpful to us.\nWe also have the strong momentum, as you've heard us talk about, with data and AI. You know, we have a modest contribution from Agentforce, but we see that to be a continued needle mover. We've factored in the headwinds, but overall, that plus the FX change gives us a lot of confidence in where we stand today. You also heard Miguel talk about the AE capacity that will ramp and be available for the second half. We feel really good.\nWe're excited about our products, we're excited about our capacity, and as you heard us talk about, our options to grow are in line with what we believe is ability to deliver on our guidance.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Krista, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. The main highlight for me if I look through the numbers this quarter was the strength in platform. Marc, you talked about Tableau. Can you talk a little bit about how that combined portfolio of Tableau, MuleSoft, Informatica is kind of going to change the game for you around Agent and the whole company. Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think you're really onto something because, you know, and I'm going to ask Srini to come in here also. You know, I think that number one, if you were at the Tableau conference, you really saw this incredible new Tableau.\nBut one of the things about that's powerful about the Tableau, that has the agentic layer, not only is it integrated now deeply integrated into our Data Cloud, but it's deeply integrated into our metadata platform and it runs on Hyperforce. And I'll tell you that if you're using Slack now, you'll see Tableau is appearing within that. If you're using our core applications, Tableau is now appearing within that. And Tableau is now part and parcel with our core functionality and kind of the core components of every other part of Salesforce. So I'm super excited about that.\nWe also went through a pretty big transformation on distribution with Tableau, where our Tableau sales leaders who were basically what we call prime account executives, that they were kind of independent on the side running as their own kind of, you know, sales organization.\nThey're now deeply integrated into our distribution organization where all of our salespeople are now selling Tableau as a core part of our product line, and those distribution leaders are now supporting them in what we call a kind of a co-prime position. But I'll tell you that this idea that Tableau and the new Tableau are really all of our products built on this ADAM Framework is really being led by Srini as our chief engineering officer. Srini also runs customer support; he also runs professional services.\nSrini also runs South Asia which includes everywhere from Singapore, including Thailand, Malaysia, and all the South Asian countries and all of India as well, including our Indian engineering operations. Asheni, would you like to come in and kind of fill that in?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nPresident, Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer, Salesforce\n\nYes, thank you Marc. So I think I would still frame the bigger point. As you know, Agentforce is everybody wants to do agents. This is a new thing. Every customer talks, starts, and ends with talking about Agentforce. And that's a digital labor platform for the enterprise, and it's built on this deeply unified, enterprise-scale, trusted, open, and metadata platform.\nBut all Agentforce is tied to the data strategy. And if you really think of data strategy, this is what Data Cloud is very important. It unifies and activates data with zero copy. MuleSoft is very important. It connects all your apps and systems to manage those APIs because that's what the agents need. And then Tableau turns all those insights built on this ADAM Framework into action, and that's where the energy is.\nAnd of course Informatica will now accelerate, will help us accelerate and expand our data strategy. So this enterprise grade data platform with MuleSoft, Data Cloud, Tableau, and in the future with Informatica gives enterprises a really trusted data platform which is what is required to really make the promise of agent true.\nBecause that's what people want, a trusted agent which is scaling, which they can trust, which is really delivers the value and the work we have been doing for the last three and a half, four years right from the database layer, right from Hyperforce, then we got all the data layer rewriting everything in the ADAM Framework is what people are now seeing it.\nAs Marc referred, when we did the test Tableau conference, the Datafam was really thrilled because now they see not just themselves as just visualizing and providing insights, but also as agent blazers. They see this future where they can be part of building agents and bring it all together. So that's how this is all coming together.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat, thanks Raimo. Krista, we'll take the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh great. Thank you so much. We certainly are hearing the same success that you're describing in the Agentforce cycle amongst channel partners. Marc, I wanted to ask you a question around some of the indicators that you're paying attention to that give you the comfort that this cycle is going to be material for the company.\nIs it simply these Data Cloud deals that you're seeing momentum there as customers load the data there? Some of these pilot deals you referred to, what are some of the leading indicators that you're looking to that suggests that this is a, this is a big cycle coming. Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Well, it's a great question and I think we have to just kind of get right back to the beginning, which is you can kind of look at these earnings calls and like a year ago we weren't really even.\nI don't think the word agent was even on our earnings call a year ago. Maybe it wasn't even on our earnings call nine months ago. But it started to appear. And you know, when we released the product end of October, it's November, December, January, February, March, April. Here we are in May.\nSo just think about in a relatively short period of time. I've never seen in my career over 45 years in enterprise software this idea that we now have 8,000 customers, 4,000 of whom are paying, many of them who have done scaled deployments where this is working in months. It just makes no sense actually to me.\nYou know, obviously, you know, most of these products and these technologies like Data Cloud or look at any of our core apps or Hyperforce or all the things that Srini has built, you know, that Miguel has sold, you know, what the company has put together. These things take years, not months, not days, not weeks.\nSo we're moving very, very fast. I think one of the most important things, and I think Miguel can really speak to this, and I'll have him do that at the end of this, is that when we sell an Agentforce, we're not just dropping some box off and saying, okay, we sold an Agentforce, we're pulling, you know, all of our clouds in. And I'm sure that you, you know, heard like for example in the example I think of PepsiCo, they have 11 of our clouds.\nSo you know, when we're pulling in Agentforce, where all the other products are coming along with it. Obviously Agentforce and Data Cloud are absolutely deeply unified and connected. But Agentforce and Data Cloud are deeply integrated and connected to every single one of our products.\nThis is a huge transformation that we have created just in the last two years. So two years ago when we went through our huge financial transformation, we also decided maybe aggressively to also go through a huge innovation transformation. And we have rewritten all of our apps, all of our Data Cloud, and created an agentic layer and Hyperforce and brought it all together as one unified platform. And two years ago it was just not there.\nIt's one of the reasons why we feel very comfortable right now acquiring Informatica because we can see how it can radically extend what we have done, complement it. It's incredibly additive. This ability to harmonize all of this data. It just is going to make everything better for our customers and give this platform that we have a lot more capability.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nThis part, I comment on the non-standalone nature of Agentforce as a reference. We took all the deals, all the Agentforce deals for the quarter, on average. There were four other clouds on those deals also, as Robin referred earlier: 1/3 of our top 100 deals, including both Agentforce and Data Cloud.\nBut I look at the top six, the top six which on average $34 million of TCV on average on each of them. On those six, 5 of them have Data Cloud as an anchor and also Agentforce as an anchor. The one customer that didn't buy on the top six Data Cloud is because they bought in Q4 a multimillion-dollar deal on Data Cloud. They set the data foundation before they went to adding more clouds and Agentforces on the top six on Agentforce.\nOn the top six deals, five bought Agentforce. The one that didn't buy is the one that surely you know very well. They, we are negotiating now the extension to Agentforce. So it's kind of magic. But going back to Brad's also question he was referring, okay, what are you really focused on? The reality is, Brad, we're not focused that much on how many more Agentforce deals or Data Cloud. That motion is on fire.\nWe had three times more Data Cloud deals in Q1 than we had the year before. We have also, I mean, infinite numbers more of Agentforce. Because we didn't have Agentforce last year. What we have focused on very much is on consumption. This is a new game by the way.\nThis consumption motion is bringing the company really tight together from finance to product with Steve Fisher with engineering and Dave Meyer with engineering with Srini with the whole company, and go-to-market is really aligned together behind consumption. I mean, my role has changed totally. When I sell, my job starts, and we have huge consumption.\nWe have 22 trillion records ingested, 8 of them 8 trillion through zero copy, which is a fantastic innovation. And as Robin referred earlier on Agentforce, already 30 customers came back and refill the tank. Very exciting. But now that we're touching on the consumption topic, Srini, you've helped me a lot. You come up with this initiative of forward deployed engineers. Can you elaborate a bit more on that?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nPresident, Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah. So I think in my new role as including customer success and professional services as Marc mentioned, I think I'm really obsessed with customer success. Two things, correct. When a new product comes in which is transforming so much, the iteration, the feedback loop between product engineering, customer success, go to market has to be very tight.\nSo the way we have done is we have created, thanks to our Customer Zero initiative on support where Agentforce is handling a lot of things. We use some of, first of all, we use some of those resources to create this forward deployment engineering team. And we're working with a lot of customers hand in hand every day. We're making changes every day to really get the consumption loop going and really get the product maturity. And I see three types of customers.\nWe have customers who are in the expansion phase. They got the first customer. These are 30% additional ACV that Miguel talked about. What are they asking? They're saying they got the first customer live, and they are the people who said hey I really like your conversation but now I really want to expand. I need a better pricing strategy. This is what we listened and created this new action based pricing strategy.\nThey also have day two concerns. They are saying hey now I want to expand it more. I want observability, I wanted the improvement loop. So a lot of our product features we are adding with that. Then we have customers in just in a pilot. They got a first pilot. They are now figuring out how do I get.\nImprove my data estates. Data is becoming very critical, actually, that is what also was driving some of our strategy. Almost every customer I talked to, there is Informatica there. This is also tied to that. Why we are talking about data is very important. They are asking things like setup and determination. They want tools. So we created a testing center. How do you iterate? Because these are all not predictive systems.\nThese are stochastic systems. It's not like regular. So the models are changing, so they need trust and then everybody. This is the broader level, which is enterprise. They want latency. What happens if one of these model providers go down? How do I do local residency? How do I provide auditability?\nI think we are taking all of these features, and we created this forward deployment teams, deployed engineers we call, where we in a tight loop not just with Salesforce but also with a lot of our partners like Accenture, Deloitte, and all, and Neuroflash, and customers like that, and really improving it. I think we are very early stages.\nWe are super excited. We are obsessed about customer success, and the name of the game is to mature the product, really focus on customer success, and iterate the maturity. I think we're learning a lot of things, and that's what we're doing almost. We're releasing product features almost every day.\n\nMiguel Milano\n\nPresident and CRO, Salesforce\n\nThis is a learning journey and we. We're learning at the biggest scale of any vendor right now, across every industry, across every geography, across every segment. This tight feedback loop is very important. Thank you, Srini.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad.\nKrista, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. And I echo my congrats, Marc. With AI and Agentforce advancing quicker than anything we've ever seen, I have to imagine the use cases you're seeing today versus even 90 days ago are blowing you away. What can you tell us about what lies on the leading edge in terms of applications, impact, and ROI of Agentforce and how Data Cloud fits into that? Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I really just have to look directly to these, you know, these stories, you know, with these customers, and you know, as I, as I travel the world, and I'll tell you that, you know, again we've talked about the speed of which Agentforce has gone, but it's not just a US phenomenon, it's an international phenomenon.\nAnd as I mentioned last week, I was in Japan, and one of our customers in Japan, Fujitsu, is really doing some amazing things. But when I heard at the rate and scale and speed that they want to deploy the product and their vision in terms of how it can be all encompassing for an agentic layer around the entire company, I really just could not believe it.\nI really sat with five of the largest Japanese companies, and I think somehow, you know, every company's imagination has been captured that they have this idea that they can build an agentic layer around their company. So of course we've been very focused, you know, for many years, you know, on the customer opportunity, what we've been calling Customer 360. We've deployed that so well in recent years. We've also been incredibly excited about, you know, what's happened with Slack and how we've gone across the enterprise, and then in addition to that, we built this massive data business.\nSo now that's really three different businesses that we're in. You know, we're in our customer business, we're in the Slack business, which is the enterprise-wide business, and we're in this incredible data business. Now, of course, we're also doing that by vertical.\nAll right, well, when we look at that, then when we combine that with this agentic and AI and data capability, that's where I really think that, you know, that it starts to come together in this really powerful and very meaningful way. And that is, you know, what I see over and over and over again.\nAnd I think another really good example is kind of really, we kind of already got into it once before, but I'll just mention it. I was very surprised when I was seeing this demonstration of Smartsheet. And all of a sudden, when we're using the product, and it's obviously, for those of you, you know, it's like a cloud version of Excel, very popular. I think it's got like 13 million users. A lot of you use it, a lot of you have the technology cover the company.\nBut all of a sudden, right inside Smartsheet itself, Agentforce is already now in place and the customer is able to not only get support, but also to add additional users or change, you know, key provisions with their licenses. This idea that agents are kind of starting to provision to become digital labor. This is exceeding my expectation that it crosses industries. It's crossing geographies.\nAs I said, all of this is really just happening in only six months. By the time we get to Dreamforce, which is still another six months ahead, I expect another huge, massive transformation. You know, we're starting to cut the code right now on what will be one of the main releases of Dreamforce.\nAnd when we look at what will come as the release after Dreamforce, our technology, our product doesn't look at all like what it looked like, you know, just a few months ago. So we're moving very, very fast. And I think that I really would say this hasn't really happened too many times in the last 30, 40 years.\nThe rate of innovation far exceeds the rate of customer adoption. The amount of technology and value that we're able to deliver to a customer is just phenomenal, which is why I have a real fever about expanding our distribution organization, especially in these markets, geographies, and segments that are just growing at incredible rates, but for a lot of reasons that have to do with our financial transformation in the last 24 to 36 months. We have not grown those distribution in the segments that were growing.\nIt wasn't a mistake that we were making. It was very mindful. We knew that we were slowing down growth, but we were accelerating margin and cash flow. Now, our challenge is very simple. We're going to grow our margin, we're going to grow our cash flow, but we are going to grow our revenue. And the way that we're going to do it is exactly what Miguel, Srini, and Robin said.\nWe're going to invest at scale into the markets that are growing very dramatically. And we know where they are. We're there. We're seeing the deal whether it's by geography or whether it's by market segment, that is, whether it's by key markets that have grown incredibly since the pandemic, like Japan, Latin America, or even, you know, markets, you know, in the United States, like the tech industry.\nOkay, but where we have not invested distribution capability, we will invest aggressively. Well, we already have. And then we will also, you know, build and create incredible new products and value for those segments as well. And we will also acquire like we did last year with Own. That's been, by the way, an incredible success story.\nSo I think we have a good handle on one how to deliver the numbers that all of our investors want and to deliver this incredible growth by focusing on geography, segments, and product and technology capabilities where the markets are really expanding.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad, Krista, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much, Marc, and team. Great start to the fiscal year. I'll keep my question relatively brief since we're towards the end of the call. Marc, one for you. Obviously, Agentforce is off to a smashing success. You're at 4,000 paid customers. When you look at consumer adoption of generative AI, you've got ChatGPT at 500 million users. The adoption there seems to be off the charts. So what is holding the enterprise back?\nWhat in your view, as somebody that led the cloud cycle, what in your view are two or three maybe unblocks that you could bring to bear? So you could have a 100,000 Agentforce customers versus the 4,000 we have today. One for Robin. Congratulations on taking over the new position. I just want to clarify the time duration when you expect Informatica to be accretive. Is that so?\nYou close the deal early calendar 2026 and it is going to be accretive to calendar 2027. If that's the case, why that long? And why not sooner? How could it be sooner? Thank you so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, well, Kash, I'm so glad you answered the question or asked the question, because I'll tell you that, you know, we've talked about this before, we've answered this question before, but I want to come back and hit it one more time and then really kind of come in and really explain what it is our strategy is and also the huge progress that we've made. But you're. And then the incredible opportunity ahead for everybody.\nNumber one, when we all are using ChatGPT or Gemini, you know, or You.com or Perplexity or Anthropic or any of these models, or an open source model or DeepSeek, okay. You know, all of these models are mostly the same. They're within three to six months of innovation of each other. We all know that.\nAnd then all these models are trained on mostly the same data sets because there's only so much data that they can be trained on. Now there's some synthetic data, but it doesn't mean very much to a lot of these models. That's why, by the way, that these models still have not improved a lot of their accuracy in the consumer side. And you can see those numbers; those benchmarks are very clear.\nSo what happens is you have these advances in these algorithms, you know, models are just algorithms. And then you have these amalgamated data sets which are kind of manufactured off of the Internet data. And then all of a sudden you get this kind of working model and it's kind of like super search. You know, we all have this experience. It's like prompt engineering.\nYou know, we write the prompt and we get the answer. We used to search on Google, and now we're searching, you know, through one of these models. It could be a model that Google has, Gemini, or it could be another model, like you mentioned ChatGPT, or it could be another model, Anthropic, et cetera, or DeepSeek. You're searching, you get the results.\nWhy is that not, boom, an accelerate automatic accelerator for everything you could do in the enterprise? Of course, we could all talk to Microsoft about that, who came in and said that it would be two years ago or three years ago now with Copilot and how that was going to supercharge everything. It turned out that that was a false prophecy because that's not how the enterprise works.\nThe enterprise has data sets that are highly controlled, highly governed, and highly secured. These data sets are everything from your customer data set to your financial data set to your HR data set. The reality is that not all enterprise data is available to all users. Like for example, you work cash at Goldman Sachs. You can't see all the Goldman Sachs customer information.\nThere's regulations around that. You can't see all the employees' salary information. You don't have access to all the Goldman Sachs financial data. When you're using these models, they're not just giving you access to all of this stuff, are they, Kash? No, they have to be tightly controlled.\nBut if I'm a Goldman Sachs customer and I want to come in and I want to ask about my account balance or information about, you know, my, my who I am and what my portfolio looks like or what my opportunities are, or even if I'm a Goldman Sachs employee and I want information on the general information on benefits or how to enable myself or how to sell products more efficiently to customers, all of those things could easily happen right now with the Agentforce platform.\nHowever, there's a lot of things that could not happen as I kind of just amplified, and that is kind of the constraint. So what is it going to take to get this transformation to happen where we have a much bigger agentic wrapper around Goldman Sachs, your company, or around all companies?\nWell, look at my company to start. I think we've probably done the best of maybe any tech company. We've done now this quarter we'll pass through a million conversations and customer support. It's a dramatic reduction in the amount of human beings who have had to get involved to answer customers' issues.\nI don't think any other tech company at scale has delivered this capability. It is a proof point without any doubt that Salesforce has been able to deliver on its vision of digital labor. And Agentforce is number one, Customer Zero Salesforce. So we eat our own dog food, and this is amazing by the way. Compare that to other big tech companies like Microsoft and others who have tried to do that, but they don't have this kind of same velocity and capability.\nThey haven't had this kind of ability because they don't have this approach. Now part of it is we're lucky because we are built on our Customer 360, we're built on our Service Cloud, we're built on our Sales Cloud, we're built on our Marketing Cloud.\nWhen we look at those things, then we can say at a high level, hey Marketing Cloud, wow, you're doing a trillion emails. How do you take those, are one way conversations, how do you make those two way conversations? That's the agentic opportunity. Today for our customers, they all want to get there. They all have the hunger to do that. They all want to have this great success, but it takes some time for them to start to build their data sets.\nThat is why the Informatica acquisition is so important because they all need to not only translate their data to build their master data management, they need to harmonize their data, they need to do all these things. We see that we go into these customers and like, they're like, we can do some but we can't do all.\nThe reason they can't do all is because their whole enterprise data set is not fully harmonized, which is why Informatica is so critical now more than ever. Look, Informatica is a small company. They don't have the distribution scale that we have. They have like a, I'm not going to tell you what the size of their distribution organization is because it's probably covered under my NDA, but it isn't, it's orders of magnitude less than Salesforce, I'll tell you that.\nThat idea that we have the ability to really go out there and start to sell that product to all companies worldwide, to really show them that they need this for this capability now, this is why I have this fever about growing, like Miguel said, our distribution organization by more than 20% this year because, you know, we've held back for the last 36 months, you know, on our, you know, and we've never done that in our history.\nWe did it because of the financial transformation that we wanted to go through. We've done that. It just now is coinciding perfectly with this technology transformation that we're going through, which indeed is a data transformation. That is what's going on.\nWhen we ask a question like you said, well, ChatGPT, Gemini, well, you know, Anthropic, well, you know, DeepSeek, well, you know, Perplexity, well, you know, You.com, there, da da da da da. These are packaged, highly controlled consumer experiences. This is not, you know, what you have, and you understand the enterprise experience very well, Kash, because you are top enterprise analyst. At Goldman Sachs, that's not how it's going to roll.\nWhen we work with Goldman Sachs or we work with another bank, like we've already told a few, we've already deployed at a lot of banks that this idea that we can do this, but it does require, you know, very, you know, significant and critical governance, security, reliability, availability, capability of an enterprise company like Salesforce.\nThe proof point is here, me, help.salesforce.com, and we are going to do that for all companies, but we're going to do it through Slack, we're going to do it through Tableau, we're going to do it in Help, we're going to do it in every product we have, and we're going to do it through an agentic layer, through a data layer, through an app layer, and through a metadata layer. We're going to bring these four things together and dramatically transform every company we do business with, whether they're small, medium, large, or extra large, just like Miguel went through.\n\nRobin Washington\n\nChief Operating and Finance Officer, Salesforce\n\nYeah. Kash. To your other question, timing of close of Informatica as well as time to accretion, you know, subject to regulatory approval. We expect that it's going to close beginning of our fiscal year 2027, which is February of next year, so 26 February.\nThe framework that we've talked about, when we look at deals, we assume can we get it accretive within two years, right. That's kind of our goal. Our desire is always to under promise and over deliver. I think with our playbook that we have in place, we're going to go as fast as possible. We're really focused on accelerating integration, you know, we'll see how that works out. Overall, that framework is the two-year period that I provided to accretion.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kash Krista.\nWe'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\nMarc.\nThe CEO of Anthropic recently commented that AI could wipe out 50% of entry-level white collar jobs and drive unemployment a lot higher, unfortunately. Since you've been very astute and very ahead of the curve on commoditization of LLMs, and you've been very outspoken.\nOn the topic of digital labor, you know, I'm curious just to get your thoughts on that concept and how do you think Salesforce can help companies navigate whatever change is coming our way while maintaining a human touch or human oversight that might be required?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think it's a great question, and I think we all believe in the division of digital labor, and I think I've laid out the case with help.salesforce.com and giving you the metrics. Those employees, though, are really getting, you know, I would say, you know, repositioned in our company in other areas.\nYou know, that is, we really have, we have so much opportunity. I can't hire as many people as I want right now. I'm hiring, I'm very excited. I'm trying to grow distribution, as I mentioned. I'm deploying, I have four deployed engineers I'm trying to hire, I have account executives I'm trying to hire, I am doing, I have a lot of opportunity throughout the world. That is, you know, held back by, wow, there isn't a lot of people to hire. It's actually surprising.\nThat is kind of the interesting.\nYou know, we've all read this paper, for example, AI 2027, which is two years away. When I talk to a lot of my friends, they're like, oh, well, this is my vision exactly of what's going to happen. I'm like, the self replicating rocket ships are not quite here yet. I don't know if you've read this book, We Are Legion. We Are Bob. It's kind of a phenomenon here in Silicon Valley that all these CEOs are reading this one book saying, yes, this is exactly what's going to happen, which kind of yielded Sam Altman's tweet last week. We're not exactly at that point where.\nThe computer is completely conscious, you know, has human consciousness to the point where it's running its own manufacturing facilities, creating its own rocket ships, and launching itself onto the planet. To that point, we aren't exactly even to that point yet where all these white collar jobs are just suddenly disappearing.\nI think that we realize while AI can do some things, while this is very exciting in the enterprise, we all know it cannot do everything, and it doesn't have the accuracy yet because it's built on a word model. Word models are inherently not 100% accurate because of the way that the computer science works, where it's, as you all know, this word, that word, this word, and then therefore it's this other word, and there's this kind of matrix between this word and all the other words.\nWhen you look at it, the mathematics don't work out to be 100% accurate. It's in the math is the hallucinations, which is why people say, oh, the hallucinations are a feature, because it's not going away with that model. We are going to have to have other models that are going to have to come in the future, world models or multi sensory models or other things. AI is a continuum, and we're not totally there yet.\nIn terms of the amount of white collar jobs that are going to disappear, you're all experts at this point in the current generation of AI, you're using it every day. We're all using it. It doesn't matter who I speak to. Probably all of your children, all of your family members are using it, and you can see how it's impacted. Like, people are smarter.\nThey get their medical labs, they ask, well, what do you think about this? When you call your doctor, sometimes the doctor goes, well, actually, that's not completely true. We're kind of at this point where it's very good on some things, but not for everything.\nBecause of that, even in the enterprise, while there's a lot of things that we can do, edit this press release or write me this speech or whatever, the reality is you're probably still going to want to get in there and work on it. I think we all know that. Look, we're at an exciting moment in AI, and maybe we're moving into this world where there's going to be, you know, like, these AI profits. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of Dario's, who's great, you know, amazing person, incredible company, wonderful.\nSome of these comments I think are alarmist and get a little aggressive in the current form of AI today. Not that it's not a great company. By the way, Salesforce is a huge investor in Anthropic. Love the company, love Dario. We have embedded it into Slack. It's how Slack does its recap, and a lot of its little magical things that happen, like talking to you in your channels, but it's not at that point.\nThat's kind of why I've said Copilot is kind of the new Clippy in a lot of ways, because, yeah, you can do some things, but it's kind of got overhyped, and we need to show you what you really can do, how you really can transform your enterprise, how the magic is really can happen.\nBy the way, if you haven't used Tableau Next, this is the best example where you're using Tableau. We all know Tableau. We've loved it. We've used it for 20 years. Now there's an agent there with you, and it's on Data Cloud, and it's integrated with Slack and all these other things. Amazing. That amazing part is what we're going to do more of, and, you know, we're not ready to, like, I think, take the action that Dario suggested. I hope that that answered your question.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Mark. Thanks for the question, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on our Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website.\nJoining me on the call today is.\nMarc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which could change should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect. Actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks and uncertainties, and assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings.\nExcept as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right, well, hey, thanks so much, Mike, and I just really appreciate everybody being on the call today. We have so many exciting, exciting things to talk about, and I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. We're incredibly excited about these results that we've delivered in the quarter and very strong performance across revenue, operating margin, CRPO, and cash flow. But as I'm sure everybody knows on the quarter, these numbers are not what we're really excited about at Salesforce. And while the quarter numbers are fantastic, the real excitement is really what is hitting with the technology. And I'm really excited to talk to you about that.\nBut before we do, let's talk about that incredible financial transformation that we've undergone over the last few years. You're going to hear more from Brian and Amy about what we're doing to redefine success, delivering this kind of financial value for our customers, but achieving these incredible results. So this is about so much more than another great quarter. We're really at the edge of a revolutionary transformation. This is really the rise of digital labor. Now, you know, I would say for the last 25 years, you know, at Salesforce, and.\nYou know, we've been helping companies to manage and share their information. And you can see that across our whole product line. And whether it's in sales or service or marketing or commerce, whether it's analytics, Slack across the board.\nBut now we've really created a whole new market, a new TAM, a TAM that is so much bigger and so much more exciting than the data management market. It's hard to get our head completely around. This is the market for digital labor. And Salesforce has become right out of the gate here, the largest supplier of digital labor. And this is just the beginning. And it's all powered by these autonomous AI agents. All of you know that this is fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate. It's fundamentally reshaping how we operate our business and how we think about the industry itself, how you're thinking about the industry, and how we're thinking about Salesforce. And with Salesforce AgentForce, we're not just imagining this future; we're already delivering it. And you should know that in the last week of the quarter, AgentForce went production. We delivered 200 deals.\nOur pipeline is incredible for future transactions. We can talk about that with you on the call, but we've never seen anything like it. We don't know how to characterize it. This is really a moment where productivity is no longer tied to workforce growth, but to this intelligent technology that can be scaled without limits. AgentForce represents this next evolution of Salesforce. This is a platform. Now, Salesforce is a platform where AI agents work alongside humans in a digital workforce that amplifies and augments human capabilities and delivers with unrivaled speed. You can see that I'm going to get into it. You know, you go to help.salesforce.com; you can see we've unleashed that on our entire support organization already. We've created this incredible agentic layer around the whole company. This is just the beginning of a complete digital transformation for the world.\nYou know, on top of this agentic layer, we'll soon see a robotic layer as well, where these agents will manifest into robots. How all this is going to change society is, you know, only visible today in the movies or in our imaginations. But we can see it unfolding right here through this company, Salesforce. And that is what we are really excited about. These agents are not tools. They are becoming collaborators. They're working 24/7 to analyze data, make decisions, take action. And we can all start to picture this enterprise managing millions of customer interactions daily with AgentForce, seamlessly resolving issues, processing transactions, anticipating customer needs, freeing up humans to focus on the strategic initiatives, and building meaningful relationships.\nAnd this is going to evolve into customers that we have, whether it could be a large hospital or a large hotel, where not only are the agents working, you know, 24/7, but robots are also working side by side with humans. Robots manifest manifestations of agents. This idea that it's all happening before our eyes and that this isn't just some far-off future, it's happening right now. And with AgentForce, we're unleashing this new area of era of digital labor for every business and every industry. And the implications are just simply profound. For decades, economic growth depended on expanding the human workforce. You know, it was all about getting more labor. But with labor and with the labor force stagnating globally, AgentForce is unlocking a new path forward. It's a new level of growth for the world and for our GDP.\nBusinesses no longer need to choose between scale and efficiency with agents. They can achieve both. Our customers are already experiencing this transformation. Agentforce is deflecting service cases and resolving issues, processing qualifying leads, helping close more deals, creating optimizing marketing campaigns, all at an unprecedented scale 24/7. You know, we all saw this unfolding at Dreamforce in San Francisco. You were all there. I really appreciate you all coming and being with us. But I think what you saw and what was remarkable was the huge thirst that our customers had for this and how they built more than 10,000 agents in three days. And I think, you know, that we then unleashed a world tour of that program.\nWe have now built thousands and thousands of more agents in these world tours all over the world, giving our customers the ability to understand and get their hands on the technology and envision for their own companies what they're going to do. Now we're seeing this demand for AgentForce, like, as I've said, you know, just became available on 24 October 2024 and we're already seeing this incredible velocity. More than 200 AgentForce deals just in Q3. It doesn't mean anything because the pipeline is in the thousands for potential transactions that are coming up in future quarters. Companies like FedEx, Deco, Accenture, Ace Hardware, IBM, RBC Wealth Management, and many more are now building their digital labor forces on the Salesforce platform with AgentForce.\nSo that is the largest and most important companies in the world across all geographies, across all industries are now building and delivering agents. And Salesforce is unique as we are perhaps one of the only companies at scale in enterprise that is now delivering this globally. We could not be more excited; we could not be more proud of our teams, our technology teams, our engineering teams, our product teams, our marketing teams, and our distribution teams for getting this to market first. And look, we are not only prepared for this agent based agent first future; we're leading it for our customers and ourselves. And as you know, we pride ourselves on being customer zero for all of our products, and Agentforce is no exception. We're excited to share that.\nAgentForce is now live on help.salesforce.com. I hope that you've all gone there and checked it out. You might have also noticed that we have a test going on for our US customers where we put an agent at the front of our website as well to kind of see what that is. It's an ungrounded agent, but it's really a vision for what the potential of what agents can be doing at every part of marketing. Our help portal, help.salesforce.com, which is now live. This portal, you know, is our primary support mechanism for our customers. It lets them authenticate in, it then becomes grounded with the agent. That help portal already is handling 60 million sessions and more than 2 million support cases every year now. That is 100% on AgentForce.\nIt's going to have dramatic implications for our company from not only the technology point of view, but also from a human resource point of view where we can really start to look at how are we going to rebalance our headcount into areas that now are fully automated and into areas that are critical for us to grow like distribution. I think you've all heard that we're trying to hire 1,000, 2,000 more salespeople because we see not only maximized our productivity of our current sales force over the last couple years, but we just need to grow and expand to reflect this incredible distribution opportunity. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to really help customers achieve something they could never have done before.\nWhile these legacy chatbots have handled these basic tasks like password resets and, you know, other basic mundane things, AgentForce is really unlocking an entirely new level of digital intelligence and operational efficiency at this incredible scale. Now, when you use help.salesforce.com especially as an authenticated user, as I mentioned, you're going to see this incredible level of accuracy and responsiveness, and you're going to see remarkably low hallucinogenic performance, whether for solving simple queries or navigating complex service issues. Because AgentForce is not just grounded in our Salesforce data and metadata, including the repository of 740,000 documents in 17 languages. It's also grounded in each customer's data: their purchases, returns, that data.\nIt's that 200 PB or 2 to 100 to 300 PB of Salesforce data that we have that gives us this kind of, I would say, almost unfair advantage with AgentForce because our agents are going to be more accurate and the least hallucinogenic of any because they have access to this incredible capability. An AgentForce can instantly reason over this vast amounts of data, deliver precise personalized answers with citations in seconds. AgentForce can seamlessly hand off to support engineers delivering them complete summary and recommendation as well. You can all try this today. This isn't some fantasy land future idea, you know, this is today reality. I just want to compare and contrast that against other companies who say they are doing enterprise AI. You can look at even Microsoft. We all know about Copilot.\nYou know, it's been out; it's been touted now for a couple of years. We've heard about Copilot; we've seen the demos. In many ways, it's just repackaged ChatGPT. You can really see the difference where Salesforce now can operate its company on our platform. I don't think you're going to find that on Microsoft's website, are you? I know many of you are specialists in Microsoft. Go ahead and try to find this running on Microsoft.com, and I will. Looking forward to getting your responses. Look, we expect that our own transformation with Agentforce on help.salesforce.com and in many other areas of our company is going to deflect between 1/4 and 1/2 of our annual case volume, and in optimistic cases, probably much, much more of that. Agentforce is going to deliver the same unprecedented accuracy, speed, and cost savings to our customers.\nNow when we look at customers that are starting to implement this today. There's a lot of great examples. One of them is the smart home security provider Vivint. They've struggled with this high volume of support calls, a high churn rate for service reps. It's a common story. But now using Agentforce, Vivint is creating a digital support staff to autonomously provide support through their app, their website, troubleshooting a broad variety of issues across all their customer touch points. And in addition, Vivint is planning to utilize AgentForce to further automate technician scheduling, payment requests, proactive issue resolution, the use of device telemetry, because AgentForce is across the entire Salesforce product line and including Slack. So now here's another great customer example that's already, you know, incredible the work they've already done to get this running and going in their company.\nAdecco, world's leading provider of talent solutions, handling 300 million job applications annually. But historically, they have just not been able to go through or respond in a timely way, of course, to the vast majority of applications that they're gaining. But now Agentforce can operate incredible scale, sorting through the millions of resumes 24/7, matching candidates to opportunities, proactively pre-qualifying them for recruiters. And in addition, Agentforce can also assist candidates, helping them to refine their resumes and giving them a better chance of qualifying for a role. Now listen, we've been talking on these earnings calls for, I don't know, more than a year, maybe two years. Why Salesforce has an unfair advantage in AI. I think we took one earnings call just to talk about the power of data and what the power of data meant for Salesforce.\nNow you're really seeing that get manifested right into the customer themselves and getting that value. We don't just pull a software delivering the philosophy anymore. We're really showing you that yes, Salesforce is already the largest supplier of enterprise AI in the world. 2 Trillion Einstein transactions a week. No one is delivering this level of enterprise AI that we are. But now we're not just delivering that Einstein transaction. We're delivering these incredible AgentForce capabilities as well. This is a bold leap into the future of work where AI agents with humans unite to transform all of our customer interactions. Another powerful example is a nonprofit College Possible. You know, College Possible matches eligible students with counselors to help them navigate and become, you know, you know, ready for college.\nIn California, for example, the statewide average stands at slightly over one counselor for every 500 students. It just isn't enough. Where are we going to get all that labor? Well, we know where we're going to get that labor. We're going to get it from Agentforce. This means the vast majority of students are not getting the help they need, and now they are going to get the help they need. College Possible creates a virtual counselor built on Agentforce. In under a week, they already had all the data, they had the metadata. They already knew the students. They already had all the capabilities, you know, built into their whole Salesforce application. It was just a flip of a switch. I mean, you have to think about that for just a second.\nWe have 135,000 customers, and those 135,000 customers have now been endowed with AgentForce. It's in every single one of those implementations today. It's just a switch that needs to get flipped on. Our job is to motivate, to excite, to, to inspire our customers to turn that switch on right now. When you look at College Possible, yes, it's very exciting. Any high school student will have access to this college counselor that knows about their goals, their transcripts, all the information on the colleges that can deliver this highly personalized experience for them. But why? It's because all of the work and the data and the capability that College Possible has put into Salesforce over the years and years that they had it. It's not the week that it took to get them to turn it on. They have done a lot of work.\nWhen you look at those 135,000 customers that we have, they have so much work in the Salesforce to organize and get all that data and workflow ready, and now they can just turn those agents on. Now we're working with, you know, across all kinds of industries to do so many different and exciting areas. We could go on and on and on. Now, over the last few years, we've really aggressively invested in integrating all of our apps on a single core platform with shared services for security, workflow, user interface, and more. We've been rewriting all of our acquisitions into that common area. We're really looking at how do we take all of our applications and all of our acquisitions, everything, and deliver it into one consistent platform. We call that More Core internally inside Salesforce.\nWhen you look at that more core initiative, I don't think there's anyone who delivers this comprehensive platform, sales, service, marketing, commerce, analytics, Slack, all of it as one piece of code. Then now deeply integrated in that one piece of code is also our Data Cloud. You know, that is a key part of our strategy, which continues to have this phenomenal momentum as well to help customers unify and federate with zero copy data access across all their data and metadata, which is crucial for AI to work. Now that third layer is really opening up for us, which is this agentic layer. We have built this agentic layer that takes advantage of all the investments in Salesforce for our customers and made it in our platform.\nIt's really these three layers, and in these three layers, that form a complete AI system for enterprises and really uniquely differentiate Salesforce, uniquely differentiate Agentforce, you know, from every other AI platform. You know that this is one piece of code. This isn't like three systems. It's not a bunch of different apps all running independently. This is all one piece of code. That's why it works so well, by the way, because it is one platform. And we understand that this extraordinary technology is also to require us to have some kind of extraordinary responsibility. At Salesforce, trust is our number one value. It's never been more critical, especially with this pioneering new technology. We're committed to building Agentforce with accountability, fairness, and transparency at the core.\nWe've been focusing on empowering our customers and partners to also navigate this era, equipping them with the tools, skills, and education to thrive in an AI-driven economy. You know that because you've heard so many.\nPresentations and thoughts on this that we've put together with our team.\nBecause we obviously, this is just our latest.\nMoment in AI. So the transformation is not without challenges. Jobs are going to evolve, roles are going to shift, and businesses will need to adapt. And listen, at Salesforce, jobs are going to evolve, and roles will shift, and businesses will need to adapt as well. We're all going to need to rebalance our workforces as agents take on more of the workforce, and then we can rebalance and reshape our companies into new ways. You know, history has shown us that with every disruption comes an explosion of new opportunities. This morning I was on the phone with one of our large customers, and they were telling me how they're targeting inside their company 25% more efficiency with artificial intelligence. Incredible goal. You know, this is an incredible moment.\nEntire industries are going to emerge fueled by innovation and creativity of people using Agentforce to solve challenges, to reach new heights. It's just the beginning of a level of innovation and change that none of us have really ever seen. It's a radical expansion of our total addressable market. And it's really the beginning of a change that we're going to see that's including agents, that's going to include robots, that's going to include the use of the data, and the metadata and all the technology that we've been pioneering now for the last several decades. This is more than a technological revolution. It's an opportunity to create a better future for all of us. And at Salesforce, we believe business is the greatest platform for change. And with Agentforce, we're leading the way into a new horizon of digital labor.\nWe're excited to take this vision for deploying a digital labor force for every organization even further. You're going to now, and this is incredible even to be able to say this because we just introduced AgentForce in October. But I want to invite all of you to join us for the launch of AgentForce 2.0 and It is incredible what you are going to see. The advancements in the technology already are amazing in accuracy, in the ability to deliver even additional value. We hope that you're going to join us in San Francisco. This is going to happen on 17 December. You'll see AgentForce 2.0 for the first time and you're not going to believe it. You're not going to want to miss it. Now over to Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nHey, thanks, Marc. Really appreciate it. I've been at Salesforce almost as long as Marc and Parker and this is the most exciting time in my career at the company. We redefined enterprise software with cloud and social and mobile and predictive AI over the past 25 years and now we're doing it again with AgentForce. As Marc said, this is the beginning of a revolutionary transformation that will fundamentally redefine how we work and how work gets done. Our strong results in the quarter reflect the trust our customers, partners, and stakeholders have in Salesforce to lead them into this new agent-first world. We made great progress in the quarter against Salesforce growth pillars first and foremost with AgentForce and Data Cloud, but also with our multi-cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, and our ecosystem. AgentForce will enable companies to achieve a new era of abundance.\nWith more efficiency, more productivity, even stronger customer relationships, higher margins, and higher revenues across every industry. It's a new technology model and a new business model, and we built a complete Agent first platform for customers that will save them millions of dollars and provide them with limitless workforces to drive greater value. Companies like reMarkable and Wiley are already seeing incredible results. Wiley, an early adopter, is resolving cases with over 40% faster with AgentForce than their previous chatbot. Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, will be able to respond to thousands of travelers' inquiries instantly, accurately, and simultaneously. SharkNinja, a new logo in the quarter, chose AgentForce and Commerce Cloud to deliver 24/7 personalized support for customers across 28 international markets. In unifying its service operations, our customer success with AgentForce and our AI solutions is driving strong results in Q3.\nThe number of wins greater than $1 million with AI more than tripled year-over-year, and we signed more than 2,000 AI deals, including more than the 200 AgentForce wins that Mark shared. To capture this increased demand for AgentForce, we're hiring 1,400 AES globally in our fourth quarter, and we're also using new sales SDR agent and sales Coaching agent to augment Agent every seller. We're also seeing amazing AgentForce energy across the ecosystem with our global partners involved in 75% of our Q3 AgentForce deals and nine of our top 10 wins in the quarter. Over 80,000 system integrators have completed AgentForce training, and hundreds of ISVs and technology partners are building and selling agents. Our partners are also becoming Agent First Enterprises themselves. In the quarter, Accenture chose AgentForce to streamline sales operations and enhanced bid management for its 52,000 global sellers.\nBy integrating Sales Coach and custom AI agents, AgentForce is improving deal quality and targeting a 75% boost in bid coverage. We see an incredible future with AgentForce not only for our customers but also for us. As Customer zero, we can leverage AgentForce ourselves to realize the benefits of digital labor force to amplify and augment our human workforce. Marc talked about how we've reimagined Salesforce customer service with AgentForce or also deploying AgentForce to engage our prospects on Salesforce.com answering their questions 24/7 as well as handing them off to our SDR team. You can see it for yourself and test it out on our homepage. We'll use our new agent for SDR AgentForce SDR Agent to further automate top-of-funnel activities when gathering leads, lead data for providing education and qualifying prospects and booking meetings.\nInitiatives like this and many others mean Salesforce will become a new lever for productivity growth and efficiency for Salesforce, which should save millions of hours and free up hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvest into our strategic growth initiatives. Become an Agent First Enterprise starts with having unified data. That's why we continue to see amazing momentum with Data Cloud, which was included in eight of our top 10 wins in the quarter. Today, 25% of the Fortune 100 are Data Cloud customers. Marc mentioned the Adecco Group. They're centralizing more than 40 instances in legacy systems with Data Cloud to build a foundation to implement AgentForce at scale. Usage is a key indicator for our product's value to our customers, and our customers are now processing 767 trillion records every month.\nIndeed, the world's leading job site, hires three people every second on its platform using Data Cloud as its go-to-market data architecture. Indeed matches 580 million job seeker profiles with over 3 million employers. With AgentForce, Indeed aims to halve time to hire and help 3 million people overcome employment barriers by 2030. IBM, one of our valued strategic partners, selected Data Cloud in the quarter to enhance their global client service. With a unified view of all client interactions and actionable usage insights, they can deliver even more efficient personalized experiences. Proprietary unstructured data is a powerful fuel for AI, and we're excited that we were able to close the acquisition of Zoomin to accelerate and unlock the unstructured data to power AI agents, making them more personalized and context-aware for every customer interaction.\nWe also finalized our acquisition of the Own Company. Own's data management capabilities complement our existing offerings and will strengthen data security, privacy, and compliance across our platform. As Marc described, AgentForce is a game changer for our core products, enabling customers to leverage AI-powered insights and actions directly in the flow of work across our entire product portfolio. This is evidenced by the strong demand for Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, both of which achieved double-digit growth in Q3. We also just wrapped up another incredible Cyber Week during which Commerce Cloud powered close to 50 million orders on digital storefronts with nearly 100% uptime. Salesforce powered nearly 60 billion AI-powered product recommendations, a 21% increase year-over-year, and over 56 billion marketing messages were sent via Marketing Cloud. Service Cloud also helped our customers field and resolve 3.8 billion cases.\nClearly the scale reliability intelligence of our integrated platform is unmatched, and we continue to see solid momentum with Slack. With wins at Capital One, Snap, Rivian, and Volkswagen Group Technology, annual spend on Slack AI grew nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter, and Slack was included in more than 1/3 of our deals greater than a million dollars. Since the release of Slack AI, our customers have summarized over 600 million messages, saving them a collective 1.1 million hours. Tableau and MuleSoft continue to be foundational and fundamental to our customers' transformations, and in the quarter, Tableau had wins at Allegiant, SiriusXM, and Hitachi, and MuleSoft had wins at Northwell Health, 3M, and CalOptima Health. Our industry clouds continue to fuel our growth with strong demand in highly regulated industries like healthcare.\nNotably, our new Agentforce Life Science Cloud was in three of our top 10 deals in the quarter. We also saw strong momentum internationally with wins at Brenntag and Finnair. Once again, half of our top 10 wins for the quarter were international. We continue to unlock customer spend through new channels, including the AgentForce Partner Network that launched at Dreamforce, which allows customers to customize and deploy specialized agents using trusted third party extensions from Salesforce, AppExchange, and AWS Marketplace. Marketplace continues to be a growth driver. Our Q3 transactions doubled quarter-over-quarter with 10 deals exceeding $1 million.\nSalesforce's business and financial performance has delivered unprecedented results and we're doing it again with our product transformation in AgentForce. We're starting Q4 with strong momentum and no one is better positioned to capture the massive AgentForce opportunity ahead. Now over to you Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat, thanks Brian. As you heard from Marc and Brian, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with AgentForce. Simply put, Salesforce is uniquely positioned to become the leading enterprise AI platform and the source of a digital workforce for companies around the globe. And as Customer Zero for AgentForce, we're already seeing a significant pickup in case deflections for our customer service organizations. This is just the beginning of a new world of humans and AI agents working together to fundamentally reshape the economics of business. As Marc mentioned, we have been on a financial transformation over the past several years and you'll see it in our results. Q3 represents another quarter of focused execution leading to strong outcomes. Q3 revenue was $9.44 billion, up 8% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency driven by resilience in our core clouds.\nSubscription and support revenue grew 9% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in both sales and service driven by strong ARPU growth. As expected, this was partially offset by deceleration in our license revenue growth in sales, service, and Tableau in Q3 against tough prior year comps. From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 6% in nominal and constant currency, EMEA grew 12% or 9% in constant currency, and APAC grew 16% or 14% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in LATAM, Canada, and Australia, while the United States and parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective in Q3, health and life sciences, manufacturing, automotive, and energy all performed well, while retail and consumer goods were more measured.\nOur multi-cloud momentum continues with our top 25 deals averaging more than five clouds each. Now you hear us talk about this metric every quarter. It's an incredible proof point that our customers trust Salesforce to transform their entire customer experience from sales, to service, to marketing and commerce, to analytics, and integration. But our multi-cloud strategy is also core to our financial strategy. Multi-cloud customers have higher spend, lower attrition rates, and drive significant ARR expansion for us each quarter. That's because Salesforce is the only company that can deliver a 360-degree view of your customers, which is essential for every company as we move into an agent-first world.\nData Cloud also continues to be the foundation for every AI transformation, and it was included in 1/3 of all of our deals this quarter over $1 million. As you heard from Brian, Data Cloud helps unlock AI with our customers, and that's why eight of our top 10 deals included both Data Cloud and AI, inclusive of AgentForce. This is really the model for all future transactions. Q3 revenue attrition ended the quarter slightly above 8%, in line with recent quarters. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%, up 190 basis points year-over-year, driven by top line outperformance and disciplined expense management.\nI am very pleased to share that this quarter our GAAP operating margin hit 20% for the first time in company history.\nQ3 non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, inclusive of an $0.18 charge driven by mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments portfolio. Excluding this impact, non-GAAP EPS would have been $2.59, well ahead of our guidance. Q3 operating cash flow was $2 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $53.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Current RPO, or CRPO, ended at $26.4 billion, an increase of slightly more than 10% year-over-year in nominal currency. This includes a $100 million FX tailwind, which results in 10% year-over-year growth in constant currency. CRPO outperformance was driven by early renewal, favorability, and strong new bookings performance.\nOf note on the bookings performance over the past couple of quarters, we have seen stabilization in our transactional businesses, most notably create and close and F&B one call out on the Q3 CRPO results. As you heard from Marc, Agentforce's momentum in Q3 was incredible, with over 200 deals closed in only one week. However, given we are early in our adoption cycle, it is not yet a material contributor to CRPO on capital return. In Q3, we executed $1.2 billion in share repurchases and paid nearly $400 million in dividends. This brings our total return to shareholders in the quarter to $1.6 billion. Through our capital return program, we continue to expect to more than fully offset dilution from our FY 2025 stock-based compensation. I'm pleased to share that since the inception of our capital allocation program, total capital returns have now surpassed $20 billion.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Note that after the end of our third quarter, we closed our acquisitions of Own Company and Zoomin. As such, our guidance incorporates contributions from both these deals. Let's start with the full fiscal year 2025.\nOn revenue, we are raising the low end of our guidance range to $37.8 billion and maintaining the high end at $38 billion, growth of approximately 8% to 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong execution and revenue outperformance over the last two quarters. For subscription and support revenue, we still expect approximately 10% growth year-over-year in constant currency. A few reminders on our revenue guide: on FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year, or a 30 basis point impact. We continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue growth, and as we shared last quarter, our guidance incorporates deceleration in our license revenue growth in the back half of this year.\nOn attrition, we expect attrition to remain consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. Now turning to profitability and cash flow on margins, we are pleased to raise our fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 32.9%, representing a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. This incorporates intentional investments and growth opportunities, most notably in AgentForce and Data Cloud.\nAs we said last quarter, stock based compensation is still expected to be approximately 8.4% as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2025. GAAP operating margin guidance continues to be slightly below 20%, representing 540 basis points of improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year 2025 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.15 to $6.20.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.98 to 10.03. We are raising our fiscal year 2025 operating cash flow growth to approximately 24% to 26%, inclusive of cash tax headwinds, and we continue to expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This now results in free cash flow growth of approximately 26% to 28% for the fiscal year.\nNow to guidance for Q4 on revenue, we expect $9.9 to 10.1 billion, up 7% to 9% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 9% year-over-year in nominal, including a $100 million FX headwind, and slightly above 9% in constant currency. Similar to Q3, we do not expect a material contribution to CRPO from Q4 AgentForce related bookings.\nFor Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.60 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.57 to $2.62. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution this quarter, and we remain focused on driving profitable growth, optimizing free cash flow, and delivering a new era of customer success with AgentForce, which truly represents the next evolution of Salesforce. Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy. As a courtesy to everyone on the call, we ask that everyone only ask one question, please. With that, Regina, let's go to the first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon, Marc. On Asia Pacific foresight, I'm curious if you could just talk about the halo effect you're starting to see across the product lines, perhaps some of the other products getting pulled in. You mentioned Data Cloud. Can you speak to what you're seeing from that? Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOh, Brent, thanks. That's a great question. You know, Amy really hit a very subtle line in the middle of her script, and it probably requires a little more illumination, which is, you know, Amy really said to you that in our top 25 deals, we saw five. This kind of collaboration with these five clouds each. What that means to us is that our top customers are really loading in this complete agent-first cocktail. This idea that we have sales, we have service, we have marketing, we have analytics, we have our Data Cloud, we have Slack, and every customer wants these products and wants them together. You know, we have an incredible Sales Cloud, number one in the world. You know that, and it is the only agent-first Sales Cloud today. It's highly differentiated.\nWe have the number one Service Cloud in the world. Gartner just published the new Magic Quadrant. We're number one, way up and to the right. Guess what? We are now farther up and to the right because we're the only agent-first Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Analytics, Data, Slack across the board. I'll tell you a story, which is we have an incredible customer in the healthcare industry, and they recently called me in there. You're thinking about how are they going to deploy these agents and on and on and on, and it's a huge opportunity for healthcare. I can talk to you exhaustively all about that. Gave them the whole pitch, went through the whole thing, and then the next day they called us back and they said we really want to talk to you now about our Marketing Cloud choice.\nYou know, we're looking at Adobe and you know, how should we think about that? I'm like, well, we really probably should bring in our team and show you what we're doing. It's really, you have to look at the whole platform that we can do because yes, we have an incredible, incredible Marketing Cloud, and incredible email capabilities, and promotion capabilities, and on and on, and deeply integrated into our workflow. Take a look at how it operates across all of your customer channels and all of your customer touch points, and how this is one comprehensive customer suite, and it's all agent first.\nHe sent me a text and it's a very large customer and said, of course we are going with you on the marketing as well because I think when customers realize that they are going to build agent first companies that the agent needs to have a comprehensive access to this entire data set and metadata set, that we are the only ones who have built this platform. Nobody else has a comprehensive platform that does sales, service, marketing, analytics, data, cloud, Slack, all integrated together as one piece of code and operating across all languages, all currencies, and can scale from the smallest companies to the very largest in the world. That is what is unique about Salesforce.\nWe have something very special right now because, and you know Brent, because you've been covering this for a long time, we always had the best enterprise AI. Einstein is the best. You know, we've been working on that for more than a decade. Of course, we were able to, you know, put it into overdrive and deliver agents first. Because it's within the platform, everything is in the platform. This isn't some distinct, discrete piece of code. It's just another light switch on for the customer to get the full level of functionality. I couldn't be more excited about it. I'm sure it comes through on the call. I really think that for all of us, you think about Brent, how long we've been working together for decades before I started Salesforce.\nYou think about the conversation we just had on this earnings call is unlike any conversation you and I have ever had about software. We are all about to learn, grow, expand, and evolve and become a different kind of industry that's providing a different kind of value. This is the most excited I've ever been about the software industry. Thanks, Brent. Regina, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and definitely hear the excitement coming through on the call. Maybe a question for Brian. When it comes to those 200 deals that you've already signed for AgentForce, maybe if you give us some color on what those deals look like, do they tend to be upsells? What type of upload do you see if you're upselling to customers, do they tend towards like one cloud or another? How expansive? Are there any kind of color that we can use to try to kind of understand this opportunity better?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Keith, thank you for the question and a good one. We are seeing incredible traction with our customers as add-ons to many of our Service Cloud offerings. Obviously, you know, Service Cloud is our largest cloud, and our initial AgentForce opportunity is with our Service Cloud customers right now. We saw a ton of add-ons happening in our customer base with Service Cloud. What our customers also recognize is that this is a platform and the opportunity to move from, yes, of course we want to have autonomous agents that are supporting customers like we have on help.salesforce.com, but what are all the opportunities you have in your interactions, in the flow of work with your customers, where you can deploy agents? While we have tremendous excitement in the initial 200 deals, we're largely in the Service Cloud space.\nWe feel great about the opportunity with Sales Cloud, with Marketing Cloud, with Commerce Cloud, and of course with Data Cloud, which is included in all of our AgentForce deals. Those 200 deals are sort of the tip of the iceberg when we think about the opportunity that's ahead of us for AgentForce.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Regina, we'll take next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you. You're obviously creating a lot of value for your clients. Like, how's the discussion about how you kind of participate or work with the clients about pricing for AgentForce going, or like, how should we think about it? What are you hearing there? Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nI'll start. I think Marc is probably going to.\nChime in as well.\nWe're super excited about it. I would say, as you all know, it's a usage-based structure, and at $2 a conversation, we feel like the value is very high for our customers given what they're spending today in a lot of their conversations. Please.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nEverybody knows I've been wearing a boot because I ruptured my Achilles while I was on a scuba diving trip.\nTo Fakharava.\nWhich is an incredible place. The Tuamotus in French Polynesia for my birthday was having a great time. Ruptured my Achilles, unfortunately. I'm sure we all know the international motto of Fakarava, which I have close to my heart, which is I don't give a fuck, Arava. I think that I just got a call from my hospital telling me that I'm coming in to get scheduled for another MRI and incredible service. You know, everybody knows I have this great relationship with UCSF and they pay a lot of attention to me. I pay a lot of attention to them. Incredible organization. They had a lot of questions for me about getting me ready for my next MRI. At the end of the call, it's kind of preoperative care and there'll be another call post operative and so forth.\nI was just saying to myself, wow, what did that cost them? They just don't have enough people as it is. Their doctors are already burned out, their nurses are burned out. I talk to the folks all the time. You know, there's a lot of pajama time for all these doctors is what they call it, because they're all working late at night with their families, trying to get through all of their messages. Everybody's maxed out at UCSF. I mean, it's an incredible org, but I can't believe, you know, the amount that they have to do with such an actually limited workforce. You know, I got this call, I said, you know, they kind of know all of this already about me.\nThey've got all of my data, they have all of my care, they have my family history, they've got all my scans. They can have an agent do this work. That call probably cost them $100 and it didn't have to happen. I think that we could have done the call for probably about $1.50. I think that is the message to our customers, which is, how are you going to give some of your people a break, let them get back to their strategic work, let them focus on what really matters, their customers. Some of the work that's a little bit more administrative and bureaucratic and that's done by these political layers or higher levels, that's like, you know what, I think that that could have happened with an agent. That's kind of how I look at it.\nI think we're just at an incredible moment where we can really grow our country's revenue or GDP, do a lot more, have a lot more productivity without hiring a lot more people. The hospital example is the best example. Consumption pricing isn't new to Salesforce. You all know that we have our sandboxes, our Commerce Cloud, Heroku, Data Cloud, and many, many. This is a consumption product. We have per user products, you know, which are for humans. We have consumption products, you know, for agents and robots. That's how I think we should look at it, which is the comparative cost is, there's just no comparison.\nDo you want to add more to that, Brian? Yeah, I just say our customers really.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Understand the cost of their labor right now. When we can deploy agents to help them manage their interactions with their customers, the pricing conversations are significantly easier. You know, you can even see even on our website we've got calculators that allow our customers to go do the work themselves. It's been a great ad for them to go understand what the cost structures look like, and it's been an enlightenment for many of our customers to see the value that we can deliver for them with AgentForce.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nGreat, thanks, Raimo. Regina, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Software Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks so much for taking the question, Marc. I wanted to ask about the more core initiative that you mentioned in your remarks. It would seem further integrating the platform can only be a good thing for customers. Can you talk more about what's involved and the size of the prize as you come out the other side of this initiative? Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, we have been working on this now for a couple of years, really since we started our transformation, which I think maybe this call is the two year anniversary of our transformation. Is that right, Amy? I mean, it was about two years ago that we were like, whoa, we're about to go through an incredible transformation. I think we would not have gotten through that transformation without the support of all of you. I think you know that you gave us a lot of the advice, thinking, and strategy to do that. It's been an incredible 24 months. It's been a financial transformation, and it's been a technology transformation.\nYou know, now when we really think about what are the things that we really invested in, it's, you know, we really tried to look at how do we try to make our organization stronger.\nTo be able to deliver the numbers that we want to be able to do, we want to expand our distribution organization. That's something that we wish we had done faster. We're still not where we want to be there. I would say where we've made very significant investments were in AI, and I think that's evidenced by AgentForce. We also made very significant investments in more core. We've dramatically increased not only the productivity, but also the number of engineers in the company over the last two years as well. That's been an incredible focus for us. That's why we're able to deliver this technology capability. When we look at the company, I would say more core has come out of it.\nAt Dreamforce, you saw how commerce and marketing, for example, which always had been outside of the core platform, are now inside the core platform. The idea is that we want Sales, Service, Marketing, Analytics, Data Cloud, Slack, all to be in one platform. That is because we want all the workflow, the data, the metadata, all to be in one platform. The reason why is because the AI does not work if you don't have that. The AI needs this ability to look across these huge data sets and capabilities to kind of pull it all together. You can imagine that I'm on the.\nOn the phone with UCSF and I'm talking now to the agent, you know, at some point in the future, instead of talking to the person who I spoke to today and they say, you know, you still owe $500 on that last visit, which is not uncommon for me. There's some additional fee or something that I have to pay and I'll say, yes, go ahead and process that. That all just happens on our platform. The commerce can happen on the platform, the confirming email can happen on the platform, the case management can happen on the platform, the patient relationship management can happen on the platform. It can happen by industry, it can happen by geography, it can happen by currency. That is what's really, I think, unique about Salesforce.\nIt's not just that we're delivering, you know, this agent-first solution. It's the comprehensive functionality set underneath there that's all possible.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brad. Regina, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Brayson with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Brayson\n\nCo-head of Tech Research, Piper Sandler\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the new Foundations offering. This seems like a new strategic approach to multi-cloud packaging that could also drive broader agent adoption. What's been customer response to Foundations so far, and do you have any sense on what adoption might look like in the coming year?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nFoundation and when you look at other initiatives that we have, this is all coming out of more core. You know, when you look at essentials, when you look at our focus on the SMB market, when you look at kind of you're seeing the fundamental rewriting of the product in real time. It is a little bit like we are flying the airplane and rebuilding it in real time. I would joke with Martin, you know, two years ago what happened was we were flying the airplane, we found out the two pilots were gone in the front, and one person with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and we were all left on the plane. We were on the phone with all you going, well, we're going to put it all together and just trust us, going to get this done.\nYou know, while we've been doing that, not only did we land the plane successfully, but we rebuilt the whole airplane in real time. That idea that the platform itself has been rebuilt is pretty incredible. Foundations is really a glimpse at what's happening. It's the same code set, but you can see how Foundations is kind of a whole different way to use Salesforce, and we're making as much of our functionality available to all of our customers as possible. We're shipping Foundations so that every customer can get a taste of sales, service, marketing, analytics, Data Cloud, Slack, and everything that we have. We realize, and I'll include one thing I didn't mention, is platform. You know.\nIt's very important that these customers see that they don't have to go buy another best of breed product. They can just flip the switch and everything comes on, and that is working. We still have a lot of work to do to educate our customers on all the capabilities that we have. Still, a lot of our Sales Cloud customers don't have Service Cloud, and a lot of our Service Cloud customers don't have Sales Cloud. That's true of Marketing Cloud. I could go to each one of these clouds because in some ways we've been selling a lot of these clouds in their own silos, so they've built on their own customer bases. We have a lot of customers, we have a lot of software to sell to a lot of people. It's an exciting moment because we're so highly differentiated.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nGreat.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Regina, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYes, thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter, and great to hear all the excitement around AgentForce off the launch. Brian, this is probably for you. I was just curious and dovetails back into some earlier comments. Really strong attach with Data Cloud thus far. I was just kind of curious how far along are your customers in terms of having their data in order so that they can.\nGet value from AgentForce? Somewhat out of the box. I'm just trying to get a better understanding on how long does it take from the conversation with customers, sort of scouting out what they're going to do, getting their data in order, and then bringing, you know, sort of AgentForce to bear. Is it a three, six month process? Trying to get a sense if you have an idea on that quite yet, thanks.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Kirk, and I appreciate.\nVaries by customer. Honestly, if you've had a very strong data architecture strategy for many years, your ability to turn on Data Cloud, harmonize your data, and leverage it in our AI solutions is months, you know, weeks even. There are other customers who have data siloed across their business. They built data lakes, it sits across different divisions that they want to bring together in Data Cloud, and that can take a bit longer, you know, six months even to bring that data together. They all want to move faster, which is the great opportunity for us. They all recognize the need for harmonized data to make their AI and their AgentForce opportunity better with their customers.\nWhat we're seeing is tremendous demand for not only the technology, but the people to go harmonize the data, get it in a state that they can now leverage AgentForce to really deliver for their customers. It really depends honestly is the answer.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kirk, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks, and wish everyone a happy holiday season.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

At this time, we're admitting additional participants and will be starting shortly. Thank you for your patience, and please continue to stand by. Welcome to Salesforce's fiscal 2025 second quarter results conference call. If you have a question today, please press star one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP, Salesforce\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on the fiscal 2025 second quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release.\nSome of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize, or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could materially differ from these forward-looking statements.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including the most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Thanks so much, Mike, and thanks everyone for being on the call. We got so many exciting things to talk about today, and we're so excited to be with you, and we're also getting really jacked for Dreamforce. Looking forward to that. We are just going to have a great call here. A year ago on this call, we talked about two amazing transformations. We were transforming Salesforce for, as we were talking about, the short- and the long-term, which was really code words for really addressing our financials, but really looking at this incredible AI opportunity.\nNow we look at a year later, I just couldn't be more excited about how these two transformations are driving the success of the company. Really, I don't think I've been more excited about the history of Salesforce and now the future of Salesforce and how well positioned we are for the future. You can see it in our numbers with strong performance across revenue, cash flow, margin, and CRPO. The numbers are beyond my expectation in the quarter. You can see that it's pretty awesome.\nYou can also see the incredible innovation that our product and engineering teams are delivering, the success of our customers. We're going to talk about a whole different Salesforce today, a different architecture, and a product that we didn't even talk about on the last earnings call that is going to be fundamental to our future and a manifestation of our decade of AI leadership, which is Agentforce.\nJust a few weeks, we're going to kick off Dreamforce, and I hope all of you are planning to be there, the largest AI event in the world with more than 45,000 Trailblazers in San Francisco this year, Dreamforce is really becoming Agentforce. I'll tell you, it's a funny thing about Agentforce. Even one of our very top executives in engineering sent me a text last week and said, \"Hey, should we be renaming the company from Salesforce to Agentforce because we're all getting so excited about Agentforce?\" I also told Mike that I really want to make sure all of you are there and to do what he can to put together an analyst briefing at Dreamforce.\nI told him I'd pay for it to have an outstanding culinary chef, and maybe we can bring in some great entertainment for all of you to encourage you all to come. I just gave him a huge budget to really motivate everyone because I think this is going to be a moment that everyone is going to have to see in person to understand what is going on. I'm going to explain that in a second because we're going to show our new Agentforce agents and how we've reimagined enterprise software for this new world of autonomous AI. I'm going to try to get every customer who comes to Dreamforce to turn agents on while they're there.\nSo many of the customers, of course, are already using our applications. You know that, okay? Of course, we're automating all our customer touchpoints. That's our Customer 360. We've been talking now for the last couple of years about how we've really built this phenomenal Data Cloud that has really become, I would say, our fastest growing, most exciting product ever up until one that we're about to talk about, which is to help our customers amalgamate all the data that they need to really get their AI act in order that gets their data and metadata integrated and then federate to other data sources.\nThis critical third tier, which this is the first call that we've ever talked about it, which is these agents. This idea that you're not just going to have sales agents and service agents, probably read, heard, maybe saw on CBC, we're building the agents for Workday, and we're going to be building custom agents for so many of you as well with Agentforce because it is a development platform as well as this incredible capability to radically extend your sales and service organizations.\nWhen you arrive at the Dreamforce campus, you're going to see a big sign outside that says, \"Humans with agents drive customer success together.\" That's because we now so strongly believe the future isn't about having a Salesforce or a ServiceForce or a MarcetingForce or a CommerceForce or an AnalyticsForce. The future is about also having an Agentforce.\nWhile many customers today don't yet have Agentforce, but they do have Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, I assure you that within a year, we're all going to have Agentforce, and we're going to have them at scale. It's going to radically extend our companies, and it's going to augment our employees, make us more productive. It's going to turn us into these incredible margin and revenue machines. It's going to be pretty awesome. This is really the future, a new future that we can really envision.\nWith this Agentforce platform, we're making it easy to build these powerful autonomous agents for sales, for service, for Marceting, for commerce, automating the entire workflow on their own, embedding agents in the flow of work, and getting our customers to the agent future first. This is our primary goal of our company right now. This is my singular focus.\nAt Dreamforce, and on this call, you're going to hear a lot of stories already of customers, and we're going to talk about the customers who have it, customers like OpenTable, Wiley, ADP, and RBC, and so many others who are deploying these agents and running them on top of our Data Cloud and our apps. In fact, you're going to hear about at Dreamforce, you're going to hear one of the very largest healthcare companies in the world who's got 20 million consumers here in the United States who's resolving more than 90% of all patient inquiries with Agentforce. They're benchMarcing us significantly higher than any other competing AI platform.\nThat's based on some incredible AI breakthroughs that we have had at Salesforce. I just have to call out the quality of our research team, our engineering team, and our product team because the accuracy of our results, the reduction of hallucinations, and the level of capability of AI is unlike anything I think that any of us have ever seen. We've got some incredible new techniques, especially incredible new Augmented RAG techniques that are delivering us the capability to deliver this accuracy for our customers.\nIn fact, one of these very large media companies that we work with, a lot of them probably know who have everything, every possible media asset. Well, they're just resolving 90% of all of their employee and consumer issues with Agentforce. Pretty awesome. There's nothing more transformational than agents on the technology horizon that I can see. Salesforce is going to be the first company at scale to deploy enterprise agents and not just any enterprise agents, the highest quality, most accurate agents in the world.\nAll of this, with our continued focus on trust, with customer success, with innovation, is driving the results that you see today. In Q2, we've delivered $9.33 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year in nominal and 9% in constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew at 9% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. For the 11th year in a row, Salesforce ranked number one CRM provider by the IDC software tracker. Of course, Salesforce is the number one AI CRM. We like to say we're the third largest enterprise software company, but I was doing some calculations today, and I'd like you guys to do the calculations.\nI think we just became the second largest enterprise software company because we're not delivering infrastructure or hardware. We already passed Oracle in Japan as the second largest enterprise software company. I think we just did that. If you look at our enterprise software overall, we're the largest enterprise software company in the world. We continue to see growth in multi-cloud deals. In fact, multi-cloud deals accounted for close to 80% of our new business in the quarter.\nWe're just operating at this incredible scale, delivering 25 trillion Einstein transactions across all of the clouds during the quarter. That's 25 trillion. More than a trillion workflows are now managing 250 petabytes of data for our customers. We also continue to deliver on this incredible margin growth and so many of you have guided us through that incredible transformation. I just want to thank all of you for that.\nFor the second quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.7%. That's up 210 basis points year-over-year. You can see the incredible transformation that we've gone through over the last 24 months in margin and cash flow, which also was $892 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Now let's turn to this financial guidance. For the fiscal year 2025, we continue to expect revenue at $37.7 to 38 billion, a growth of 8-9% year-over-year, and subscription and support revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year in constant currency. As you can see from our results, we've remained committed to this very profitable growth at this incredible level of scale.\nWe're raising our fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to 32.8%, a 230 basis points improvement year-over-year. As I told you last quarter, we're delivering incredible record cash flow this year. I'm pleased that we're also raising our operating cash flow guidance to 23-25% year-over-year. I'm also extremely proud of our team's focus and determination to deliver these great results, and we're going to hear more in a second. As you know, and as you probably can tell from my narrative already, AI is not only my top of mind, but I can tell you because I've met with hundreds of customers this quarter that it is the top of mind for every customer, for every CEO, for every CIO.\nI want to tell you, before I get into this, that I think that there's a lot of misconceptions about AI with my customers. I have been out there very disappointed with the huge amount of money that so many of these customers have wasted on AI. They are trying to DIY their AI. It's not so unlike when we first saw cloud emerge or even other technologies where they feel like they have to roll their own, build it themselves, get in the weeds, try to figure out, and they're not going to do it better than we're going to do it. We're a professional enterprise software company. That's what we do and we do it with the trust and scale that they need.\nThis idea that our customers are going to have to build their own models, train their own models, retrain their own models, retrain them again. I'm meeting with these customers, and they're so excited when they meet with me, and they say, \"Oh, I built this model, and we're resolving 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% of this or that and whatever.\" I'm like, \"Really? Well, take a look at our models and our capability where you don't have to train or retrain anything, and you're going to get more than 90%.\" Then they say, \"Wait a minute, how do you do that?\" This is a moment where every customer needs to realize you don't need to DIY your AI.\nYou can use a platform like Salesforce to get the highest efficacy of artificial intelligence, the best capability to fully automate your company, achieve all of your goals, and you can do it with professional enterprise software. I've now met with so many of these customers to really explain and to help them understand this transformative power of AI. We've all said, \"Okay, we've never seen a technology evolve at such a rapid pace.\" At the last 18 months, we're moving from having these basic pre-programmed chatbots. Now we can really see we're delivering these intelligent conversational capabilities, these agents. It's awesome.\nWe've created an out-of-the-box platform to deliver all of this for them. This could be service reply recommendations, account summaries, report generation you've seen in Slack, this auto-summarization, recaps, all of these amazing things. The level of automation, the amount of code that our team has written, the transformation of our platform in the last 18 months, it's reMarcable. Customers love it because they can take the platform and then all of this generative AI use case, customize it for their own needs or configure it using our capability because they're doing that without writing a lot of code. It's clicks, not code. Deploy them in days, not weeks.\nThey're doing this in months, not years. You're getting immediate ROI. The stories are awesome. While customers have loved seeing the power of generative AI, even like I was using generative AI last night to write some new ads for what we're going to do to kind of bring Agentforce across. It's so cool and so awesome. To have it right inside the platform makes it very real for our customers who have to manage and share all of their information to keep it trusted, to keep it secure, to be able to provide capabilities in a regulatory environment.\nThey all want this huge breakthrough that's going to give them much more productivity, augmentation of their employees, and scale like I've been talking about. We're seeing that breakthrough occur because with our new Agentforce platform, we're going to make a quantum leap forward in AI and that's why I want you all at Dreamforce, because I want you to have your hands on this technology to really understand this. This is not Copilots. So many customers are so disappointed in what they bought from Microsoft with Copilots because they're not getting the accuracy and the response that they want.\nMicrosoft is disappointing so many customers with AI. These agents are autonomous, they're able to act with accuracy, they're able to come right out of the box, they're able to go right out of the platform. When you come to Dreamforce, I'm sure that you're going to get to San Francisco. You're going to jump in a Waymo. I think they've got like 500 Waymos now in San Francisco. It's pretty awesome. I use it myself. You know what? That's like Agentforce. We're like a Waymo for your customer information and for automating your company. That is, it's autonomous. It's going to get you to where you need to get to.\nYes, we're still going to have humans in our companies, but we're also going to have these agents. These agents don't require a conversational prompt to take action. You can do advanced planning, reasoning with minimal human input. In the example of this incredible healthcare company, you're going to be able to say to the agent, \"Hey, I want to look at my labs. I want to understand this. Oh, it looks like I need repeat labs. Can you reschedule those for me? Oh, it looks like I need to see my doctor. Can you schedule that for me? I also want to get an MRI. I want to get this.\"\nThe level of automation that we're going to be able to provide and unleash the productivity back into these organizations is awesome. Why that's important for this healthcare organization or for all of them that we're working with, since the pandemic, these doctors and nurses are just so burnt out, and there's so much activity for them that we're just going to unleash that productivity back to them. Let the agent handle this simple task and let the doctors and the nurses do what they're going to do best and that is going to be a powerful moment.\nThis is going to be like having these trusted colleagues can handle these time-consuming tasks, engaging with these, whether it's inbound lead or resolving this customer patient inquiry or whatever it is. This is humans with agents driving customer success together. Agentforce agents can be set up in minutes, easily scalable, work around the clock, any language.\nBy the beginning of next fiscal year, we will have thousands of customers using this platform. We will have helped them to make it successful for them, deploy it. The early trials have been reMarcable. To see these customers have the success, it has been just awesome. Let me give you a great example, Wiley. Now, it's back-to-school season. Wiley is a long-standing Salesforce customer. It's one of our first deployments in the first Agentforce trial. It's pretty awesome and you all know they make textbooks, and it's back-to-school. Maybe you don't know that Wiley has to surge their sales and service organization at back-to-school time when everyone's buying these textbooks.\nNow, they can use agents to do that surge. They don't have to go buy a bunch of gig workers and bring them in. That agent capacity is so exciting for them that what we saw with Wiley was, this is a quote from them, \"We're seeing double-digit percentage increase in customer satisfaction and deflection rate compared to older technologies in these early weeks of our busiest season.\" That was very reassuring to us that we have the right thing that's happening.\nWiley's already seen a 50% increase in case resolution. That's with our first generation of Agentforce, as I mentioned, the second generation of Agentforce, which we have with customers already, including some of these amazing organizations like Royal Bank of Canada, ADP, and others. There's 90% case resolution. It is an awesome moment in this tech business. OpenTable is another super great story. You all know they are managing 60,000 restaurants, 160 million diners to support. They're on Agentforce now.\nThey require that incredible scale to deliver top-notch customer service, that's why they're using the product. It's been awesome to get their results. It can be all kinds of questions resolving basic issues, account reactivations, reservation management, and loyalty point expiration. Agentforce for Service can easily answer all of these questions like, \"When do my points expire?\" If a diner asks a follow-up question like, \"What about in Mexico? Can I make this change?\" That's where we're delivering those incredible moments for OpenTable, giving them this productivity enhancement.\nIn addition to this amazing capability, Agentforce for Service, now Agentforce for Sales, you can imagine extending your Salesforce with SDRs and BDRs, who are agents that are going out and building pipeline for you and generating all kinds of demand and even really closing deals. This is going to drive Sales Cloud growth. It already is. Service Cloud growth. It already is because customers are going to extend their sales and service organizations and become a lot more productive with these agents.\nIn the coming months, we're going to release Agentforce agents for other roles, including industry-specific agents, health agents, as I mentioned, medical, answering all kinds of medical questions, as I mentioned. We already have that in trial with this amazing healthcare company, sorry, one of the largest ethnic databases in the world. I just can't believe we're already resolving, as I said, 90% of these patient inquiries.\nThis Marcs a very significant advance in providing this reliable, trusted AI. We're really seeing a transformation of Salesforce. We're still going to automate all these human touchpoints. We're still going to have our commerce sites. We're still going to have our analytics and visualization capability of managing it. We're still going to have humans who are sales organizations, service organizations, but we are going to extend it all with this incredible agent capability.\nAll of this type of performance from our Agentforce platform wouldn't be possible without Data Cloud. One of the reasons that our agents are so accurate is because of the huge amount of data and metadata that we had. Data is the foundation for every AI transformation. With Data Cloud, we're providing a high-performance data lake that brings together all our customer and business data, federating data from external repositories through this incredible zero-copy alliance. Customers can use our Data Cloud and then federate and connect to all their other data clouds, and then we can bring it all together to deliver this super accurate AI.\nThat's why Data Cloud is absolutely our fastest growing organic product in history. It'll be the fastest product to a billion. It's going to probably be the fastest product to $5 billion, $10 billion. In Q2, the number of paid Data Cloud customers grew 130% year-over-year, and the number of customers spending more than $1 million annually has already doubled. In the second quarter alone, and this is amazing, Data Cloud processed 2.3 quadrillion records with 110% platform consumption growth year-over-year. That is awesome. Just amazing. The scale and capability.\nAgain, for customers who don't have that turned on yet and working at Dreamforce, we're going to focus on getting every customer onto Data Cloud. For the last 25 years, Salesforce has been deeply committed to building the most capable CRM apps that help our customers connect with their customers in this whole new way. We've automated every customer touchpoint, and now we're bringing these apps, data, and agents together. It's these three levels. This isn't three separate pieces of code or three different platforms or three different systems. This is one platform.\nWe've rewritten all of our acquisitions, all of our core modules, our Data Cloud, and our agents as one unified platform, which is how we are delivering not only this incredible functionality, but this high level of accuracy and capability. From this firsthand experience of meeting with these customers around the globe, I can unequivocally tell you that building these agents without a complete integrated platform is like trying to assemble a plane mid-flight. It's risky, chaotic, and it's not likely to succeed.\nI just got back from a Dreamforce focus group where I met with one of the largest CIOs in the world. He was telling me how excited he was for the B2C part of his business. He built this model and the accuracy rates. I was like, \"Really? Let me show you what we're doing here.\" He said to me, \"Why am I doing this? Why am I not just using your platform?\" I said, \"Good question.\" These customers are spending millions of dollars, but are they really getting the results that they want? It feels like this early days of cloud. It's this early days of social and mobile. Customers feel like they have to DIY it.\nThey don't need to. They can make it all happen themselves. You can just see that to deliver this very high-quality capability, they can use a deeply integrated platform like Salesforce. With that, let me just move on to Dreamforce and just say, I hope you're going to be able to come to Dreamforce. I'm going to try to encourage everyone to do it. I've told Mike, I really want all the analysts there. I want everybody there, all the investors there. We're going to try to give you the highest quality experience to encourage you to do that. You'll be hearing the details from Mike on that shortly. You're not going to want to miss it, but you're mostly not going to want to miss it because you're going to want to get your hands on this techno\nlogy. This is the first time that you're going to see how AI really is going to revolutionize these enterprises. Before I hand it off to Brian, I just want to take a moment to thank Amy Weaver. It has been an incredible 11 years for all of us who work with Amy. She's been an amazing leader across many different parts of our organization, is a deeply valued member of our Ohana. She's been a fantastic partner to me personally. Over the last few years in particular, Amy has spearheaded our financial transformation, resulting in an unprecedented margin expansion, increased operational excellence, financial discipline, continued strategic investments.\nSalesforce today is better positioned than ever with a phenomenal platform for growth. Luckily for us, Amy is basically going through this amazing transformation with us and now getting ready to go to the next level in her own career. She will step down at the end of the fiscal year, at the end of February or March and then she will stay with us, I think, until May of 2027 to help onboard the new CFO.\nLet me just riff on this for just a second. I've had the opportunity to work with so many great executives at Salesforce. Amy is our fifth CFO. I think all of you know that we've had some great leaders, and we've been fortunate to build our company with some great folks. I remember Andy, Steve Cakebread, Graham, Marc, and then Amy has been just incredible how she's taken the financials to another level. It's been awesome to work with her. When she originally came to the company 11 years ago, she came in as our general counsel. I think there's been a handful of general counsels who've been able to make the transformation. I always felt that Amy could do it.\nI have to say it was my idea that Amy should move from general counsel to being CFO. She has exceeded my expectations. We've hired Heidrick & Struggles and our good friend Jeff Sanders to run a search. We're reviewing internal candidates and external candidates. We're going to do a comprehensive search. Amy is going to lead that with me. We're going to find another world-class person to be our sixth CFO, which will be awesome. If you have people that you know that you're interested in this position, it's a great job, right Amy?\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nIt's fantastic.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nPays well too, doesn't it?\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nIt's just fine.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nGood job satisfaction overall. Get all these great events to go to. Anyway, let your folks know they can contact Jeff. We're looking for that world-class executive to become CFO number six. We couldn't be more grateful to you, Amy, for everything that you do for us every single day, for all that you do in the middle of the pandemic when we couldn't even meet in person.\nYou took over as CFO, you led us through the pandemic, you exited the pandemic, now you're helping us to execute this AI transformation, which is so exciting. We couldn't be more thrilled. Congratulations, Amy. Thank you so much for everything again, for everything that you have done for the company and for me personally. With a huge sense of gratitude, I'm going to turn it over to you, Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThank you, Marc. It's certainly hard to follow that. I want to. It really is. All of that, but particularly the Amy part. I want to echo your comments on Amy, an unbelievable leader who's been an amazing partner to me, an example and role model to so many at our company. I'm just so glad that we have more time with Amy as we work on this transition. I want to start by thanking the team for their strong execution as we continue to operate at tremendous scale and sophistication.\nAs the results show in the quarter, we continue to execute on our core growth pillars, the strong momentum in multi-cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, Salesforce ecosystem, and data and AI innovations across all of our clouds. As you heard from Marc, we're innovating faster than ever. Our new Agentforce platform, which will be generally available in October, is a game changer for our customers and a huge opportunity for us going forward.\nThe feedback I've heard from the pilot customers like Wiley, OpenTable, and Fossil has been overwhelmingly positive. Agentforce is a deeply integrated platform combining our core metadata framework and Data Cloud and Einstein and extending the power of our Customer 360 apps in ways that we didn't think possible a year ago, reducing costs, scaling workforces, and dramatically improving customer and employee experiences, all without the headaches of complex, costly model training or DIY AI projects.\nWe're already accelerating this move from AI hype to AI reality for thousands of customers with amazing capabilities across our entire AI product portfolio. New bookings for these products more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We signed 1,500 AI deals in Q2 alone. Some of the world's largest brands are using AI solutions, including Alliant, Bombardier, and CMA CGM.\nBombardier, the maker of some of the world's top-performing aircrafts, is enabling sales reps to sell smarter by consolidating need-to-know information on prospects in advance of meetings and providing recommendations on how to best engage with them through the Einstein Copilot and Prompt Builder. The next steps for these companies, of course, will be deploying agents to drive even more automation and productivity. With AI technologies advancing so rapidly, it's been really challenging for our customers to keep pace.\nEach of our customers is certainly at a different stage of their AI journey. They're relying on Salesforce as their trusted advisor, their partner with them in this new world where humans and AI are working together. To help our customers navigate this new world, we just launched a new team called Salesforce CTOs. These are deeply technical individuals who work alongside our customers to help them create and execute a plan for every stage of their AI journey to become agent-first companies. We're continuing our own AI journey internally as a customer zero of all of our products with great results.\nWe now have 35,000 employees using Einstein as a trusted AI assistant, helping them work smarter and close deals faster. Since we launched Slack AI in February, our employees have created more than 500,000 channel summaries, saving nearly 3 million hours of work. We'll, of course, deploy Agentforce agents soon in a variety of different roles and tasks to augment, automate, and deliver productivity and unmatched experiences for all employees and customers at scale. Echoing what Marc said about Data Cloud, it continues to be highly strategic for our customers as they build foundations for infusing AI across their enterprises.\nAmerican Family Insurance, with millions of policyholders nationwide, is using Data Cloud to consolidate data from multiple sources through our zero-copy partner network, creating a 360-degree view of our customers, enabling quick segmentation and activating lead data, including their real-time web interactions. The Adecco Group expanded their Data Cloud in the quarter, a great example of a company leveraging its gold mine of data to gain a unified view of its customers. Connecting all this data means that 27,000 Adecco employees using Salesforce will have seamless access to key information, including financial metrics and job fulfillment status, to help Adecco improve their job fill rate ratio and reduce their cost to serve.\nIn all my conversations with CEOs this quarter, it's clear that we've never been more relevant, especially as companies transition to become AI enterprises. That's why customers continue to trust Salesforce across their most critical touchpoints with their customers, leading to strong multi-cloud deals in the quarter. As Marc said, nearly 80% of our new business in the quarter was driven by multi-cloud deals. Companies like Wyndham Hotels & Resorts are all in on Salesforce.\nThey're using us for Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, Marceting Cloud, Data Cloud, Einstein, and MuleSoft to transform its guest experience into a seamless end-to-end journey built in a single interface. Wyndham utilizes Data Cloud to unify profiles of 165 million guest records, many of which were duplicates across many sources like Amazon Redshift and the Sabre reservation system, as well as Sales Cloud, Marceting Cloud, and Service Cloud. MuleSoft allows Wyndham to unlock business-critical data from various platforms and onboard future franchisees faster.\nWith Einstein-generated recommended service replies, average call times have been reduced, and service agents can focus on higher priority work. Slack continues to perform well with wins at Citadel, Converge ICT, and GEICO. For the quarter, 82 of the Fortune 100 now use Slack Connect every week to better connect with their customers and their partners. In Q2, Slack AI summarized 420 million Slack messages, and customers have built 13,000 AI apps across their organizations in the last 12 months with Slack. Slack is the conversational interface where humans and agents can come together.\nTableau and MuleSoft had solid quarters with Tableau wins at the U.S. Department of the Interior, RBC Wealth Management, and Chewy, and MuleSoft wins at Veeam, US Foods, and East Carolina University. Moving on to our international business, five of our top 10 deals came from our international teams with wins at Ferrari, Sixth Street, and Commonwealth of Australia. We saw particular strength in Japan, India, and Canada. We had strong momentum in our industry's business as well, and we continue to help our customers save time and money with industry-specific solutions. More than half of our top 100 deals included one of our industry clouds in the quarter.\nWe continue to innovate on our industry AI capabilities. At Dreamforce, we're excited to share our new AI toolkit, industry toolkit, which features more than 100 ready-to-use customizable AI-powered actions. All of these actions can be applied to build industry-specific agents with Agentforce. Salesforce partners continue to drive our growth by helping us drive success at scale, improving time to value, and amplifying our growth in new ways.\nOur continued focus on go-to-market channel diversification is working well. In fact, in the quarter, three of our top 10 deals closed through the AWS marketplace. As Marc mentioned, we're just at the beginning of building an Agentforce ecosystem with companies able to build agents on our platform for their workforce and use cases. We're excited to have Workday as our first Agentforce partner.\nIn closing, I want to thank the team again. I'm really pleased with the execution in Q2. Dreamforce is just around the corner, and I can't wait to welcome all of you, either in person or virtually, to see for yourself how humans and agents are working together to create new levels of customer success, and the next generation of CRM. Now over to you, Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Marc, Brian, thank you so much for all of the kind words. It has been such a privilege to work with both of you, Mike, the entire team of hardworking, dedicated, and compassionate employees at Salesforce. Marc, special thanks to you for your confidence in me and everything you saw. I will never forget you calling me more than four years ago for the CFO role, I've rarely been so surprised in my life.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nit has been so soon.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nIt's been extraordinary. I also want to thank all of you, our investment community, and in particular, our shareholders, for your continued support of Salesforce. It's been a pleasure working with you on our transformation journey over the last few years. Since my first day as CFO, my focus has been on transforming our business to deliver profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. In that time, I am so proud of what we've accomplished, and I look forward to cheering Salesforce on for years to come.\nMoving to the quarter, I want to echo Brian and thank the team for their dedication and very strong execution in Q2. Our focus on profitable growth and our disciplined investment strategy led to strong results. Q2 revenue was $9.33 billion, up 8% year-over-year in nominal and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by resilience in our core products, licensed revenue outperformance, and a better than expected professional services.\nSubscription and support revenue grew 9% year-over-year in nominal and 10% in constant currency. As a reminder, Q1 had benefited from the timing of licensed revenue in the leap year, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter headwind to Q2 revenue growth. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 7% or 8% in constant currency. EMEA grew 11% in both nominal and constant currency, and APAC grew 9% or 16% in constant currency.\nWe saw strong new business growth in Japan, India, and Canada, while the U.S. and parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q2, public sector, HLS, and comms and media performed well, while travel, transportation, and hospitality, and manufacturing, automotive, and energy were more constrained. Our subscription support revenue was driven by another quarter of double-digit constant currency growth in both Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, primarily driven by growth in our core due to premium mix shift and pricing discipline.\nAs you've heard from Brian, multi-cloud continues to be a powerful growth lever for us. In Q2, around 16,000 customers added a new cloud, and more than 4,500 of those customers added two or more clouds. We continue to see strong momentum in Data Cloud, which remains one of our fastest-growing organic innovations. In Q2, our number of paid customers grew 130% year-over-year, and the number of customers spending more than $1 million annually nearly doubled. Q2 revenue attrition ended the quarter at around 8%, in line with recent quarters.\nWe are continuing to drive leverage across our business with Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 33.7%, a record, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by top-line outperformance and expense discipline. We are driving strong cash flow due to our profitable growth trajectory. Q2 operating cash flow was $892 million, up 10% year-over-year. Q2 free cash flow was $755 million, up 20% year-over-year. Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, RPO ended Q2 at $53.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\nCurrent RPO, or CRPO, ended at $26.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year in nominal currency. This includes a $300 million FX headwind, which results in slightly above 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency. CRPO outperformance was driven largely by bookings execution, as well as early renewal favorability. On capital return, I'm happy to say that in Q2, we executed $4.3 billion in share repurchases and issued nearly $400 million in dividends. This brings our total return to shareholders in the quarter to $4.7 billion, a record-high quarterly return. As a result, we now expect a more than fully offset dilution from FY 2025 stock-based compensation.\nNow, let's turn to guidance, starting with the full fiscal year 2025. On revenue, we are holding our guidance at $37.7-38 billion, growth of approximately 8-9% year-over-year. A few items to note on our revenue guide. First, on the buying environment, we are assuming that the conditions we've been experiencing over the past few years persist. On FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year, or a 30 basis points impact.\nWe continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue. We expect deceleration in our licensed revenue growth in the back half of the year. This is due to the tough compare from very strong performance last year and the volatility of licensed revenue recognition. For subscription support revenue, we still expect approximately 10% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We expect attrition to remain generally consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. Now, turning to profitability and cash flow.\nOn margins, as a result of our strong Q2 performance, we are raising our fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to 32.8%, representing a 230 basis points improvement year-over-year. This incorporates intentional investments and growth opportunities, notably AI and Agentforce, data, and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is now expected to be 8.4% as a percent of revenue. The modest increase from our prior guidance is primarily a result of the mechanical ESPP reset.\nAs a result, for fiscal year 2025, GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be slightly below 20%, representing 530 basis points of improvement year-over-year, which includes a slight increase in restructuring charges from our ongoing cost transformation. We expect fiscal year 2025 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.05-6.13. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $10.03-10.11.\nAs you have heard us emphasize over the last few quarters, we are focused on driving continued free cash flow expansion. As a result of our discipline capital deployment, we are raising fiscal year 2025 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 23-25% inclusive of cash tax headwinds. We now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This now results in free cash flow growth of approximately 25-27% for the fiscal year.\nNow, the guidance for Q3. On revenue, we expect $9.31-9.36 billion, up 7% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q3 is expected to be 9% year-over-year in nominal, including a $100 million FX tailwind. This will result in approximately 8.5% constant currency growth. This is inclusive of a 1-point quarter-over-quarter headwind from the very significant deal we closed in Q3 last year.\nAs a reminder, while we have seen more normalized bookings growth recently, CRPO will continue to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the previous two years of measured sales performance. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.41-1.43, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.42-2.44. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution this quarter as we continue to focus on profitable growth and optimizing free cash flow. I want to thank our employees and our shareholders for their continued support.\nI hope you're able to participate in Dreamforce and see our new Agentforce platform and all of the incredible innovation happening at Salesforce, whether in person or virtually. Before we open up the calls for questions, though, I am going to send it back to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThanks so much, Amy. Congratulations again on this amazing transition and the success. You know you're an awesome general counsel. You're an even better CFO. Now we have Sebastian, who's you know delivering the general counsel capability, sitting here at the table with us. I can't wait to see who you're going to bring in as the next CFO. This next thing, I wish I didn't have to say to all of you, but I am going to, I have a heavy heart. I think all of you know that we lost two amazing board members this quarter with Sandy and Susan. We are all still processing our grief.\nWe are all extremely sad. It's beyond anything that we have experienced as a company or as individuals to have to say goodbye to these two amazing people. Our hearts and our spirits and our souls are with them. Also, our condolences are with their families, amazing families, amazing people. They did so much for our company. They were not just great board members, not just great leaders of our industry, but they were also great friends of the company, but also personally.\nThey did so much for me, so am so greatful for them and I miss them every single day. I'm sorry that I have to say this on the call because this is the least favorite part of what I do but I just want to tell everyone how much I love Sandy and Susan and how much I miss them. I'm turning it over to you, Mike.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thank you, Operator. We'll take the first question, please.\nThank you. That question comes from Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Congratulations on a really solid quarter. Amy, really heartbroken to see you going. It's been great working with you over the past four years as CFO. You've done an amazing job in the role. Two-part question. One on the growth equation for Salesforce. A lot of excitement around the generative AI and the new AI capabilities and expanding portfolio there, we're all really excited about.\nThere's a lot of other parts of the equation that are adding to growth, whether it's industry cloud, international expansion, or multi-cloud solution. It may be a question for Brian. Can you help us understand how to build up the growth equation? Where are you guys getting those points of growth? When does GenAI become a more material contributor there? The second question is around pricing.\nWith agents coming into the picture with productivity gains, 90% deflection rates, investors are going to worry about the number of seats being used coming down with those productivity gains. How does the pricing change to account for that so Salesforce still gets the value from these solutions on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nLet me open it up and then turn it over to Brian. You know because you are right, this is just a moment. It's an exciting moment. It is all about growth. It's all about innovation. Those are two of our specialties here at Salesforce. I think when we think about growth, for the last 25 years, I'd say we're mostly focused on selling our apps and doing the services around those. We're going to continue to sell our apps and we are. You can see in the quarter, we sold a lot of apps. Not just selling our apps, but also we're selling our Data Cloud as well. Now we're selling our agents.\nNot just as core platforms, but also through our verticals, which have been some of our highest performing capabilities in the company. You're also right that there are international regions that are growing at incredible rates. We see that in Asia. We also see that in other parts of the world as well, where we continue to see, like, this double-digit growth. That has been very inspiring to us. It's really a combination of these three things: the total transformation of the technology stack, the verticalization of that stack, and that international growth, these three really core levels of growth. In my mind, I'm going to turn it over to Brian to give you the detail.\nNumber two, on pricing. When you think about apps and you think about humans, because humans use apps, not in all cases. For example, the Data Cloud is a consumption product. The Commerce Cloud is a consumption product. Of course, the email product, the Marceting Cloud is a consumption product. Heroku is a consumption product. Of course, we've had non-human consumption-based products for quite a long time at Salesforce. In this idea of agents, I'll just give you my own personal goal, I'm not giving any guidance here. My goal is that by the end of fiscal year 2026, that we will have a billion agents.\nAlready, in just looking at the number of consumers identified just in the trials that we have going on, we have 100 million identified or more, call it 200 million. The funny thing is, of course, it's only one agent. Let's just think it's like a manifestation of all these agents talking to all these consumers. When we look at pricing, it will be on a consumption basis. When we think about that, we think about saying to our customers, and we have, it's about $2 per conversation. That is how we think about it, that we're going to have a lot of agents out there, even though it's only one agent. It's a very high margin opportunity, as you can imagine.\nYou have to think about these agents. They are like, \"This is the new website. This is your new phone number. This is how your customers are going to be connecting with you in this new way.\" We're going to be helping our customers to manage these conversations. It's probably a per-conversational charge, is a good way to look at it or we're selling additional consumption credits like we do with our Data Cloud. It's a very exciting moment. I'll turn it over to Brian as well.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks for the question, Keith. I appreciate your knowledge of all of our growth strategies here around multi-cloud deals and international acceleration, product, and pricing. I think it's important not to lose track of the fact that these new innovations around Agentforce and Data Cloud and AI make all of our core apps that much better. Even in the context of Service Cloud that you're referencing here, our customers are looking at their all-in cost of running a call center.\nWhen you bring a technology that allows you to scale and drive efficiencies in operating that call center, and it's on our technology, we're excited about those conversations because we think we get to monetize all of that incredible innovation through the all-in cost there. There are a couple of other things I think you should know about. Certainly, our channel diversification, as we think about scale and international business, either through resellers. A big upside for us, I believe, is our AWS Marcetplace is a driver going forward.\nI mentioned in the comments earlier that three of our top 10 deals went through the Marcetplace, so a big opportunity there. Maybe another one that we haven't talked as much about, but is a big focus for us as we get into the second half of this year and beyond, is how do we look at managing our attrition more aggressively going forward as a way to drive growth?\nHow do we make sure that we are driving more adoption, more feature usage, more value derived from our technology to deliver more value to customers so that they get growth off of inefficiencies using our technology? Many inputs, many of them but as Marc said, this is a new era and we're excited about the future and the value we can deliver to our customers.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next up is Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMarc, you've made my heart feel heavy as well with Sandy. You might know I used to work for Sandy a long time ago, so prayers with you. Back to the business, congrats on the quarter. Amy, unbelievable. I do not know anybody who was a chief legal officer and became a successful CFO and led the company through a transformation. You'll go down in history as a very unique person in that regard. One macro thing, Marc, you've been through so many cycles before. Do you think rate reductions and post-elections it might be more conducive selling environment at a high level?\nAlso, the micro question with AI, clearly, the debate is it's going to create so much productivity that we need fewer people. Clearly, your idea is that we're going to float agents out there. How confident are you that based on everything that you've seen so far, that the world might not need more seats and that you don't have to be entirely dependent only on consumption, that this might actually further penetration of seats? It might be about who is not using AI and they're going to be losers versus people that are using AI. How does this play out in your view?You've been through a cloud battle and all that, so I love your perspective. Thank you.\nThanks, Kash. Yes, our hearts are with Sandy's family and with his wife, Nancy, and his daughters. Thank you for saying that so much. I think let me just tell you two quick stories. I told you one already in the script, which is we're working with this very large healthcare organization. It's been our lifelong dream to be able to do more with this company. They are a large Epic user. They have a huge EMR system. We do a lot on patient relationship management, which is just keeping in touch with their customers but this is different.\nWhat happens now is, we all have this experience. We go get our labs done. They draw your blood. You get your numbers and then you get a number. You're in Epic. It says, \"Oh, oh, this is out of range. This isn't right. This seems higher or lower than it was before. I need to talk to my doctor right now.\" After the pandemic, everyone's health anxiety is just a lot higher. Doctors just get a lot more calls. Nurses are just far more active than ever before. What happens is these doctors and nurses are facing a lot of burnout. You can talk to any major health care organization. We work with them all.\nIn this case, this Agentforce is now resolving in this trial 90%, more than 90% of these patient inquiries. You can imagine for these doctors and nurses not getting these calls, how that is but Agentforce is more than that. It's not just saying, \"Hey, my cholesterol is high, or this is happening,\" or whatever. It also, you're saying, \"What's my next step?\" It said, \"I would like to reschedule a doctor's appointment for you. Oh, I want to get labs redrawn for you in 30 days,\" which is a common technique that a doctor will say is, \"Oh, yeah, that lab, that may not be accurate. Let's just retest.\" Or, \"You know what? This requires you to get an MRI or a CT scan and I've scheduled that for you.\"\nAll of that is happening through the agent. You can imagine every health care company, every hospital, every organization of the world needing that. That's not what we do today exactly. That's not exactly where our business is. This is a huge new opportunity for us to now come in and say, \"Yes, we're going to do patient relationship management with our Health Cloud.\" We're still going to help coordinate, communicate, and connect with all your patients. Now, we're also helping to just dramatically improve the productivity of your organization.\nAnother example is a very large computer hardware company is doing a major acquisition and huge customer of ours. They're reconceptualizing their whole business. They want to just look at where do they want to be in terms of how they're selling and servicing their customers in five years. I said to the CEO, it's been a long time with him. I've known him for a long time, \"Hey, we're going to build you an agent-first organization. You're going to be agent-first in sales and agent-first in service. We're going to turn you into a margin machine and that's the goal of this implementation.\" That is not a conversation that I've had with a customer for exactly like that.\nYes, we're going to continue to automate their whole organization but we have to not just build them a great sales force, service force, marketing force, commerce force, analytics force, or whatever. We have to build them an Agentforce. That is, we're going from today's 0% market share in agents. Obviously, our goal is to be the agent supplier to our customers, which it has to be deeply integrated into our data and our apps. These agents, at some point, are going to say, actually, I want to pass you off to a human now to talk and complete this. There's a seamless automatic handshake between our agents and our apps because it's just one platform, by the way.\nIt's one database, one platform, seamless handshake. It's one integrated system. That's a pretty big thought. I think we can really take our customer's capabilities to a whole new level. This is just a part of technology that's just never existed before. I'm excited about this, Kash. I have always been excited about our apps. I have obviously been very excited about our data cloud. Now I'm very excited about the agents and how it all wraps together and how it leverages our decade of AI experience. How our team has executed on this opportunity has just been remarkable.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kash. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Next is Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi. Yes, thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on a nice quarter and Amy, thanks so much for all your efforts over the last four years. It's been a pleasure working with you. Marc, one of the questions I have for you is, obviously, one of the challenges with AI from an enterprise perspective has been the complexity, the security risks, you've brought this up before. How quickly can existing customers get up and running with Agentforce? Is Data Cloud a prerequisite for driving value or is that just something that sort of takes it to another level? Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nIt's a great question. And the CSAT scores on Agentforce right in this kind of trials have been extremely high, I think four out of five. Customers can get going almost immediately and we're going to prove that for them at Agentforce. We're going to go out there and we're going to, through our world tours and all of our programs, which are going to be Agentforce tours, we're going to go hand in hand and work to implement tens of thousands of customers over the next six months.\nStep one was building the platform that is deeply integrated. While Data Cloud makes it all a lot better, you do not need Data Cloud to make it work but we encourage it because you're just going to get so much better accuracy and you need this anyway. The new version of Tableau, which we've already been showing, which is awesome, is built on Data Cloud. You hit a button, and it fully visualizes everything. You have all your agents are working. Your salespeople are working. Your service people are working. You're sending out these emails.\nYou're conducting commerce on your website and then you hit a button and boom, Tableau visualizes all of it for you and it's all one integrated platform. That's really our vision of where it's going. I think that that is very compelling for our customers. When we bought these companies, starting with ExactTarget and Demandware and Tableau, we didn't really, really sure, even Slack, are we going to really integrate rewrites? Do we really need to? The loosely coupled was working really well.\nNow, with the shift to AI, it just became clear 18 months ago, we need to hit the accelerator pedal and rewrite all these things onto the core platform because customers are going to get this incredible value by having one integrated system. It scales from small companies to extremely large companies. That is what I am super excited about. We just brought all of our 500 top executives together. We showed how we've changed all of our products. I think everyone was just stunned.\nI'm looking forward to showing that at Dreamforce because I think customers will just be so motivated, not only at the quality of the new apps, which are all AI-driven, but also that they're able to extend it with these incredible new capabilities, which are indeed huge growth drivers for us going forward. By the way, also huge points of differentiation. The last point is this. These customers, you know, they're still going to build models but it's in our platform. They're still going to fine-tune those models in our platform.\nThey're going to still use our AI studios and build their own prompts in our platform. All of it runs in our platform. That's how they deliver this incredible capability. If you've seen some of the architecture and graphics and how I've changed the architecture of and how we talk about the company, it's really about in this one, two, three approach, the apps, the data, and the agents but it's all AI-centric. You're not going to have to DIY it. It is driving me a little crazy, as you've probably heard like when I meet with these customers, and they think, I need to build my own model. I have to train my own model. I have to retrain. They are spending a lot of money on this craziness. It's not working.\nIt is a disappointment that Microsoft has convinced so many customers and others too, even some of these model companies who are just relegated at this point to being commodities, that they have to be customize the stuff. It's not true. It can be done in a platform approach. It's better, easier, lower cost. This technology, we are proving it and we'll show it. If you talk to these customers who have already deployed it, the OpenTables, the Wileys, the Wyndhams, the RBCs, there's a lot of customers who don't want me to use their names, so I'm cautious. It's just very clear this is going to really dramatically make everything better.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nEVP, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Our last question will come from Brent Thill, Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nI think everyone probably wants to understand why now, what was the decision. Maybe it's just simply 11 great years and ready for the next chapter but I think everyone would love to hear your perspective on your decision.For Brian, when you look at the Americas business, you were running double-digit growth. It went to one of the lowest levels. We've seen our model run 8%. What does it take to get back to double-digit growth? Is it saturation issues? Is it competitive? Give us a sense of what you think is happening in the Americas region.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nBrent, hi. I was not expecting that question but I'm happy to address it. Again, thank you for the very nice comments, Keith, Kash, Kirk. Please know how much I've enjoyed working with all of you. I will certainly be on the next earnings call and possibly the one after that as we do our search.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nYou definitely will.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nCFO, Salesforce\n\nDefinitely. All right. We are not moving that fast on the search. We'll have plenty of time for goodbyes at that point. In terms of my decision, it has been an absolutely extraordinary 11 years. I think a journey of just a journey that anyone would be extraordinarily lucky to have. The last four years have been amazing as CFO. I really came in. I remember doing a listening tour with our shareholders my first couple of months. They told me the top two things on their minds were op margin and dilution.\nI set out to see what we could do on both of those. Nearly four years later, we've raised; we've almost doubled operating margin. It was 17% my first year. We're going to do close to 33% this year. We initiated a buyback program with close to $20 billion put back. This year, we layered in a dividend program. We have dealt with all sorts of other incredible opportunities along the way. I think I managed to pack in about four decades of CFO experiences in four years. This feels like the right time for me. I'm really focused on a very smooth transition of finding the next CFO, making sure to relax and recharge, and looking at new adventures. Thank you for the question. Brian, over to you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nI've had a tough transition from that. Hi, Brent. Thanks for the question. First of all, as you know, Americas is the biggest business we have at Salesforce. Where we've had a ton of success for many, many years, I would not characterize that market as saturated. I would not say the competition is what's holding us back. I think the measured buying environment is really what's impacted the largest business we have. In particular, the transactional business, and SMB business is very large in that market. It's going to feel the measured buying environment is weighted heavily in that market. I would not position it that way that we're saturated at all.\nIn fact, I think when you look at our new technology, the new innovation that's coming, the multi-cloud deals that we're bringing, and a very happy customer base, I think we have a huge opportunity to go turn that business around and get it back to double-digit growth. Big opportunity and we love all the innovation that's coming out of our product and development teams because our customers need it. They're looking for us to guide them into this future. Thanks for the question. Very, very much looking forward to seeing that growth back at double digits in the Americas.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nYeah, Sebastian, now you've heard all these great things about a general counsel becoming CFO. Don't you think there's going to be, you want to put your hat in the ring here?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI think we're going to have some incredible internal talent, external candidates. Really, to get the right person who can really take Salesforce and our entire ecosystem, especially all of our customers across every industry forward.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nVery good. Thank you so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brent. Thanks, everyone, for joining. And we look forward to seeing you and speaking with you over the coming weeks. Thanks, all. Once again, everyone, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. Goodbye."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question during this time, simply press STAR followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question again, press the star one. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks and good afternoon. Thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2025 first quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures, reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP results, and guidance, can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which could change should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect. Actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right.\nHey, thanks so much, Mike. I'm really excited for the call today because there's two things that I've really been looking forward to talking about. First is our incredible financial transformation and as you can see from the numbers today. And the second is the incredible work that's happening with artificial intelligence. Look, first of all, in Q1 we delivered $9.13 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. Subscription support revenue grew at 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. And for the 11th year in a row, Salesforce is still ranked the number one provider worldwide by market share based on the latest IDC software tracker. I mean, that really gets to a core part of our technology transformation that I'm going to get to, which is the transformation to AI.\nBecause we are the number one CRM provider, we're now managing more than 250 petabytes of data for our customers. This is going to be absolutely critical as they move into artificial intelligence. Now also let's turn to our financial guidance for fiscal year 2025. We're maintaining our revenue guidance at $37.7 billion-$38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. We now expect fiscal year 2025 subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year-over-year in constant currency. As you can see from our results, we remain committed to profitable growth at scale, and I would also say incredible cash flow, and continue to expect fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, a 200 basis points improvement year-over-year.\nI'm extremely proud of our team's focus and determination to deliver this world class financial result, including this cash flow and profitability in the quarter. Brian and Amy will discuss Q1 performance in much greater detail. As I said, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for Salesforce, not only with these incredible financial results, but in the incredible transformations that we're leading with our customers in artificial intelligence. Every company in the world, across every industry, is being transformed by AI in the next few years. When you look at the power of AI, you realize the models and the UI are not the critical success factors. It's not critical where the enterprise will transform. There are thousands of these models, some open source and some closed source models. Some built with billions, some with just a few dollars. Most of these will not survive.\nThey're just commodities now and it's not where the intelligence lies. They don't know anything about a company's customer relationships. Each day hundreds of petabytes of data are created that AI models can use for training and generating output. But the one thing that every enterprise needs to make AI work is their customer data as well as the metadata that describes the data, which provides the attributes and context the AI models need to generate accurate, relevant output. Customer data and metadata are the new gold for these enterprises. Salesforce now manages, as I mentioned, 250 petabytes of this precious material. We have one of the most and largest repositories of front office enterprise data and metadata in the world. Every day more companies are adopting Salesforce as their front office, bringing all their structured and unstructured data into our platform.\nNearly half of our top 50 wins in the quarter included six or more of our clouds. That really speaks to the comprehensive nature of our strategy. It's incredible. Many of these customers have essential business and customer data that exists outside of Salesforce. That's trapped in thousands of apps and silos. It's disconnected. That's why we're seeing this incredible momentum with our Data Cloud, our fastest growing organic and our next billion dollar cloud. It's the first step to becoming an AI enterprise. Data Cloud gives every company a single source of truth, and you can securely power AI insights and actions across the entire Customer 360. Now let me tell you why I'm excited about Data Cloud and why it's transforming our customers and how it's preparing them for this next generation of artificial intelligence.\nData Cloud was included in 25% of our $1 million-plus deals in the quarter. We added more than 1,000 Data Cloud customers for the second quarter in a row. 8 trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud in the quarter, up 42% year-over-year, and we processed 2 quadrillion records. That's a 217% increase compared to last year. Over 1 trillion activations drove customer engagement, which is a 33% increase year-over-year. This incredible growth of data in our system and the level of transactions that we're able to deliver, not just in the core system, but especially in Data Cloud, is preparing our customers for this next generation of AI.\nLast month we created a Zero Copy Partner Network with partners including Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Snowflake so customers can access this live data from anywhere in Data Cloud without copying or moving it. It's the engine of our future growth and this is the engine of our future artificial intelligence growth as well. As you know, for years we've delivered predictive AI across all our clouds with Einstein. Einstein is generating hundreds of billions of predictions per day, trillions per week. Now we're working with thousands of customers to power generative AI use cases with our Einstein Copilot, our Prompt Builder, our Einstein Studio, all of which went live in Q1. And we've closed hundreds of Copilot deals since this incredible technology has gone GA. And in just the last few months, we're seeing Einstein Copilot develop higher levels of capability.\nWe are absolutely delighted and could not be more excited about the success that we're seeing with our customers with this great new capability. Saks, a leader in the luxury fashion market, part of Hudson's Bay, went all in on Salesforce in the quarter. CEO Marc Metrick is using AI to create more personal experiences for every customer touch point across their company. With our Einstein 1 Platform and Data Cloud, Saks can unify and activate all its customer data to power trusted AI. Another great story is FedEx, a company that we all know, bringing together previously siloed information. It's the leader in getting packages delivered quickly. Of course, how are we going to now deliver a more productive, more efficient, and more profitable FedEx? The Salesforce data and app and AI capabilities generate expense savings.\nThis is the core efficiency of while growing and accelerating top-line revenue. This is the effectiveness that we're delivering for FedEx. This efficiency includes next best action for sellers, automated lead nurturing, Slack for workflow management, opportunity scoring, a virtual assistant, AI on unstructured data for delivering content to sales and customer service. When we think about effectiveness, we see our Journey Builder delivering hyper-personalization, integrating customer experiences across service, sales, and marketing, the ability to tailor and deliver customer experiences based on a Customer 360 view. When we look at this incredible next generation of capability we've delivered at FedEx. Gone now are these days of static business rules that leave customers dissatisfied asking, you know, do they not know that I'm a valued customer of FedEx?\nNow, FedEx has not only the power of the Customer 360 but the power of AI to unlock so much more commercial potential by conducting an orchestra of commercial functions that never played well together before. You have a significant opportunity now with Salesforce and this incredible platform that sellers can convince companies to transform all of their incredible capabilities to deliver another level of profitability. I think stories like that are driving our company forward, and it's all driven by the power of artificial intelligence. Another story I'm really excited about in the quarter is Air India transform with data and AI. If you don't know about Air India, they're an incredible airline who's acquired multiple airlines to create this amazing platform for India's growth. With Data Cloud, Air India is unifying Data Cloud across loyalty, reservations, flight systems, and data warehouses.\nThey have a single source of truth to handle more than 550,000 service cases each month. Now with Einstein, we're automatically classifying and summarizing cases and sending that to the right agent with recommended next steps and upgrading in high value passenger experiences. Even when things happen like a flight delay, our system is able to immediately intervene and provide the right capability to the right customer at the right time. All of that frees up agents to deliver more personal service and create more personal relationships. A more profitable, a more productive, a more efficient Air India, a company that's using AI to completely transform their capability. Well, we're looking forward to talk to you more in this call about these incredible transformations, the financial transformation that we've gone through with these incredible cash flow and margin numbers, and this incredible artificial intelligence transformation.\nNow over to Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nHey, thanks, Marc, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank the team for their hard work this quarter. As Marc said, we're incredibly well positioned for this AI transformation with our number one AI CRM innovating at a pace I have not seen in my entire career. I could not be more excited about the opportunity ahead. We're seeing good demand as AI technology rapidly evolves and customers recognize the value of transforming into AI enterprises. CEOs and CIOs are excited about the opportunity with data and AI and how it can impact their front office operations. We continue to focus on our growth levers of multi cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, the Salesforce ecosystem, and, of course, the data and AI innovations across all of our clouds. Now let me briefly address the buying environment.\nWe continue to see the measured buying behavior similar to what we experienced over the past two years, and with the exception of Q4 where we saw stronger bookings, the momentum we saw in Q4 moderated in Q1, and we saw elongated deal cycles, deal compression, and high levels of budget scrutiny. In addition, in Q1 as part of our ongoing transformation, we made some intentional changes in our go-to-market organization to drive long-term productivity and create better customer experiences, which also played a role in the softer bookings performance. At the same time, we are seeing strong momentum in various parts of our business, particularly data, cloud, and industries, and we continue to drive our core growth levers.\nMulti-cloud deals again were a highlight for us in the quarter with six of our top 10 deals, including six or more clouds, showing the depth and relevance of our portfolio. Let me give you just one example of a company that is using Salesforce across the entire front office. CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity company and a longtime Salesforce customer, added Data Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Revenue Cloud, and MuleSoft in the quarter. CrowdStrike already relied on Einstein 1, sales and service, and Slack, and now they'll use Data Cloud to pull together new and unstructured data from data lakes to build a 360-degree view of their customers, helping them align sales and marketing efforts to drive growth. They're also leveraging MuleSoft with incredible results. MuleSoft has helped CrowdStrike accelerate project delivery by 30% and decrease maintenance costs by 20%.\nSalesforce is now the backbone of CrowdStrike, driving every aspect of CrowdStrike's operation and limiting their reliance on complex siloed third-party applications. As Marc said, we're seeing impressive growth in our Data Cloud business in the quarter. 25% of our deals over $1 million included Data Cloud. It's obviously an important growth lever for us as it brings all of our clouds to life and makes them all better, and we continue to see momentum in Einstein AI with wins at Turtle Bay Resort, Autodesk, and Langley Federal Credit Union as companies transform into AI enterprises. One example is Siemens. Siemens lacked a centralized destination for customers to easily choose the right products and buy on demand.\nTo simplify the buying experience for customers, Siemens worked with Salesforce to develop and launch its Xcelerator Marketplace, an AI-powered digital marketplace built on Einstein 1 Commerce, providing AI-generated product pages, smart recommendations, and self-service ordering. They did it all in just six months.\nObviously AI is not just for our customers. As part of our own transformation, we continue to adopt AI inside Salesforce. Under the leadership of our Chief People Officer Natalie Scardino and our Chief Information Officer Juan Perez, we've integrated Einstein right into Slack, helping our employees schedule, plan, and summarize meetings and answer employee questions. Einstein has already answered nearly 370,000 employee queries in a single quarter, and our engineering organization, our developers, now save more than 20,000 hours of coding each month through the use of our AI tools. These innovations are helping us drive continued efficiencies across the business and accelerated our product roadmaps. We have great momentum with Slack, which again was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We also launched Slack AI in February, an amazing innovation that provides recap, summaries, and personalized search right within Slack.\nI've personally been using it every day to get caught up on the conversations happening in every channel, and we've seen great traction with our customers with this product. Our customers have summarized over 28 million Slack messages since its launch in February.\nRocket Mortgage added Slack AI in the quarter to help its employees save time and close loans faster. They’ve also leveraged external Slack channels to collaborate with partners more effectively and efficiently, and they’ve experienced a 60% faster turnaround speed from working with their customers and partners in Slack. On the international front, we had a solid quarter in LATAM. We had great wins at Celio and Grupo DPSP, and EMEA; great wins at IHG Hotels & Resorts and John Lewis Partnership; and in APAC, Atlassian and Bank of the Philippine Islands were wins in the quarter. We saw particular strength in our Japan business with wins at Seibu Prince Hotels Worldwide, and Hitachi was another growth lever for us in the quarter. Half of our top 10 deals included one of our industry clouds. A great example in the quarter was Paychex, a digital HR leader.\nBy leveraging Financial Services Cloud and Data Cloud, Paychex is able to unify their data, delivering better insights and creating a single view of each customer. Using Einstein 1 Sales and Service, Paychex will be able to proactively manage insurance renewals, which means agents can proactively reach out and surface renewal opportunities during any touch point with the customer 30, 60, or 90 days in advance, driving an increased rate of renewals. In the public sector, the City of Los Angeles chose Salesforce to modernize how the city's 4 million residents request city services using its MyLA311 system. The city will use Government Cloud and other Salesforce solutions to integrate AI assistance into MyLA311 and modernize its own constituent-facing services, giving residents more self-service options and improving service reliability and responsiveness.\nOur partner ecosystem also continues to be a growth lever for us. I'm especially excited about our deep partnership with Amazon as a growth driver for as we move forward into Q2 and beyond. With Salesforce products now available on the AWS Marketplace, joint customers are able to expedite their deployments through faster buying and billing experiences and flexible budgeting options. In closing, I want to echo Marc acknowledging the hard work of the team. Our continued success has been made possible by our amazing employees, customers, partners, and trailblazers and with that I will now pass it off to Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks Brian. Q1 represents another quarter of continued discipline and transformation across the business. I am very proud of all of our employees for their continued dedication and hard work. Now let's go straight to the Results. For the first quarter, revenue was $9.13 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. The result was at the lower end of our guided range due to continuing pressures on professional services, some license revenue volatility, and the continued measured buying environment.\nSubscription and Support revenue grew 12% year-over-year in nominal and 13% in constant currency. As mentioned on our last call, this included a tailwind from the timing of license revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau related to Q4 deals and a one point benefit from the leap year. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, Americas revenue grew 11%, EMEA grew 10% or 9% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14% or 21% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in Japan, India, and Canada, while the U.S. parts of LATAM and EMEA were constrained from an industry perspective. In Q1, public sector and financial services both performed well while high tech and retail and consumer goods were more constrained. Our new offerings for small and medium businesses, Starter and Pro Suite, which are ready to use simplified solutions with AI built in, are building momentum in Q1.\nWe added another 2,300 new logos to these products. Since Starter's launch last year, we've seen customers upgrade to our recently launched Pro Suite and even to our Enterprise and Unlimited editions.\nQ1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at around 8%, in line with recent quarters. I'm also very pleased that our non-GAAP operating margin again finished strong at 32.1%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, and our profitable growth trajectory continues to drive strong cash flow generation. Q1 operating cash flow was $6.25 billion, up 39% year-over-year. Q1 free cash flow was $6.1 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Cash flow did benefit modestly from the timing of cash tax payments. Now to put this cash flow performance in context, we have more than tripled the cash we generated just four years ago.\nTurning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, we ended Q1 at $53.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or cRPO, ended at $26.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year in nominal. Now this includes a $200 million FX headwind which results in more than 10% year-over-year growth in constant currency. cRPO growth was primarily driven by resilience in our core products. However, as Brian mentioned, we did continue to experience measured buying behavior which is reflected in the moderated Q1 bookings.\nOn capital return. We were incredibly proud to pay out our first ever quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share for a total of $388 million. And altogether in Q1 we returned more than $2.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This brings our total cash returned since the inception of our capital return programs to more than $14 billion. We remain committed to continued capital return and anticipate declaring our quarterly dividend next month, subject to board approval. Now let's turn to guidance starting with full fiscal year 2025. A few items to note. First on the buying environment. We are assuming that the conditions we saw in Q1 continue throughout our fiscal year on FX. Our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year or about a 30 basis points impact.\nWe also continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue with deal compression, and customers delaying or slowing projects. However, we also continue to see strong demand for Data Cloud and multi cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from recent pricing and packaging changes, and we're seeing strong industry adoption. These factors are also included in our guide. As a result, on revenue we are maintaining our guidance range of between $37.7 and 38 billion, growth of 8%-9% year-over-year. We now expect subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year-over-year in constant currency, and we expect attrition to remain generally consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. As a reminder, starting in fiscal 2025 we include Slack in our metric, which we expect to create a modest headwind.\nNow turning to profitability and cash flow on margins, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5% representing a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year following the significant increase last year. This incorporates intentional investment and targeted growth opportunities, notably AI data and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is now expected to be just above 8% as a percent of revenue. The modest increase from our prior guidance is primarily a result of lower voluntary employee attrition in Q1 than in recent years. As a result, for fiscal year 2025 GAAP operating margin guidance is expected to be approximately 20% representing 550 basis points of improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year 2025 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.04-$6.12.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.86-$9.94 as a result of our continued margin expansion. We are delivering world class cash flow, and we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 21%-24%, inclusive of cash tax payment headwinds. We also continue to expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23%-26% for the fiscal year. Now, to guidance for Q2 on revenue, we expect $9.2 billion-$9.25 billion, up 7%-8% year-over-year in nominal and approximately 8% in constant currency. CRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be 9% year-over-year in nominal, including a $200 million FX headwind, resulting in 10% constant currency growth. This includes ongoing headwinds from professional services.\nFor Q2, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.31-$1.33 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.34-$2.36.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that I am incredibly proud of the company's commitment to disciplined strategic investments and continued productivity gains to drive strong margin expansion and cash flow growth, etc. Of course, I want to thank our employees and our shareholders for their continued support. Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy, and thanks everyone for joining. When we go to Q&A, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question, and with that, Rob will take the first question.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and I appreciate all the detail on sort of the growth drivers and what you guys are excited about in the business. But the quarter did come in below your expectations for cRPO growth, and we all look at that as a forward indicator. But you're not taking down the full year revenue guidance. So I was hoping you could help us get comfortable on why that's not leaving risk on the table and why you guys feel comfortable that original fiscal year 2025 guide is still appropriate. Why not take it down, make it more conservative, and ensure that we can get back to beat and raise quarters on a go forward basis.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat, Keith, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. Let me start by saying that there are many factors we have to consider within our guidance, and all in, based on what we're seeing at this time, we continue to believe that we will be within the range we guided. Now, any guide that is a balancing act, and as Brian called out, we are continuing to see this measured buying behavior. It's really been very consistent for the last two full years at this point, with the possible exception of Q4, where we did see stronger bookings, and you can see the impact of that environment on our Q1 numbers. There's no question about that. Proserve also continues to see more and more pressure as customers are really just looking for shorter duration projects.\nHowever, this is really balanced by the demand that we are seeing in our products and that remains strong. We continue to see good demand on multi cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from pricing and packaging changes that we have rolled out over the past year. We're seeing very healthy adoption around our industry's projects. I also should point out that our attrition remains, our attrition rate remains very healthy. Customers are continuing to rely on Salesforce to run their businesses and they'll continue to do that. So when I step back and really take a holistic view of the full year, we do feel confident that we will be within our guiding range.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI'd like to add, I really continue to focus on exactly, like Amy says, this incredible transformation that we've seen with the financials. Obviously, you know, we're delivering some quarter, some numbers this quarter that were beyond our imagination just a few quarters ago. But another point of optimism is not just what Amy said, but also, you know, we see this incredible transformation happening with our customers. And we all know the AI transformation is many transformations. It's a transformation of how we're interacting with software. It's also a transformation of these algorithms, or we call these models that the AI is built on. And it's a transformation of the data that's used by, whether it's consumers or enterprises, to deliver this incredible next level of intelligence.\nBut for enterprises, we know that this customer data and this metadata is really the new gold for these enterprises, and it's a huge driver of growth for our business. We all saw the report from McKinsey. 75% of the value of Gen AI use cases is in the front office. And everybody knows Salesforce is the leader in front office software. That's our fundamental premise for our growth going forward. That we're already managing 250 petabytes of data and metadata that's going to be used to generate this incredible level of intelligence and artificial capability to deliver for our customers a level of productivity and profitability they've just never been able to see before. And at the heart of that is going to be our Data Cloud.\nAnd we've seen this Data Cloud, well, we've seen this deliver for our customers an incredible level of capability in just a short period that we've made it available. It's already included in 25% of our million-dollar-plus deals, as I mentioned, and more than 1,000 Data Cloud customers in the second quarter. Again, that's our second quarter in a row. You know, when we look at a quarter where we see huge growth of a new product, it really sets us up, you know, for continued delivery of growth of that incredible technology. But what's the cool thing about Data Cloud is it's connected to every single one of our clouds. So it's making our Sales Cloud better, our Service Cloud better, our Marketing Cloud, our Commerce Cloud. Every aspect of Salesforce is better now with this incredible new technology.\nAnother key part of it is, as I mentioned, eight trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud in the first quarter. That was up 42% year-over-year. And two quadrillion records were processed. That's up 217% year-over-year in over a trillion activations driving customer engagement up 33% year-over-year. All of that means that we're preparing our customers for a level of data capability that's going to give them this next capability of artificial intelligence. And last month we created the Zero Copy Partner Network with Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Snowflake that federates our Data Cloud with all these amazing data sources. Look, we really are focused on two things in our company. One is this incredible financial transformation that we've all gone through with you in the last year.\nThe second one is this incredible transformation to artificial intelligence, which is going to be based on data. I don't think any company is more well positioned for the future of artificial intelligence and also delivering the kind of metrics that our stakeholders are going to want in Salesforce.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Rob, we'll take the next question please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOh great. Thank you so much. I appreciate the commentary on the impact from the tough macro. We're certainly seeing that across the group. Brian, you mentioned also perhaps some impact here from go to market changes, which I guess shouldn't be a big surprise given all that's going on at Salesforce right now. I wonder if you could just articulate a little bit on that. What are those changes? Is this the kind of situation where it's just some short-term impact that could benefit the sales productivity over the longer-term? Thank you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Brad. Hey, thanks for the question. You're exactly right. These are changes that we typically make in the first quarter. It's the most obvious time to make those changes when you start out a new year. These changes are actually intended to be productivity drivers for the future. Absolutely right. We want to get aligned behind our go to market strategy around buyer to make sure that we're aligned to support our customer scale, that we can really support our multi cloud strategy going forward to ensure our customers know exactly what we can do to support them across our entire product portfolio. Some of the changes that we made were exactly for that reason. How do we ensure that we are aligned behind that strategy to ensure we can go faster.\nIn Q2, Q3, and Q4? So you're absolutely right. The changes, while impactful in Q1, are short-term and we expect to see productivity gains from them going forward.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad. Rob, we'll take the next question, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Just from a geographic perspective, Europe looked like it was a little weaker. I'm curious if that's where you saw pronounced weakness in EMEA or was this pretty consistent across most of the geographic regions? Thank you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYes, EMEA was weaker in the quarter, frankly, feeling some of the measured buying environment. Most pronouncedly, actually felt it also in the Americas, but there were other pockets around the world that were very strong. Canada was a strong region for us in the quarter. I mentioned our Japan business really accelerated in the quarter. Really outstanding performance from our Japan business. So the big businesses are going to feel the impact, obviously, of the measured buying environment in the Americas. More exposure to technology, which I think we all know has been a tough industry over the last several quarters. SMB and other areas, the transactional business, these are the areas we're going to feel some of those headwinds in the business. So spot on. EMEA and Americas are sort of feeling the impacts of the measured environments.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Rob, we'll take the next question, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much.\nMaybe for Marc or Brian, but I.\nWas just kind of curious, when we think about this measured buying environment, is there any sort of crowding effect around AI that's impacting software in your view?\nMeaning when you think about all these companies starting to gear up for this.\nNext platform shift, it was just the.\nUncertainty of what they're going to spend.\nOver the next six to 12.\nMonths holding them back, perhaps, on what their normal sort of pace of spending might be with you all or other enterprise software companies. I know it's sort of an ongoing question, wondering if you all could weigh in. Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, let me give you my swing at exactly where we are, and then I'm going to turn it over to Brian to fill in the detail. You know, I think when you look back over the last four years, you know, Salesforce entered the pandemic in 2020, four years ago, almost exact, you know, about half the size that we're at now. We've doubled our company at scale. You know, to $20 billion. From $20 billion to approximately $40 billion. That's how I look at it in my mind. You know, you can fill in the exact numbers. And over that period of time, we saw an incredible surge in the demand and buying environment and in the sales environment, especially during the pandemic.\nAs we entered the post-pandemic reality, we saw companies who had acquired so much software in that time look to actually rationalize it, ingest it, integrate it, install it, update it. I mean, it's just a massive amount of software that was put in. And so for every enterprise software company kind of has adjusted turning into this post-pandemic environment. So when you look at all of these companies, especially as you saw them report in the last 30 days, they're all basically saying that same thing in different ways. When you take AI, that has to be your growth driver for future capabilities for these companies.\nAI, when we look at these companies and the stories that we told, you know, on the call, whether it's FedEx, Air India, CrowdStrike, or Paychex or any of the huge deals that we did in the quarter, you know, what we're seeing is not only the installation, integration, and implementation of the platforms that we've sold in the last four years, but the layering in of this new capability which is delivering for these companies, you know, a kind of a capability that we weren't able to forecast four years ago.\nWhen we saw, like I told you the story of FedEx, like when we talk to their top executives about what they've delivered, or you take an incredible company like State Farm who's kind of automated 60 million policyholders, you know, and thousands of agents, they're just able to deliver, you know, at a level of capability, and I said it before, but profitability, employee augmentation, better customer relationships, much higher margins. These are financial metrics that we're able to deliver into these implementations, that's on top of where we were four years ago. I think that, as in the point I was trying to make here earlier in I'll keep making, which is the most important thing Salesforce is doing, is not just continuing to automate every customer touchpoint. This is obviously critical and why we've been able to consume this 250 petabytes of information.\nBut the second key point is we've rebuilt the way that we are delivering a foundation of data for our customers. Why is that so important? Because as we have now rearchitected all of our apps and all of our capabilities, the fuel and the foundation is this Data Cloud. It means that for our customers going forward, they're going to be able to take this Data Cloud and leverage that into their future capability, and growth, and especially profitability, and productivity. And that is where our whole company, and I think our whole industry, is eventually going to go. Not every company is as well positioned as, you know, Salesforce is for this artificial intelligence capability because they just don't have the data. They may say they have this capability or that capability, this user interface, that model, that, whatever.\nAll of these things are quite fungible and are expiring quickly as the technology rapidly moves forward. But the piece that will not expire is the data. The data is the permanent key aspect. It's, as we said in our, even in our core marketing, you know, it's the gold for our customers in their ability to deliver a next capability in their own enterprises. And Brian, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, thanks, Marc and I. All those things, absolutely true. Marc said earlier 75% of Gen AI benefits will come from the front office. We're really feeling that right now in our demand. We're seeing from our customers and the pipelines that we're creating out there solid performance on pipegen. I do think customers are getting their data estate in order is a precursor to leveraging AI capabilities. We're seeing that with the growth of Data Cloud right now. Customers really wanting to bring together many data sources so they can leverage AI in the flow of work and our capabilities. So I think it's actually a step process for many of our customers. Let's get our data in order and then let's layer in the AI to really drive the productivity gains that we expect.\nSo that's really what we're seeing in the market right now. Kirk.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kirk. Rob, let's go to the next question, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nSoftware Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll switch subjects. Marc and Amy, there was some concern in your shareholder base in March and April around media reports related to M&A. I know you can't comment on those reports. Not expecting that, but wondering if you could comment on your M&A framework. Whether there's been any change to it at all, I think might be helpful. Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, no, I'd love to talk about that. I think it's extremely important. I mean, Salesforce has a long history of innovation, organic innovation like we've seen today with Data Cloud. Everyone, I'm sure, is extremely impressed with the growth of that product. But also inorganic innovation and a lot of our customer touch points, whether it's our commerce platform or our marketing platform, and their integration platform, our inorganic innovation, you know, products that we acquired, many of them at the multi-hundred-million-dollar revenue level, that are at the multi-billion-dollar revenue level. Some of the largest, most important software companies in the market today are actually companies that we acquired at much smaller levels. All of you know Salesforce's story and how we put all of that together.\nAnd of course, I've mentioned we're rearchitecting almost every single one of those products, and quite successfully, and deploying and redeploying them to our customers into a single integrated data fabric to provide the power of future artificial intelligence. Now when we look at all of that combined, we always are looking at what is the next level of innovation. And so we're going to be looking at products organically. But yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically. But as we've committed to you, if we're looking at a large-scale acquisition, we're going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that it's accretive, you know, that it is, you know, has the right metrics.\nWe're also going to be quick to walk away from things that we are not totally confident in or that we don't have the trust with whatever company that we're looking at. We have operated inside that framework. We continue to acquire companies. We just acquired amazing new company called Spiff, which is part of our Salesforce automation platform. It's an amazing capability. I mean Salesforce, as you know, is the number one SFA platform in the world. That SFA platform got a lot better this quarter with the capabilities now that it's deeply integrated into Data Cloud, which gives SFA customers the next step of growth with our SFA platform. But also it has an incredible new level of artificial intelligence and generative AI capabilities now built into the Sales Cloud.\nIn addition, it also has compensation capabilities through Spiff, and that's through inorganic, and that was acquired through our new M&A framework, for example. As we go forward, we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. Look, we're not going to shy away from M&A for any one particular reason if it's within our framework, but if it's outside of our framework, we're going to be extremely cautious. Let me have Amy reiterate what the attributes of that framework are and how we look at M&A, because I don't think any company has been more successful with M&A than Salesforce has been. I mean, that's how we've built our Customer 360 and have this incredible, incredible platform that we're able to automate these amazing companies with that we've gone through.\nBut as we go forward, we know that we need to slightly adjust that so that we can continue to deliver to you these amazing financial metrics that you see. Like you see this amazing cash flow number and margin number that we've seen rarely before in the software industry. Maybe only a couple companies have ever delivered cash flow at this level. And I think it's higher than most of the great consumer companies like Coke, Starbucks, and all of that. These numbers are pretty epic in that area. But we know to deliver, continue to deliver cash flow and margin numbers at this level, we're also going to have to continue to keep our eye on the M&A framework. So, Amy, let's talk about that.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat, thanks Marc. Let me back it up a little bit to talk about our capital allocation strategy overall. It's really very simple. We are going to continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We are going to invest in innovation. As Marc said, that is organic, and it can be inorganic if it matches our principles and our goals. We are going to return cash to shareholders. We are doing that now, both through our share repurchase program and our dividends program. Now, on the inorganic perspective, as you brought up, we're always going to be opportunistic. You know, M&A has been an incredible part of our past. I'm sure at the right time it will be part of our future. But it's got to fit into the framework that we have been outlining for the last few days.\nWe're going to have to have a clear timeline to value accretion. We're going to need to prioritize our use of the balance sheet, and it's got to be a best-in-class asset. When all that comes together, that's what we'll be focused on. In the meantime, you know, I really want to talk about our goal. We are trying to optimize shareholder value. At the end of the day, that's the single most important element. We're doing that by focusing on delivering very strong free cash flow per share. We're doing this by our focus on profitable growth and by very carefully managing our dilution. When you bring that together, I am very confident in our long-term free cash flow per share opportunity. I'm very confident about our capital allocation strategy overall.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Karl.\nRob, we'll take the next question, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, thank you.\nObviously, this quarter was impacted on the booking side. Maybe a question for Brian and Amy here. If you think about the two factors you pointed out, one is the economy, one is the sales changes at the beginning of the year.\nOn the economy side, like we've been talking about a tough selling environment for a while now. Has it gotten worse from what you've seen, or are the issues this quarter more coming from the CL3? Thank you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nRaimo. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Hard to parse apart what the two impacts were in our first quarter. No doubt about it, we did have some changes that I outlined in the quarter as we set ourselves up for productivity and FY2025. The economy question, I think, is one that we feel like it's similar to what we felt in the first half of last year. The same measured buying environments that we experienced in the first half is sort of what felt like the same in Q1. We came off a Q4 that was very solid, very, very strong performance. In retrospect and hindsight, we may have been in a similar environment, but executed very well as a sales team in that fourth quarter. So hard to really parse apart these things.\nBut when you look at some of the transactions that we saw in Q1, we saw compression on many deals that we ultimately ended up getting done, but they got smaller when we ultimately closed them. We saw a couple deals push out of the quarter as people delayed decisions that we thought would actually happen in our first quarter. And, you know, there's no decision issue coming up more frequently than we anticipated. So it's hard to really parse those two things apart. But when you combine them both in a particular quarter, it can have an impact of lower bookings. And that's what we felt in our first quarter.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Yeah, I think I'd also like to add, and I'll just give you a little color on the narrative inside our company when we look at operating inside this environment, which, you know, we've been now going through for a couple of years, and we look at, hey, how do we continue to deliver these strong ACV numbers, but also how do we continue to deliver the overall strong financial metrics? At the same time, it's important that we're delivering this high level of customer success to prepare for our future growth. It's really along three lines. And those three lines, first of all is we're just having to start every quarter with much higher pipelines. We look at these pipeline multiples as much higher than we've traditionally had to start with. And this is really critical in managing our distribution organization and overall success in the quarter.\nWhere traditionally we might have to start our pipelines at 2x. Now our message to our distribution leaders is, hey, if you're going to start out your pipeline in the quarter, you better start out at 3x. This is also our message to our peers as well. Evaluate the pipeline much more aggressively than ever before. That means a much deeper inspection of the pipeline, but holding it at a much higher level. That is evidence of this environment. If you would ask any leader in this company how many times they've heard from me or from Brian that they better start at a 3x pipeline, because that is the world that we're in today. The second attribute that's incredibly important for all of our leaders and, you know, in our company or throughout our industry is you might need a much higher level of enablement.\nWhat that means is so many people have come into our industry in the last five or even 10 years. A lot of them just need the level of training, capability, especially as we move into this new area of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, generative AI, data, you know, the kind of capabilities that we're talking about. When we explain to people how models work, how UIs work, how data frameworks work, and how it works in regards to our software and our platforms and our architectures, that is requiring a level of training that is incredibly important. And when we're talking about companies at scale like Salesforce, who have very significant numbers of salespeople, I'm not going to go into all the details of how it's organized and how many we have, but just know that that requires a very high level enablement.\nThat's the second key attribute, managing in this framework, in this environment. And the third is a level of stability. Now, when you enter the first quarter of any fiscal year, there always is going to be a desire of every sales organization to slightly shift, slightly adjust their strategy and their organization to reflect the demands of the fiscal year. You start the fiscal year writing your business plan, thinking about how you're going to execute. And then you have to look at how much disruption are you able to tolerate in the quarter because if you over shift, if you do too much, you will end up with more volatility in the quarter, in the ACV than you like. Now, it may result in a better fourth quarter.\nA good example is last year, you know, where we saw looking in the first quarter, we might not have achieved exactly everything we wanted because we had too much disruption, but by the fourth quarter we overdelivered. So there is a level of balance that has to be achieved in regards to stability and disruption. And those four attributes, having 3x pipelines, having much higher levels of enablement, and having much higher levels of stability, that is the key to managing in this environment, in this part of the industry right now. And when I talk to my peers and other major enterprise software companies, that is what I'm really emphasizing to them.\nFor all of them, of course, it's good if they're using our products because our products are really the key to making all of that happen, because we're able to deliver for these companies all of those things that they need to have that level of success as well.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Raimo. Rob, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much, Marc and team. Actually looking at the Salesforce Tower from my office here, and I'm thinking about the past. And Marc, you've been through all these cycles before. Maybe it's just cyclical, maybe high interest rates causing economic uncertainty, maybe it's as simple as that, or maybe it's structural.\nIf it's structural, maybe there's an architectural change going on. Marc, you drove the last big architectural change from distributed computing to Internet computing. How confident you are that this generative AI, which is causing an upheaval in that whole tech stack, is not something to take lightly. What are the things that the company is preparing if it's not just cyclical? Maybe there's structural change that's going on. What are the things that you are doing to the company to bulletproof? Because typically, people, incumbents miss big transitions, right? You and I have seen that. We've all seen that. What are the things you're doing to ensure that you're bulletproof in that regard, that you're absolutely ready architecturally for the next cycle?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell.\nI will just say, I like to make a couple comments on that. I think that, number one, it's been pretty magical to use OpenAI over the last year, especially in the last release, you know, where I'm really talking to it. When I think about the incredible engineering effort that OpenAI has done, it's pretty awesome. They built a great UI. You know, I love talking to the software.\nThey have really strong algorithms or what we call models, especially their new one, which is their 4o model. And then, you know, they stole data from lots of companies like Time, Dow Jones, New York Times, and Reddit. Now they're all making good, you know, doing agreements with all of us saying we're sorry and paying for it. And they took that data, they normalized it, they delivered a comprehensive data set that then they trained their model on. And all of us understand that that's what they did, right? They have a great UI, they have this amazing model, and then they have the data. And then we've seen a lot of fast followers with the models. You know, it could be open source models like Llama 3, it could be some proprietary models like Gemini from Google, and others. Now there's thousands and thousands of these models.\nIf you look on Hugging Face, you know, everybody's a fast follower. Six months later, everybody is where everybody else was six months ago. The data, well, a lot of these companies are all thinking they can rip off all this data too, and they're all having to pay that price. Okay, that's the consumer world. The enterprise world's a little different, right? We have great user interfaces, great apps, all kinds of great technology that our users are using, the millions and millions of users. Then we have.\nThe same models in many cases, or maybe we've written some of our own models with our engineers. But then the third piece is the data, and that data is a little bit different because in the enterprise, how do you put together these large, fully normalized data sets to deliver this incredible capability? And that is where the magic is going to be. Because for all companies, including ours, others who want to deploy generative AI internally, it's not just going to be Time magazine that's going to give you the intelligence; it's going to be your customer data, your transaction history, and how your, how your company operates in your workflow and your metadata. And that idea that we can deliver another level of productivity for companies using that architecture is absolutely in front of us.\nBut that idea that we have to do it with the right architecture that also is in front of us. I think that while we can say it's a different kind of architecture, it's still the same idea that we need a great UI, we need models, but we're going to need very highly normalized and federated data. And that data needs to be stored somewhere, and it needs to come from somewhere, and it's going to, that is, going to be something that's going to continue in perpetuity over time as these models and UIs, you know, are quite fungible. And, you know, we'll be using different models and different UIs over the years, but we'll be using the same deep data sources. I think that is why, when I look at what Salesforce is doing, this is going to be critical for our customers.\nNow, you may see great new UIs like agents, and you may see great new UIs like, you see what we've deployed with Slack. You know, Brian was talking about how he's, you know, changed how he uses Slack with our new Slack AI, or what we've done with SFA this quarter, service this quarter with the incredible new generative capabilities. But this idea that the data is going to be more important for companies than ever, having deeply normalized federated data sources. When I look at the success we've had with so many of these companies, I mentioned State Farm briefly. We've become their fundamental data architecture. That is not where we were with that company even four years ago. Now they look at us as the fundamental framework for their future.\nAs they want to deploy agents or as they want to deploy new user interfaces or achieve more productivity, the data that they have in Salesforce and the ability to manage and share, keep that data reliable, available, and scalable. The way that we do updates that we don't bring down our system, you know, do an upgrade or update like a lot of vendors still do, you know, those kind of capabilities that will be more important than ever. I think that that is going to be a huge driver for our growth going forward and provide the foundation for this future and what the future of the enterprise is going to look like. I think it's a little bit different than in the consumer model.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kash. Rob, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you very much. Marc, you mentioned that there's a transformation of how we interact with software that's happening. I'm curious if you sense any temporary pause as customers may be trying to digest the new innovations, the new pricing mechanisms. It includes consumption pricing, and that perhaps there's going to be a pause that refreshes down the road as they'll ultimately gain comfort and start to move forward with the Einstein Copilots and all the other innovations that require, you know, a little bit of a different architecture, but a different thought process.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think it's a very key question, which is, you know, Salesforce is managing many different kinds of pricing models. Obviously, like our Data Cloud is a consumption product. We've seen, you know, a clear path now to over a billion in revenue with that product. It uses consumption pricing. You know, we look at our core SFA product, which is a product doing, I don't know, approximately $8 billion a year, or Service Cloud doing approximately $8 billion a year. These are per user prices. But when you buy Salesforce now and you're buying our products, you know, you might be buying a new product that we have called UE+ and that's a product that we just introduced a few months ago. Now why is that exciting? Because UE+ is a hybrid pricing model that includes per user pricing and consumption pricing.\nIt delivers for our customers the ability to deploy all the architectures that I articulated on the call today, but to do it at an incredibly competitive price point. When we look at the very large customers that are deploying Salesforce standardizing on our platform to deliver this kind of capability for the future, as we retrain our salespeople to be able to have the narrative that I have on the call today, this idea that we can deliver, basically not only the number one AI CRM, not only deliver, you know, we see these incredible growth in our pipelines, as I mentioned, not only the kind of the next generation, you know, price points and products like with UE+, but we have to deliver it with a level of customer success for our partners and the implementations at scale.\nAnd also, you know, what the culture that, you know, Salesforce is known for, those are really the five elements that we are really taking into consideration as we're moving forward. We think that we have the right mix, and we're spending a lot of time talking to our customers very, very closely. Look, I don't think that there aren't a lot of people walking into these companies saying, hey, you can do this, you can do that, you can do these other things. We've seen a lot of that in the last six to 12 months. And then it turns out that you can't, hey, I can make this happen, I can make that happen. I can pull a rabbit out of the hat in the enterprise for you by doing this, that, and the other thing. And then it doesn't actually happen.\nAnd then what it turns out is you got to do a lot of the hard work to make this AI happen. That starts with building highly normalized, large-scale, federated, highly available data sources and then building on top of that the kind of capabilities to deliver it to our customers. I think a common story is, hey, oh yeah, I am a provider of.\nA data lake or a data capability, and just by going to that, I'm going to be able to provide all your AI. But then it turns out that no one in the enterprise actually uses that product. There is no UI that's commonly accessed. That's why I'm so excited that Salesforce is Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Tableau, Slack, and all of our amazing products that have, you know, these huge numbers of users that use these products every single day in a trusted, scalable way and then connecting that into this new capability; that's where the magic is going to happen by the time we get to Dreamforce.\nFor those of you maybe were at our Connections conference or at our last world tour in New York or even Trailhead DX, you know, we haven't heard gasps in the audience when we've demoed the products in a lot. You know, I think maybe ever. Like some of the new technology is incredible. We're able to deliver for our customers, and I think that it's going to be extremely exciting going forward, and it will be delivered with a variety of new business models and pricing models. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to be, you know, a trusted partner to these customers, delivering this AI at scale.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat.\nWe want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nSa."

With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Hey, thanks so much, Mike. Hey, thanks everyone for being on the call. Look, as you can see from these numbers, we've had just an incredible and incredible quarter, well, actually, we've just had an incredible year here at Salesforce with strong performance across all of our key metrics: revenue, margin, EPS, cash flow, and, of course, our cRPO. Look, it's been an extraordinary year of transformation for Salesforce. You all know that. You've all been there with us. You've been the support that we have needed during this year. Thank you to all of our shareholders, and thank you to all of our stakeholders. It's been a year of incredible transformation for our industry with the emergence of this next generation of artificial intelligences as well. It's been really two unbelievable things happening at once: the total transformation of Salesforce and the total transformation of our industry.\nAll right. Let's start with the transformation of Salesforce. Okay. Look, it was over a year ago. We said Salesforce had to transform. And you, many of you, came to me, came to our whole team, and you said, \"Look, we're going to transform the whole company.\" We did it together. We could not have done it without you. We said we would restructure our business for the short and long term. We did that. We said we would place a laser focus on increasing productivity and operational excellence from across the board. We've done that. We said we were going to double down on innovation to make our core products even better. We've done that. And when you see what's coming to Trailhead DX next week, you're not going to believe it.\nNot just our next-generation artificial intelligence, not just our Prompt Builder, not just our Copilot, but this Data Cloud, which I'm going to get to in a second, our fastest, most exciting new product ever, fastest growing, most customer traction that I have ever seen. That has been incredible. So let's talk about all of this. And let's talk also about how we have also strengthened our relationships with our investors. Thank you, Mike, for everything you've done. And Amy, together with the management team, with our board, we've really focused on you, the investor community. We've accomplished all of that together. We've completely transformed this company together, and we're very grateful to each and every one of you. And that transformation, well, it has driven incredible results. You're seeing productivities up, profitabilities up, margins up, revenues up.\nYou're going to see it again in our results for our quarter. You're going to be looking at these full-year numbers with phenomenal cash flow, with incredible margin growth, well, margin growth that I've never seen in any software company over the last 12 months, 18 months. It's completely unprecedented. You can see the incredible speed and success of the transformation that we've undertaken. Now, we believe that Salesforce not only needs to be a great software company for our customers, our employees, our communities, but also a great company for our shareholders as well. We've certainly seen that with exceptional performance of our equity over the last few months. Now, I'm thrilled that we're opening the door to another incredible part of our ongoing transformation today with the introduction of our first-ever dividend.\nAnd that's amazing to say that word for the first time in 25 years in Salesforce history, our first-ever dividend, which you're going to hear more about from Amy in a moment. And if this year has shown anything, if it's shown anything at all, it really shows that we've committed to serving all of our stakeholders. We closed out fiscal 2024 with $9.29 billion in revenue for the Q4. That's up 11% year-over-year, 10% in constant currency. Pretty awesome. At our size and scale, incredible. Eight of our top 10 deals in the quarter included six or more of our clouds, really showing the depth and breadth of our product line and our portfolio. And all of our top 10 wins included sales, service, and platform, and we're really focused on delivering that full cocktail of all of our clouds to all of our customers.\nAnd our deals greater than $10 million, well, they grew nearly 80% year-over-year in fiscal year 2024. That was also amazing. Our customers just get so much more value, and they can do so much more when they take the full advantage of our Einstein 1 Platform. I want to explain that to you because we have such a rich set of applications that when we're working with all of these employees through the whole company and also the customers as well, we're filling our platform with the data and the metadata that our customers need to be successful. And there is no other time in the history of our industry that that rich data and metadata together in one place is so important because that is what you're going to need to drive this artificial intelligence.\nYou're going to see that next week at Trailhead DX as we show you our Copilot for the first time and Prompt Builder for the first time and Data Cloud for the first time and how it works together so that you can get the insights that you need. Now, this is all possible because we're delivering this Einstein 1 Platform. But before I get to that, I just want to make this one last point. For the full year, we delivered $34.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, one of the best performances of any enterprise software companies ever. With our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 was also 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year.\nWe closed fiscal 2024 with operating cash flow reaching $10.2 billion, operating cash flow up 44% year-over-year, a major goal for the company this year. Well done, highest cash flow in our company's history. cRPO, our current remaining performance obligation was $27.6 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency year-over-year. Fantastic display on cRPO. Total remaining performance obligation ended the Q4 at $56.9 billion and increased to 17% year-over-year. Now, let me just say this again: $57 billion in RPO, amazing. For fiscal 2025, we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26% for fiscal 2025. That is, for fiscal 2025, we expect free cash flow to grow between 23% to 26%. We're guiding revenue to $38 billion at the high end of our range, 9% year-over-year.\nExpecting to deliver fiscal 2025 subscription and support revenue growth of above 10% year-over-year in constant currency. We're going to get to that detail in a second. We're committed to delivering non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%. All told, an unbelievable year of transformation. From the financial metrics, we're going to get to the technology now. Before I move on, let me just say I've never seen anything like it over the last 25 years as CEO of Salesforce. The pace of change, the focus on productivity, profitability, the speed of innovation, the quality of the management team, people coming back to help us get it done, our boomerangs, our Ohana. Thank you to everyone who's made this possible. Just look at where we are now.\nSalesforce is the world's number one AI CRM, number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, number one data cloud. Incredible. And since the start of the pandemic in 2020, we've doubled the size of the company. That's amazing. We doubled the size of the company in scale since the pandemic started, which was about four years ago. That's incredible at our scale. We're the largest enterprise applications company in the world. We passed SAP. That was amazing. That was a huge accomplishment this year. But now, we're the third largest enterprise software company in the world and the second largest in Japan. And to all of my Japan Ohana, domo arigatou gozaimashita, for what you have done with the Japanese market is incredible. We're not stopping.\nOur management team and our extraordinary employees are focused every day to make our business as strong as it can be. Personally, I've never been more excited about the future of Salesforce. You're about to hear why. It's not just the incredible financial results, not just the unrivaled success of our customers, but it is the incredible door that has opened through artificial intelligence once again and the evolution of our entire technology platform. It's what our engineering and product teams have done in the last 12 months is nothing short of amazing. I am so grateful to their leadership and to David and Srini and to all of your employees.\nThank you for what you have done for Salesforce, your leadership, your vision, your insights, your creativity in rebuilding the platform so quickly and Data Cloud for artificial intelligence, for Steve, what you have done, for Jujhar, for my whole team. It's incredible. As I said, it's not only a remarkable year of transformation for Salesforce. It's been an amazing year of transformation for our entire industry. As I talk to CEOs around the world, they tell me they want three things. You may have heard me say this already, but I'll say it again. One, they want more productivity, and they're going to get that productivity through the fundamental augmentation of their employees through artificial intelligence. It's happening. It's empirical. Number two is they want higher-value customer relationships, which is also going to happen through this AI.\nAnd they want higher margins, which we are seeing empirically as well when they use this artificial intelligence in these next-generation products. As we look at productivity, as we look at higher-value customer relationships, as we look at higher margins, how do our customers get these things? How are they achieving these goals? It is AI. It is why every CEO and company knows they need to make major investments in AI right now. And I believe this is the single most important moment in the history of the technology industry. It's giving companies an unprecedented level of intelligence that will allow them to connect with their customers in a whole new way. And with our Einstein 1 platform, we're helping out our customers transform for the AI future. Now, many of our customers have been inspired by OpenAI's GPT-4. I have and Cohere. I have and Anthropic.\nI have an Inflection. I have, and also all the amazing models on Hugging Face and other AI models. All these things. It's amazing. And everyone has been wowed by what these AIs can do. Incredible things and a lot of party tricks, a lot of magical things. And then we also realize there's some other things too. Let's talk about the truth. The truth is that these AI models are all trained on amalgamated public data. You all understand that. You've all seen the New York Times lawsuit of OpenAI or others who are really going to task saying, \"Hey, this is all this amalgamated stolen public data, much of it used without permission, unlicensed, but amalgamated into these single consolidated data stores.\" Now, some of my people even say this is just stolen data. But all this public data has been amalgamated into what they call training sets.\nThese training sets then get turned into what we call inference, which is how the AI then is able to start to deliver its insights. But there's other things that it's providing besides insights. These AI models, well, they could be considered very confident liars producing misinformation, hallucinations. Hallucinations are not a feature. Okay. And I'm going to get to that point in a second. And I think you all understand that already because at this point, we all have a high level of experience with AI, don't we? Everyone has had that experience. There's a danger, though, for companies, for enterprises, for our customers that these are not trusted solutions. Let me point out why that is, especially for companies who are in regulated markets. Why this is a big, big deal.\nThese models don't know anything about the company's customer relationships, and in some cases are just making it up. Enterprises need to have the same capabilities that are captivating consumers, those amazing things, but they need to have it with trust, and they need to have it with security. And it's not easy. Look, we all read the story. Now, it just happened last week. An airline chatbot, an airline chatbot prompted by a passenger to book a flight with a 90-day refund window. It turns out the chatbot, running on one of these big models, we won't have to use any brand names here. We all know who it was, hallucinated the option. It did not exist. We all know what that's like. We've all had the experience. So here's the chatbot. It hallucinates the option. It's working with the customers. It didn't exist. It did not exist.\nThe airline said, \"Oh, listen, that was just the chatbot. It gets that way sometimes. We're so sorry. You know what? That's just a separate technical entity, a separate legal entity.\" The airline, \"Oh, we can't. We're not going to be held liable for that.\" Well, guess what? That defense did not work in a court of law. The court of law said that that AI chatbot that made up that incredible new policy for that company, well, that company was going to be held responsible, liable for that policy, that they were going to be held liable for the work of that chatbot. Just as they would for a human employee, they were being held liable for a digital employee. The reality for every enterprise is that to deliver trusted AI experiences, you need these three essential components now. You need that compelling user interface.\nThere's no question, a natural and effortless experience. And at Salesforce, we have some of the most intuitive user interfaces that deliver insights and intelligence across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and industries. Many of you are on Slack right now. Many of you are on Tableau. Many of you are on MuleSoft, or one of our other products. Okay. Now, what else do you need? Number two, you need a world-class AI model. And now we know there's many, many models available. Just go to Hugging Face, which is a company that we're an investor in, or look at all the other models. And by the way, not only are there thousands of models right now, but there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of models coming. And all the models that are available today will be obsolete 12 months from now.\nSo we have to have an open, extensible, and trusted framework inside Salesforce to be receptacles for these models. That's why Einstein 1 is so important. Then you have to be able to use these AI models, the ones that Salesforce is developing, or these public models on Hugging Face or other things, or even bring your own model. Customers are even making their own models. Fantastic. Of course, we have great partnerships with OpenAI, with Anthropic, with Cohere, with many other AI models. This is the second key component. One is the UI. The second is the model. All right. Now, for those of us who put, for example, a copilot on our phone, any one of the copilots on the App Store, we have a compelling UI. And we know underneath there, there is a compelling model. But third, we also know there's a huge dataset there.\nBut here we go. Now we're in the enterprise. In the enterprise, you need deep integration of data and metadata for the AI to understand and deliver the critical insights and intelligence that customers need across their business, across sales, service, marketing, commerce, whatever it is. That deep integration of the data and metadata, that's not so easy. That's not just some amalgamated stolen public dataset. In the enterprise, that deep integration of data and metadata, oh, that's what Salesforce does. We are a deep integration of data and metadata. That is why it's very, very exciting. I like to say, and I love NVIDIA, by the way, and what Jensen has done is amazing. And they are delivering very much in the era of the gold rush, the Levi's jeans to the gold miners. But we all know where the gold is: the data. The gold is the data.\nThat's why we're so excited about Salesforce, because we are one of the very largest repositories of enterprise data and metadata in the world for our customers. And customers are just starting to realize this right now. And they try to stitch together a variety of AI tools, copilots, and this and that, and whatever. I've had so many funny conversations with so many customers who come to me that they're experts in AI and they're this. And then I just say to them, \"But how are you going to deliver this experience?\" And then finally they realize, \"Oh, I need the deep integration with the data and the metadata.\" The reason why the metadata is so important is because it describes the data. That's why so many companies are turning to Salesforce for their AI transformation.\nOnly Salesforce offers these critical layers of AI for our customers: the UI, the model, and the deep integration of the data and the metadata, and make the AI smart, intelligent, and insightful, and without the hallucinations, and without all of these other problems. For more than two decades, we've been trusted with our customers' data and metadata, and we have a lot of it. And a lot of you are our customers, so you understand what I'm saying. But many of our customers also have islands and thousands of systems of trapped data. Now, what I'm going to say is very simple. Trapped data is all over the enterprise.\nNow, what trapped data can be is you might be using a great company like Snowflake, and I love Snowflake, or Databricks, or Microsoft, or you might be using Amazon System or even something like Google, what these things, BigQuery, all these various databases. But put your hand up if you're using Snowflake every day. Put your hand up if you're using one of these other systems. Put your hand up if you're using Salesforce, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Tableau, Slack. We need to be able to, through our zero copy, automatically integrate into our Data Cloud all of those systems and then seamlessly provide that data back into these amazing tools. And that is what we are doing because so many of our customers have islands of trapped data in all of these systems.\nBut the AI is not going to work because it needs to have this seamless amalgamated data experience of data and metadata. That's why our Data Cloud is like a rocket ship. The entire AI revolution is built on this foundation of data, and it's why we're so excited about this incredible Data Cloud. It's now deeply integrated into all of our apps, into our entire platform. It's self-service for all of our customers to turn on. It is our fastest-growing product ever. It's our total focus for fiscal year 2025 with Salesforce Data Cloud. Salesforce can unlock this trapped data and bring together all of their business, and customer data into one place for AI, all while keeping their data safe and secure. And it's all running inside our Einstein Trust Layer. And we've deployed it to all of our customers.\nWe unleash now the copilot as well to all of our customers, deeply built on our data and metadata. While other copilots just sit and spin because they can't figure out what the data means, and if you haven't seen the demonstrations, you just see these copilots spin. When they use Salesforce, it all of a sudden becomes intelligent. That is the core of the Einstein 1 Platform. It's all of our apps, all of our AI capabilities, all of the customer data in one deeply integrated, trusted metadata platform. That's why we're seeing incredible demand for Data Cloud. Data Cloud brings it all together. We are so blessed to have Data Cloud in our company. It's also why in Q4, 25% of our deals already over $1 million have included Data Cloud.\nWe've recently added over 1,000 new customers to Data Cloud. We've never seen traction like this of a new product because you can just easily turn on the Data Cloud, and it adds huge value to Sales Cloud. It adds huge value to Service Cloud, to Marketing Cloud, to the CDP. You've all seen the Gartner Magic Quadrant that got published last week about the Data Cloud. Or if you haven't, go to my Twitter feed and you'll see how amazing that MQ is. And it's the fastest-growing organic product in the history of Salesforce. This last quarter, more than 7 trillion records, 7 trillion records were ingested into Data Cloud. Unbelievable. 7 trillion records ingested into Data Cloud with over a trillion activations driving customer engagement, lighting up all of those sales, service, marketing, cloud users, all the platform, Tableau. It's all integrated into Data Cloud.\nAnd because Data Cloud and all of Einstein 1 is built on our metadata framework, as I just described, every customer app can securely access and understand the data and use any model, use any UI workflow integrated with the platform. That means less complexity, more flexibility, faster innovation. But also, we want to say goodbye to these hallucinations. We want to say goodbye to all of these crazy experiences that we're having with these bots that don't know what they're doing because they have no data or metadata. Okay? Or the data that they have metadata is like productivity data, or like the highest-level data that's not deeply integrated data. So only Salesforce can do this. Only Salesforce has this vision of this kind of platform and only has—we've been working on this for 25 years, and we are not done.\nWe are just starting because let me tell you now a story of how we're delivering a high-quality trusted AI for our customers. We all know the HR and payroll leader, ADP, and their incredible new CEO, Maria Black. Amazing. ADP has been a great Sales Cloud customer for two decades. They've used Einstein for years. They were one of the first customers we ever have. We're so grateful to ADP. Amazing. And worked with so many of their great CEOs over the decades. The company wanted to transform now customer service with AI to give their agents real-time insights, next best actions, auto-generated case summaries. Well, I have to say to you, it was a little bit embarrassing. Salesforce was not number one on their list. And I said to them, \"How can that be? We're the number one Service Cloud. We're number one in the MQ.\nWe're number one in this. We're number one marketing.\" \"No, we're going to go evaluate this. We're going to look at all the different solutions. We're going to look at all the new AI models. We think we're just going to hook this model up to this, and we're going to do that.\" And it sounded like a big Rube Goldberg invention what was going to happen there. And so we had to go in, and we just wanted to partner with them and say, \"All right, show us what you want to do. We're going to work with you. We're going to be trusted partners. Let's go.\" But like a lot of our customers moving to AI, ADP realized it didn't have a comprehensive, deeply integrated platform of data and metadata that could bring together all of this into a single source of truth.\nAnd then you get the incredible customer service. Then you get the results that you're looking for, and it's deeply integrated with their sales systems, with marketing and custom applications. ADP discovered only Salesforce can do this. We were able to show ADP how we could unlock trapped data with Data Cloud, Zero Copy, drive intelligence, productivity, efficiency for their sales team with Einstein to levels unimagined just a year ago. We're now incredibly excited to work with all of our customers to take their AI to the next level with Einstein Copilot, which is going live tomorrow. Einstein Copilot, which if you haven't seen it, and if you haven't, please come to Trailhead DX next week. This is the first conversational AI assistant for the enterprise that's truly trusted. It's amazing. It can answer questions. It can summarize.\nIt can create new content, dynamically automate tasks on behalf of the user from the single consistent user experience embedded directly within our platform. But let me tell you the one thing that it can do that's more important than all of that. It is able to read across all the data and metadata in our platform to get that insight instantly. And you're going to see that. So the sales rep might ask the Einstein Copilot, \"What lead I should focus on?\" or \"What is the most important thing I need to do with this opportunity?\" And it may say, \"You need to resolve this customer's customer case because this escalation has been around for a week.\"\n\"You better go and answer that lead that came in on the Marketing Cloud before if you want to move this opportunity forward because it's reading across the entire dataset.\" That is something that individual users cannot do that the Copilot can do. With access to customer data and the metadata and Salesforce, including all this real-time data and website engagement and the ability to read through the dataset, that's why Einstein Copilot has all the context to understand the question and surface the lead that has the highest value and likelihood to convert.\nIt can also instantly generate the action plan with the best steps to close the deal, such as suggesting optimal meeting times, on-the-lead contacts, known preferences, even drafting an email. If you haven't seen the video that I put on my Twitter feed last night, there's a five-minute video that goes through all of these incredible things that it's able to do. There's never been an enterprise AI capability quite like it. It's amazing. All of us can understand the task that the copilot's performing. I bet a lot of people, even on this call, that a lot of other companies might say they can do this, but I assure you, without the deep integration of the data and the metadata across the entire platform with the copilot's deep integration of that data, they cannot do it. They cannot do it.\nI assure you they cannot because they don't have the data and the metadata, which is so critical to making an AI assistant so successful. I encourage you to try the demos yourself to put our copilot up against any other copilot because I'll tell you that I've seen enterprise copilots from these other companies in actions, and they just spin and spin and spin. Some have a different copilot for every app, some with different capabilities, restrictions, grounding, and this WYSIWYG builders on whatever. It's very cute, very nice, and exciting. It's really cool for the first minute, and then you realize, \"Wait a minute, what data is available to this copilot?\" Only a conversational UI, okay, can start to understand all these things if it has this access.\nOnly after a conversational UI for canned queries or don't understand the customers to customize the copilot, none of these things are going to work. I've used those copilots from the competitors. I have not seen them work yet. Okay. The thinking icon, the spinning, it goes on and on and on and on. Einstein Copilot, you're going to see you're going to have your hands on it now. It's been released into the wild to our customers, to all of you. This is fundamentally a different kind of AI. Just like Einstein was a different AI, which became the democratization of AI, which is why Einstein does a trillion transactions a week. Einstein's the only copilot with the ability to truly understand what's going on with your customer relationships. It's one conversational AI assistant, deeply connected to trusted customer data and metadata.\nIt's one integrated system for all of our customers across any role or industry, and it's why we call it Einstein 1. It's one platform, one integrated system. That is what you need to get AI to work. Next week at our Trailhead DX conference in San Francisco, I hope you're all coming. It's going to be amazing. On 6 March and 7 March, you're going to see how we're bringing even more AI innovation to our customers. So be prepared to be amazed by Einstein Copilot Builder, Prompt Builder, Model Builder, and so much more that we're doing to help our customers make every employee more productive and transform every customer experience. And I hope you're going to join us in person, or you can join us online at Salesforce+.\nWith closing, I just want to thank all of you once again for everything that you've done for us for the last year. We're so grateful to each and every one of you and to our entire management team, all our Ohana, and all of our customers as well. We're so grateful as we look forward now to our 25th anniversary on 8 March. I've never been more excited. You can hear why. Not just the fundamental transformation of the company, but also the fundamental transformation of the product line and the product vision as we move into this incredible new intelligent world that we're all seeing with AI.\nThank you. And now I'm turning it over to Brian, who was employee number 13, our chief operating officer. He's done a phenomenal job this year. Without him and without Amy, without our whole management team, it would not be possible. I just want to thank again everyone who's been a huge part of everything. I'll turn it over to you, Brian. Here we go.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nWell, thank you, Marc. I really appreciate it. I couldn't be more proud to be part of Salesforce the past 25 years, especially this past year as we took on a pivotal business transformation while delivering incredible innovation for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Our continued focus on operational excellence, high performance, and new growth initiatives helped deliver strong results in the fiscal year and remains our focus going forward. At FY 2024, we laid the foundation for success through strategic restructuring, streamlining our go-to-market approach, deeper inspection, and continued operational excellence.\nAs part of our transformation, we also refined and scaled our big deal motion and introduced new product bundles to give our customers comprehensive solutions on a unified, trusted platform. We're unlocking customer spend with new channels like AWS Marketplace and driving C-level relevance through strategic collaboration with McKinsey. The adjustments we made are paying off. As Marc mentioned, our deals greater than $10 million in FY 2024 grew substantially, 78% year-over-year, and we closed 86,000 multi-cloud deals. Our pricing and packaging strategy is driving higher sales and delivering more value for companies of all sizes and industries. Since launching in April, we've added 3,000 new logos through self-service with Salesforce Starter, a solution for small businesses that includes sales, service, and marketing with AI and Data Cloud built in. We're excited by the momentum we're seeing in UE+ bundle, which is now called Einstein 1 Edition.\nIt's providing substantial returns for our customers and for Salesforce. In fact, we continue to see significant average sales price uplift from existing customers who upgrade to Einstein 1 Edition. It's also attracting new customers to Salesforce. 15% of the companies that purchased our Einstein 1 Edition in FY 2024 were net new logos. As you heard from Marc, with our Einstein 1 Platform, including Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot, we're rapidly infusing conversational AI across our entire product portfolio. Einstein 1 is a huge differentiator for us in the industry transforming, excuse me, as the industry transforms in this AI revolution. It's the fastest and safest way to unlock an organization's data to create better customer experiences, augment employees with AI, and drive productivity and improve margins and profitability. Every AI strategy starts with data. As Marc said, Data Cloud has strong momentum.\nData Cloud is approaching $400 million in ARR, growing at nearly 90% year-over-year. In Q4, 25% of our deals greater than $1 million included Data Cloud. Customers like Xerox, London Stock Exchange, and Daikin turned to Data Cloud in Q4 to build their trusted data foundations and unlock their trapped data within Salesforce. We're excited about our future. We just were named, as Marc mentioned, the leader in the inaugural February 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for customer data platforms. I met with dozens of CEOs and business leaders over the past few months, and they're all focused on fueling growth and strengthening customer relationships within their current budgets and workforce. They see AI as the tool to augment their people and drive more productivity. Companies like ADP, are investing in Einstein 1 to become AI-first organizations.\nIn FY 2024, we closed 1,300 Einstein deals as more customers are leveraging our generative and predictive AI capabilities. Take Schneider Electric. They wanted to standardize and simplify customer care across their 3,000 support agents, speaking 15 different languages around the world. Instead of talking to customers, service agents were spending way too much time searching for answers across different systems and summarizing cases. Dealing with 7 million cases per year leads to time-consuming interactions for their support agents. Now, Einstein will automatically create email replies that agents can use to respond and summarize their cases. With the power of Einstein 1, Schneider Electric support teams are already seeing a 15% increase in case efficiencies. It's not just their service agents. Their sales teams are also seeing incredible benefits from our AI capabilities.\nWe're just at the beginning of a new innovation cycle that will spark a massive software buying cycle over the coming years, and Salesforce is leading the way. We continue to see strong demand for our data products as customers lay the foundation for AI. Specifically, MuleSoft is helping companies such as Rossignol and TK Elevator North America bring together their data from any source, a critical step to prepare for AI. MuleSoft was in eight of our top 10 deals in the quarter and executed a record 319 billion automated workflows every month, up 100% year-over-year. Tableau was in 20 of our top 25 deals in the quarter and is fully integrated to Data Cloud. Wins in the quarter included customers like IHG, Heathrow Airport, and Brazilian fintech stone.\nTableau Pulse, a phenomenal new product that's just been released, generally available last week, actually, already has 2,000 customers. Powered by Data Cloud and Einstein, Tableau Pulse automatically delivers personalized AI-powered insights in both a natural language and visual format. We're also excited about the innovation coming from Slack, which was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We just launched Slack AI with features like AI search, channel recaps, and thread summaries to meet the enormous demand for embedded AI in the flow of work from customers like Australian Post and OpenAI. It's amazing to see what Slack has accomplished in a decade. And frankly, it's just the beginning. We have a great vision for the future of Slack as a conversational interface for any application.\nOur specialized industry products continue to fuel our growth, chosen in the quarter by customers like Japan Post Insurance, TPG Telecom, and USDA. Collectively, our industry businesses finished the year at 4.8 billion ARR, up more than 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth internationally with wins at Volvo, Genpact, Hitachi, and Boticário. India continues to be a bright spot for us, growing new business at 35% year-over-year, and we continue to invest in the region to meet the needs of customers, including Bajaj Finance. I had the great opportunity to meet with their CEO, Rajeev Jain, in January, and a top priority for him was using Einstein to deliver predictive and generative AI across their entire lending business, which they run on Salesforce. In Q4, Bajaj became the second largest Data Cloud customer globally, building their AI foundation on the Einstein 1 Platform.\nI want to close by acknowledging that our success is only possible because of our phenomenal employees, incredible partners, trailblazers, shareholders, and amazing customers who have trusted us for 25 years. As we proved in FY 2024, when we focus on something as a company, we deliver results. In FY 2025, that focus is on profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. Let me join Marc and Brian in saying what a year it has been for Salesforce. At this time last year, we laid out our accelerated transformation plan, and I am incredibly proud of the significant progress we made this year against that plan. Throughout fiscal 2024, we delivered on increasing profitability, revenue, productivity, and operational excellence. Q4 represents another quarter of strong execution and continued discipline across the business. Now, let's turn to the results.\nFor the Q4, revenue was $9.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 10% in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by resilient sales and service performance, as well as strength in MuleSoft and Tableau. For the full year, revenue was $34.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14% or 11% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in LATAM, India, and Canada, while parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q4, public sector and travel, transportation, and hospitality both performed well, while retail and consumer goods, and high tech were generally more measured. Our multi-cloud momentum also continued.\nIn Q4, eight of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds, and more than half of our top 100 wins included six or more clouds. As you've already heard, AI starts with data, and we are seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud. In Q4, more than half of our top 25 wins included Data Cloud. Q4 revenue attrition ended the quarter at slightly above 8%, generally in line with recent quarters. In Q4, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.4%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, in line with our guidance, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%, up 800 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating margin ended the year at 14.4%, up 1,110 basis points year-over-year. Q4 operating cash flow was $3.4 billion, up 22% year-over-year.\nQ4 free cash flow was $3.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow was a record $10.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year. Full year free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 50% year-over-year. Now, turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q4 at an incredible $56 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or cRPO, ended at $27.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency, particularly driven by strong execution on early renewals. We also benefited from new business performance and timing of license revenue from MuleSoft and Tableau. As expected, this was partially offset by a one-point headwind from professional services, which we had noted last quarter. Now, let's turn to guidance, starting with full fiscal year 2025.\nOn revenue, we expect $37.7 to 38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. A few items to note on our revenue guide. Our expectations incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year-over-year, or a 30 basis points impact. We also expect our professional services business to remain under pressure in FY 2025 and expect it will be a headwind to revenue. Within our revenue guidance, subscription and support revenue growth is expected to be slightly above 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Now, as a reminder, our top-line expectations include the impact from the measured buying environment that began back in fiscal year 2023. This takes time to flow through our subscription revenue stream due to the like effect of bookings to revenue recognition. That said, we continue to execute well in the measured buying environment.\nOver the past two quarters, I'm happy to say that we've seen improved bookings growth. As you heard from Marc, we're incredibly well-positioned to build on our success and bring our customers into this new AI era. Now, turning to attrition, starting in fiscal 2025, we are including Slack invoicing in the metric. Despite expecting a modest headwind, we expect attrition to remain consistent at slightly above 8%. On margins, we continue to drive operational excellence, productivity, and efficiency. For fiscal year 2025, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, representing a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year, while still making key investments in growth opportunities, notably AI, data, and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is expected to be below 8% as a percent of revenue as we continue to take a disciplined approach to our equity-based programs.\nAs a result, for the fiscal year 2025, I am pleased that our GAAP operating margin guidance, for the first time, is expected to surpass 20% at 20.4%, representing a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year 2025 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.07 to 6.15. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.68 to 9.76. As a result of our focus on profitable growth and continued transformation, we are seeing a marked improvement in our cash flow outcomes. We expect fiscal year 2025 operating cash flow growth of approximately 21% to 24%, which includes a 10-point year-over-year headwind from cash taxes. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23% to 26% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q1.\nOn revenue, we expect $9.12 billion to 9.17 billion, up 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. This includes a tailwind from the timing of license revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau. Additionally, Q1 has a one-point benefit from an extra day of revenue recognition given the leap year, which has no impact on our full year revenue or cRPO. cRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be 11% year-over-year in nominal and 12% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.42 to 1.44 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.37 to 2.39. Now to capital return. We are deeply committed to driving free cash flow and return to our shareholders while investing in new organic growth initiatives.\nIn Q4, we returned $1.7 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total returned in FY 2024 to $7.7 billion, or more than 80% of fiscal year free cash flow, which more than fully offset dilution from our stock-based compensation. Since the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. I'm incredibly excited to announce our first-ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long-term cash flow. Our board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40. More details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to 30 billion.\nBased on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion. In closing, I want to echo Marc and Brian. This has been an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of the progress we have made throughout the company. We are executing with discipline while also investing for our future. I want to personally thank our employees who have worked so hard this past year and thank our shareholders for their continued support over this past transformational year. Now, Mike, I think we better open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy. Briann, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star one. Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader and Internet Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nMarc, last quarter, you had said that you're starting to see some green shoots, and we're not ready to say you completely turned the corner, but I'm just curious if you could give everyone an update in terms of just what you're seeing from customer behavior and ultimately how you think that plays out through the year. Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nIt's a great question, and I think, you know, Amy will go back and say, you know, it was really this kind of moment in the middle of fiscal year, whatever it was, 2023, where we started to see this kind of weird behavior. And then I would say starting last quarter, like you said, we saw these green shoots, and now I would really say it was kind of a 180.\nThat it's really that, you know, AI. Every customer realizes, number one, they've got to start a major investment cycle if they're going to remain competitive. Every customer is trying to achieve more productivity. I think we all know what that means. We certainly do. We've had to achieve more productivity ourselves over the last year. And that is really about, in many cases, augmenting your employees. A lot of you have heard my Gucci story. There's so many stories. There's going to be so many more stories where these tools all of a sudden really start to deliver much more productivity, better customer relationships, and higher margins. CEOs get that. I think that is driving the 180. Obviously, we're also in the third phase of the pandemic. The first phase we all went through together was horrible. It was my first pandemic.\nI had never been through anything like it. Then all of a sudden, we were in the post-pandemic where we were in this crazy interest rate and inflation environment. Now we're in the third phase, post-post-pandemic. In post-post-pandemic, things are just better, not just because we're going through this technology surge, but because all this other stuff is behind us and we're in a new normal and people know, hey, we need to invest to grow. We need to invest in technology to grow. That, I think, is really driving the 180 for our customers, for ourselves. I think for a lot of you, we can all see it in the equity markets. That is not the equity markets that we had in 2021. We are in a new place and we are ready to deliver. You're going to have, you can be the judge yourself.\nWhen we get to Trailer DX, I hope that you're all going to text and email me. Most of you have my text and email. Text and email me and tell me what you think. Because if you see anyone else being able to deliver on the promise of enterprise AI at the level of quality, scale, and capability of Salesforce, I'll be very surprised. And this is driving through different geographies, through different product portfolios. Green shoots. Brian, I want you to come in here and talk about these green shoots, but really the 180 that we're seeing in the market.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Yeah, I really appreciate it. And we are seeing tremendous demand for Data Cloud and for AI. I do think, Brent, that we are still operating in a measured environment and we are still having to ensure that we're doing the deep inspection and managing the business very tightly in the way that we have over the past six, seven quarters in this environment. The green shoots around Data Cloud, around MuleSoft, regional performance that we've seen have been really outstanding in Canada, LATAM, and Spain. I mentioned the India performance on the call. Our focus on industries is really paying big dividends. So we are seeing parts of our business really accelerate, but there certainly are still some measured environments out there that we have to continue to take into account the way that we manage this business.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAmy, I think you should come in here and also talk about how you've seen the transformation of the business and that the green shoots that you see happening are kind of the 180 that I'm talking about.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nSure. It's been an incredible couple of years. You know, Marc, as you mentioned, going back to really the beginning of July and fiscal year 2023, where we so suddenly saw this measured buying environment, the elongated sales cycles, the additional approvals, the compressed deals. And over the last few years, what I've really seen is not so much a shift in the buying behavior, but a shift in our ability to execute in it. And I think we've seen that over the last couple of quarters in particular, that we are just executing much better in this. I do think that there is a lot of excitement to come on AI and data, and we'll see how that plays out this year.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Brianna, we'll take the next question now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Congratulations on another really nice quarter. A question just on sort of buying cycles and sort of the timing for this AI goodness to kind of come into the numbers. And maybe it's a question for Brian. How should we think about how customers are ingesting this, right? Like, how are they purchasing the Einstein platform? Does it start with Data Cloud and then they move into more of the application functionality?\nThen importantly, how should investors think about when this could potentially impact numbers, when this will become material enough to see the inflection in kind of revenue growth? Then maybe one for Amy. Another 200 basis points of operating margin expansion in the guide. Super impressive. Can you give us some indications of where that's coming from, where there are the additional areas of leverage that you're seeing in the business?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nFirst of all, Keith, thank you. I really appreciate the question. You kind of nailed it in your question. We're seeing our customers with tremendous desire to take advantage of AI capabilities to drive the efficiencies in their business, to drive higher margins and productivity. But it all starts with data. And so you saw some of the numbers that we put out. In my comments, Data Cloud approaching $400 billion and growing 90% year-over-year.\nThis should be an indicator of the demand that we're seeing for people to get ready for the AI transformation they want to put their company through. So we're really excited about the opportunity ahead. But every customer I talk to says, \"I've got trapped data. I don't have a great data strategy. My architecture is off.\" And that's why we're seeing such great performance on our Data Cloud products. On the AI front, I think we're going to start to see that show up further out in this fiscal year. We don't have a lot of it factored into our guide right now, to be candid, just because there's so much work that needs to happen. Now, the demand is heavy. And as we just launched this Copilot product yesterday, just announced it and launched it tomorrow, as you'll see next week at TDX, enormous demand for it.\nAnd we think we have a massive opportunity to go faster here. And so big upside, but not a lot factored in here. And I'm going to flip it over to Amy to talk a little bit about some of that.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nSure. So just following up, Brian, on the comments in terms of the new products. You know, on Data Cloud, we're already seeing this great traction, which is certainly factored in. On some of the Gen AI, it's still early. And given the adoption curve, at really our size and scale as a $38 billion company, we're not factoring in material contribution from these new products into our FY 2025 revenue guidance at this time. Turning on our margin, yes, really happy to see another 200 basis points this year as a commitment.\nThis year, we are just seeing amazing leverage from many of the hard decisions we made last year. They're continuing to flow through and really benefiting the business. You know, a few things I would call out: a lot of discipline around headcount over the past year. We are starting to grow in some areas at this point, but it's really investing into our most productive areas, AI, data. And we're doing that in cost-effective ways, really trying to leverage areas that have high, high talent pools and low costs. We're also looking at things like top line, you know, how are we doing with our product and pricing? What are we doing in terms of go-to-market efficiencies? Brian has been great this past year in making changes and driving productivity. I think you'll see additional changes coming, additional benefits coming from all of those areas.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Brianna, we'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, thank you very much. Marc, as you talked, you talked to a lot of CEOs, right, across all the breadth of industries. What are they saying about their business and their propensity to spend real dollars in Data Cloud with Salesforce? And if that comes true, could the company reaccelerate top line? One for you, Amy. You seem to sound confident that leading indicators are rebounding. What are those leading indicators? We can't quantify, at least qualitatively. Can you talk about the leading indicators and how much of a lag is there between those indicators and how they show up in revenue? Thank you so much and congrats.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, Kash, this is, you know, basically, you know, what every software company wants. You want a new killer app. Sometimes you can get it through organic innovation. Sometimes you get it through inorganic innovation. We got lucky. We've done it with organic innovation with Data Cloud. I think Data Cloud is everything that we want at this moment for a few different reasons. First of all, yes, it's an incredible new cloud. We've seen what that kind of can do for Salesforce when we had Sales Cloud to Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud to Platform. Of course, we also had these other clouds that we picked up, you know, inorganically: Commerce, Tableau, Slack, etc., but this incredible new organic cloud. The difference with this cloud, and the difference between what's ever happened with Salesforce before, this cloud makes every other cloud better.\nSo the hot, new, exciting version of Sales Cloud, the hottest new feature in Sales Cloud, what's going to transform the tens of thousands of Sales Cloud customers that we have out there that we've been working on building for the last two and a half decades is Data Cloud. Service Cloud, the new version of Service Cloud is the Service Cloud plus Data Cloud and Marketing Cloud, read the Gartner MQ. We vanquished all of the other competitors completely with this product because it's so deeply integrated with what we're doing already and everything else in marketing. And the platform is extended with Data Cloud.\nAnd if you have this other data infrastructure in your company, any of the, you know, the BigQuery, the Redshift, and the Snowflake, I went through all this, it's made better with Data Cloud because it unleashes that trapped data to your users. This is a compelling reason to use Data Cloud all by itself. But that would be if we were not in the greatest transformation of our industry with artificial intelligence where we so badly need this data. Yes, we always love to have another data lake. We would have loved to have a data lake integrated with Sales Cloud many years ago. Okay, we have that. But why is it more important right now? Yes, we have the data lake, we have the repository, we have the warehouse, but now it has deeply also integrated into the AI.\nThat is why every customer must buy this product if they are going to achieve the nirvana that we can see for businesses, the trinity that we talked about, productivity, customer relationships, and margins, when you get data and AI working together. We can do it. This is our message to our salespeople, to our partners, to all of you. This is an incredible moment. That is why we have to execute like hell this year. Fiscal year 2025 needs to be one thing, the year of Data Cloud.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, great. Kash, thanks for the question about leading indicators. I think first you obviously heard the excitement about Data Cloud. If you didn't.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI can go through it again. You have it. You can get it.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nIf you would like.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI'll go one more time.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nSo let's just start with that when I'm looking at a leading indicator. So, specifically, there are a number of things that we look at that tend to be leading indicators that things may not be as good. Now, that would be something like create and close, S&B, self-serve. I've talked a lot about those over the past few years. But I do feel very good about some things I'm seeing right now. It is the execution from our team. And we've really seen this over the past two quarters.\nThat's really led to improved bookings growth. We think AE productivity, that is up. Brian talked a lot about that last quarter. It was fantastic. We look at our pipeline for indications of going forward. You know, that said, as we talked about, our top line expectations do include the lagging impact from the measured buying environment that began a couple of years ago. It's just going to take time for that to work through our system. But I am seeing some nice indicators that give me a lot of hope.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kash. Brianna, we'll take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Maybe a two-parter for Brian, two elements of the business that I think you have responsibility for. One is around pricing and bundling, and you mentioned Einstein 1. Just curious, when will that be a needle mover for revenues? How much of that uplift are you baking into the guide this year? And then also on the pro services side, typically not a focus area for anybody on this call, but down 9% in the quarter was obviously an inflection down. What's happening with that? Is that tight discretionary spend, or is that Salesforce consciously pushing more work to your SI partners? Thanks on both.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, so before you hit that, I want you to hit the service, but before you do that, when you think AI and you think, obviously, we all know what ACV is. I think it's basically a term that we created. Now it's industry-wide. AOV, CSM, Brian, you created that. ACV, this year, we obviously have huge goals internally. Okay. A material part of this ACV needs to be Data Cloud. This is important. This is the AI number. This is everything. The AI, Einstein 1, the artificial intelligence, Data Cloud, we have to bring this all together. That's why we call it Einstein 1. Look at the Einstein 1 SKU. Look at what we call UE+. That is where you're going to see the material ACV traction.\nThat is our focus and tension. Of course, we don't know what's going to really happen, you know, but when we got all of our, you know, we did a huge kickoff last week in Vegas. We brought 5,000 of our top executives, most 80% for sales. We had 70,000 online. We had one message to them: Data Cloud. Number one Data Cloud. Number one AI. Become a great storyteller about these stories. Number two. Number three, sell UE+, sell Einstein 1. Number four, deliver the customer success. Number five, our incredible new Ohana culture. These are the five things we're doing this year. So it's deeply integrated with that. And this absolutely must be part of everything we're doing. But when you think AI, think Data Cloud, Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Marc. Karl, back to your question. On pricing and bundling, we're excited about the progress we've made here. UE+ is a good example of what we're seeing. Good acceleration. It's not the only thing we're doing in pricing and packaging. Obviously, we did a price increase last year and seeing some benefits to that. Certainly, we're simplifying the way that we are putting quotes in the market, fewer SKUs, making it easier for our sellers to get out there. In terms of materiality in the short term, you're not going to really see it show up. We did it in the second half of last year. And so while we've seen great progress and there's a lot of promise for it, in terms of this year's revenue guide, not a huge factor in our growth numbers this year.\nYou will see it start to show up in year two and three as we roll through the renewals, the uplift, et cetera, and some of the incremental pricing changes that we're going to do. On pro serve, a good question. I think the big issue, and it's really been felt across the entire professional services industry, a bit of headwinds on customers' willingness to do massive transformation. We really felt that during the pandemic, that customers were coming to us and saying, \"I want to make a multi-year commitment to your services and spend a significant amount of money on these very large transactions and services.\" Now our customers are saying, \"Hey, let me take a smaller bite at the apple. Let me start smaller, get to time to value faster.\nLet me get the benefits of the technology sooner.\" And so while the demand remained high, it's just smaller transactions that are getting done vis-à-vis last year and the year before that. So the, you know, tough comparison on large deals, smaller transactions. For us, in a lot of ways, very good. Let's get our customers proving out the technology. Let's go faster, but having an impact on our professional services business right now.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Karl. Brianna, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much for Amy and Brian. The gross margin and sales efficiency metrics are quite strong this quarter. I'm curious just from a standpoint of eating your own dog food or drinking your own champagne, have you been able to realize any benefit from deploying either Service GPT or Sales GPT internally to save time for your own customer support agents or your own sales teams? I'm just wondering if you're, are they suddenly becoming more productive or able to do more with less already?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Mark, thank you. We are a big believer on sales on Salesforce. We are deploying our own AI technology internally. Our sales teams are using it absolutely. We are seeing benefits right now. But the biggest benefit we've seen actually has been in our support operation with case summaries, our ability to get to tap into knowledge bases faster, to get knowledge surfaced within the flow of work.\nAnd so it absolutely is part of our margin expansion strategy going forward, which is how do we leverage our own AI to drive more efficiencies in our business, to augment the work that's being done in sales, in service, and in marketing, and even into our commerce efforts as well. So we're excited about the future there as well as leveraging our own technology to drive those efficiencies. Amy, I don't know if you have anything else to add to that.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nNo, I think that was great, Brian. We have to be customer number one and use it, and I'm excited that we are. Lots of opportunities for us.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Mark. Brianna, we'll take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on a great fiscal year. I don't know if Brian or Marc wants to take this one, but we realize AI is applicable to every industry. But I was just kind of curious, are there any industries that you believe are farther along in terms of taking advantage of AI where either, frankly, it could be a domino effect due to the competitive advantage? You know, one customer could get over another if they don't start down this path.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nA very good question and an unknown. I mean, this is the future. Look, does anybody really know what is going to happen? I mean, we saw a Minority Report, WarGames. It was written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz, at Salesforce many decades ago. We've seen the movies, you know, Her, Terminator. Is this our future? Do we really know what's going to happen?\nYou know, look, at the end of the day, we all know that everything is underway with AI. The future is unfolding before our eyes. And we all remember the Minority Report scene when Tom Cruise walks into the Gap store and the whole store turns into a highly personalized experience and the digital sales agents and the human sales agents all start talking, \"Oh, we got those jeans last time. You need to buy the new jeans this time.\" Listen, if I go into the Gap store right now and I love the Gap, amazing new CEO, San Francisco company, fantastic, incredible work, you know, work with him at Mattel. But the store has not yet transformed into the Tom Cruise scene. We know that. Okay. But great products, great brand, great company, great lineage, great founders. Okay.\nWe are on the verge of something huge happening for all of our customers. We have to be driving that. We think we have the solution. This is going to happen. We also need to be guiding it with the right values. We all know that. We have to have the right core values. I went to this AI safety summit. You know, not enough focus on values. The values, not just the woke values that we're seeing in these filters, which are horrible, but the values of trust, you know, and that story I told you on the script.\nWhen I saw that last week, I'm like, I'm putting this in the script that this company, which is a great company and a customer of ours, but did not use our technology, went out there and used some kind of rogue AI that they picked off the internet, you know, some engineer just hobbled it, cooked it up, and then it started just spewing these hallucinations and falsehoods around their loyalty program, and the courts are holding them liable. Good. Let every CEO wake up and realize we are on the verge of one of the greatest transformations in the history of technology. But, trust must be our highest value.\nThat is why at Salesforce, we are going to lead this, not just with great technology, like you see, but also, and I just put on my Twitter feed, I hope you see at the top of my Twitter feed the results for the quarter, but please watch the five-minute video that's on the Twitter feed so you can understand coming into Trail of DX, what we are delivering with AI, a trust-based AI for enterprises built on our data and metadata. This is what's truly important.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks. Brianna, we'll take our last question now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Brad Zelnik with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. Listen, great to see the Data Cloud traction, the recognition in Gartner's Magic Quadrant. Marc, I appreciate you taking us into why the architecture is different from general purpose data platforms that, you know, and that it brings together the data and the metadata. But my question is a two-parter. A, it's clear Data Cloud is optimized for customer data and customer-related apps. Can you take it beyond that? Then B, how much of the customer base today is really viable to take Einstein 1 on and UE+ at a 50% higher list price point? And how far penetrated are we into that? Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I'm going to do the first part, and then I'm going to turn it over to Mike Spencer to do the second, because he not only runs AIR, but he also runs FP&A, and he's been doing that analysis. So I know he was going to come in on this. Look, number one, this is a huge upsell opportunity for us. You probably know, I think not even 50% of our Sales Cloud users use Service Cloud. Not even 50% of our Service Cloud users use Sales Cloud. Mea culpa. That is on us.\nOkay? I wish I could say that all of our sales users are service users or service users are sales users, but even ADP that I talked about in the script, who we've worked with for more than two decades, and I remember the first time I made a sales call there to extract SQL from their infrastructure, was not yet using us for service. So we have a lot of work to do to sell our existing clouds into our customers and also to upsell our existing customers and cross-sell them with Data Cloud, with Einstein 1, with the full platform.\nWe're rewriting our whole platform to be deeply integrated. We will no longer have all these separate acquired platforms. When we're done, we have one integrated platform, Einstein 1, one unified data and metadata platform. This is something I have deeply focused on in the last year to make sure it's clear to all of our engineers and our also finance that this must be funded, which it is. And then we will deliver this capability, and then we will light up and give you these great success stories. Look, some companies operate at the highest level of the user and the productivity level. That's not where we are. Okay? Some companies, okay, they operate maybe at the model level. That's also not where we are. We are a data company. We operate at the data level. Yes, we're about customer success made possible by data.\nThis is an AI revolution. It's a data revolution. There's no question. You cannot have the AI without the data. That's why those AI companies stole all that consumer data so they could have some, you know, semblance of these party tricks. For the enterprise, it's not going to fly. You've got to have these comprehensive data sets that are informed by the metadata. Mike's now going to answer the second part, and we'll wrap it up. Mike, go ahead.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Brad, thanks for the question. I think the way to think about the price uplift moving to Einstein 1 Edition used to be Unlimited Edition+ is really about the value that we're providing to our customers, because at the end of the day, our ability to get increased price is about the value that we're going to provide.\nAnd so as customers start to ramp up their abilities on AI, ramp up their learnings, and understand what it means for them economically, our ability to get price will be dictated by that. Early signs of that are pretty strong. We feel good about the progress we've seen. It's only been in market for four plus months now in FY 2024, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. But at the end of the day, we're trying to make it as simple as we can for our customers to buy it, but it's going to be predicated on the value.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nI agree. And just one last comment, Brad. It's Brian. We want to be able to deliver Data Cloud and AI at all levels in all segments. And you see that in our offering around Salesforce Starter, where we're building AI and Data Cloud capabilities as part of that. So every segment of our customer base should be able to enjoy the power of AI and Data Cloud.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nSo thanks for the question, Brad. And we thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Thanks all.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect."

After management's prepared remarks, we will open the floor to questions. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press star one. Again, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on fiscal 2024 Q3 results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results, and guidance, can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which could change should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nActual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Hey Mike, thanks so much, and thanks for all your hard work this year. It's been an incredible year, and also I just really appreciate everyone being here on the call today. I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. I hope you're all preparing a fantastic holiday for yourself coming up. I know it's been an incredible year for so many of the folks on this call, and you know, I just encourage all of my folks to try to take a couple days off and do a little digital detox, and I hope you get a chance to do that as well.\nAs we come into the season, we're obviously super excited about these results we've delivered in this unbelievable quarter and in this unbelievable year and this double-digit revenue growth delivering non-GAAP margin exceeding 30%. You know this is really exciting for us when we look at these numbers. When we think about having an $8.7 billion quarter, 31.2% margin in the quarter. And then talking about this year at 34.8%, Fiscal Year 2024, amazing with 30.5% margin growth, you know, whether it's 800%, 900%, 1,000% increase from year over year, these numbers all exceed what we thought we were able to do.\nAnd I'll tell you, we really did this in partnership with all of you. I'm just going to come back to that a couple times to give you the gratitude and thanks that you deserve for everything you've been doing to help us have an unbelievably great year. But I'll tell you, it's more than just a great year. It's also a huge year of transformation. I think everyone on the call knows that it's exactly a year ago. And as you remember, or maybe I'd like to forget exactly how crazy that year got. And it was a really unusual year. But we knew we had to change. We knew there had to be transformation.\nWe knew there were things that had to get done. We knew, look, that we were going to have to restructure our business for the short and long term. We talked about that in each of the last several calls. We knew we had to focus on increasing profitability, productivity, and operational excellence across the board. We knew that. We knew that we had to really double down on our core, deliver some strong relationships with you, our investors. Then I'll just keep coming back to that, that you've been just such great partners in making all this happen. I'll tell you that.\nWe have to stay focused on continuing to be this number one AI CRM, which we've been doing. You're going to hear about that today, really finding these incredible, these incredible growth factors for the company. You know what people have been asking me, why am I so excited about this quarter? Brian's going to hit on this as well, and Amy's going to hit on this as well. You know, the three things that keep coming back to me.\nExcuse me, number one, that we have 80% growth in deals more than $1 million that is far exceeding our expectations. That we were able to pull together all of these different clouds into this kind of what we call a cocktail. You know, the customers were wanting to buy Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, you know, the Data Cloud, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, all of that, we're able to build these big transactions. And there's no question that, that, you know, kind of fell off last year. Now, to see that come back, that is just really exciting. Brian's going to talk about that.\nNumber two, we have a great new product, and everyone knows here at Dreamforce Data Cloud; you can see in the quarter 1,000 new Data Cloud customers. That is number two thing. I am really excited that I literally just got off the plane from Tokyo. You probably all saw me yesterday at Salesforce World Tour. Tokyo was incredible. Everyone is very excited about Salesforce in Japan, now the second largest software company in Japan. Incredible what has happened over there in the market. I met with hundreds of customers while I was there. I spoke to some of the CEOs of the largest companies in Japan.\nIt was an incredible week. It was the momiji season, which is the fall season with incredible fall leaves. Beautiful over there. And I'll tell you, everyone wants to talk about Data Cloud, and that is really exciting to have an incredible driver for future growth. And the third thing is these Einstein GPT Copilots. So, we've delivered these Einstein GPT Copilots. You know, this is a product we didn't really even have an imagination around a year ago. Of course we had Einstein. Of course we could see the incredible growth of Einstein.\nI mean, now Einstein with predictive and generative combined is doing a trillion transactions a week. That's amazing. But more amazing is that 17% of the Fortune 100 are now Einstein GPT Copilot customers. And this is a product that is just coming to market. Everyone is so excited about buying this product. So, when you see these larger deals, when you see Data Cloud, when you see these Einstein GPT Copilots going into place, that is why we are excited about our growth and why we're excited about this quarter. And then you look at the financial metrics. You know, the $1.5 billion in cash flow up about 1,000%. That is another reason why we're excited about the quarter.\nSo, let me get into the script a little bit and let me talk to kind of give you the structured messages and then turn this over to Brian. So, number one, we are the number one AI CRM. If that isn't clear already, we're leading the industry through the unprecedented AI innovation cycle. It's unlike anything I've seen, and most of the people that I talk to all over the world feel the same way. We're the only platform that is bringing CRM, data, AI, and trust together for our customers in a way that enables them across every industry to be more successful faster, to be more productive, more efficient.\nWe're the number one by market share for the 10th year in a row. Based on the latest IDC software tracker, we're the number one enterprise apps company now. That's amazing. Data Cloud, this hyperscale, this real-time customer data platform that is performing incredibly well for us. It's the foundation of every AI transaction, but it's the foundation of every large deal that we did this quarter. That is what is so exciting. In Q3, our Q3, Data Cloud has ingested an astonishing 6.4 trillion records. 6.4 trillion records, that's a 140% year-over-year increase. It triggered 1.4 trillion activations, a 220% increase year over year.\nThis is a monster product. I could not be more excited. It's the perfect time. We didn't really understand that it was going to line up so well with this generative AI revolution. This is a product we've been working on for a couple of years. There's the timing of it has been incredible because listen, if you don't have your data together in a company, you're not going to deliver AI. It's not like companies are going to run their AI off of Reddit or off of, of some kind of big public data set. They have to have their data set together to make AI work for them. And that is why the Data Cloud is so powerful for them.\nNow as I've said before, this AI revolution is going to be a trust revolution. It's not just about CRM, data or AI; it's also about trust. I think the trust layer and the way that we've architected our platform so that our customers are not basically getting taken advantage of, of these next generation large language model, these foundation models, they are so hungry for all of this data, and they want our customers' data, you know, so that they can grow. We're not going to let them have it.\nWe're going to separate ourselves from those models through a trust layer, so customers can be protected. This is going to be so important for the future of how Salesforce architects itself with artificial intelligence. Now, revenue of the quarter was $8.7 billion. Not too many software executives get to say it, so I think I'll say it twice actually. Revenue for the quarter was $8.7 billion, up 11% year over year. Incredible.\nThird largest enterprise software company now by revenue, also, incredible, and companies standardizing on Salesforce as their core technology platform, doing these multi cloud deals with us, getting that growth, as I said, that incredible stat that Brian's going to come back to, the 80% growth in deals of more than $1 million. So exciting. Nine of the top 10 deals included six or more clouds. Think about that. Nine out of our top ten deals included six or more clouds.\nSo, you know that we have amazing clouds: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, platform or Commerce Cloud, Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, but think about it, how they're bringing all those things together. Data Cloud, they're bringing it all together into a cocktail. That's amazing. And by the way, those cocktails are going to be Christmas cocktails soon. In Q3, we once again showed our commitment to increasing our margins. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year over year, following an increase of 1,000 basis points in the previous two quarters. It kind of is a sentence that you don't really expect to ever read as a CEO. That was kind of amazing.\nOperating cash flow for the Q3 was $1.5 billion, up 389% year over year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year over year. Percentages and absolute numbers are just mind blowing. Our remaining performance obligation ended the Q3 at $48.3 billion, which is an increase of, oh yeah, 21% year over year. Pretty good. Okay, now let's move on to guidance. Based on our performance, we're raising our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance in constant currency to $34.8 billion at the high end of the range, 11% projected growth year over year. Last quarter we raised our fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin to 30%.\nNow we're accelerating again, and we think that we're going to move this thing to 30.5% for the year. Amy, I think you better beat that. I mean, the acceleration on the margin this year has been pretty incredible, as we all know. If you go back and look at the last five quarters, you wouldn't believe it. I don't believe it. We delivered an improvement of 850 basis points year over year this quarter. Couldn't be more proud of our entire team, how well they are doing. We just got our employee surveys back.\nYou know, the team morale is super high, so cohesive, brought back so many boomerangs, really reinforced our culture during this year as well. That has been one of the major things that we have been doing, and we have really been focused on building this number one AI CRM, rebuilding our product strategy. Really focused on number two is getting these sales executives to be able to tell these stories of AI success. You know, and it is incredible to be able to exactly explain to a customer what they can do to be successful. You know, the third thing we are really focused on is this idea of delivering new products and new technologies, and you know, this UE+ product that we have now introduced in the market.\nTo see so many customers adopt that in the quarter, to see so much of it in our pipeline, UE+, and the incredible work of David Schmaier and his team has been just amazing there. Also, our professional services team delivering these great implementations and making sure our customers are successful. The fifth thing I would say we're focused on is this Ohana 2.0 culture, you know, which has really taken shape in the middle of this year and really now evidence in this. You probably saw we just became a great place to work again. We're on the top 10. We're now number seven. It's amazing to see that recognition for this company is so well deserved.\nSo, where are we? Well, you're seeing this high level of interest in Data Cloud and Einstein. It's incredible what's happened. I've been on the road pretty much nonstop, especially over the last month. I've been throughout Europe, I've been now in Asia, I've been throughout the United States, and I just continue to see these same trends, which is customers are investing for the future, and they're investing and inspired by AI to give them more productivity. Look, they realize unemployment is just so low. Where are they going to hire more people? It's so hard for them to hire.They're going to have to get more productivity from their employees.\nThey're going to do that through this great new technology, and we're going to help them make that happen. Data Cloud was part of six of our top 10 deals of the quarter. We had more than 1,000 net new customers for Data Cloud. I've talked a little bit about the number of deals, the number of wins, over a million dollars of Data Cloud doubled, and the average ARR per win more than tripled compared to last quarter. Pretty awesome. We've now created a self-service switch so that every EE and UE customer can just flip it on. Engineering has just done a great job letting every customer become a Data Cloud customer. Closed a lot of amazing deals in the quarter. Really excited about AWS.\nI know everyone has been talking about that, especially down at the conference this week at re:Invent, and we couldn't be more thrilled for our partnership with Andy Jassy. Really excited, really excited about our relationship with American Cancer Society. They've been a customer for a long time, doing incredible work. Now seeing them use the Data Cloud, becoming even more productive, more efficient. Group Global, 30 million users now using Data Cloud. SiriusXM.\nJoe Inzerillo, great executive. You know, we work so closely with him at Disney, and one of the reasons that Disney has become, you know, wall to wall Salesforce, and now that he's at SiriusXM, he's deployed a great, incredible deployment of Data Cloud. Actually, our whole product line, we're so excited to work with Joe. This is really, I think, going to continue on as we start to talk more about customers who are using Data Cloud. I was just in Houston. Had a great dinner down there with all of our customers. We had some phenomenal local country music performance at the Benros as well.\nThe Ortega family did a great job cooking for us. Their restaurants are probably our favorite when we get on the road. I'll tell you, Waste Management and Jim Fish, who I saw when I was in Houston, great executive, loved working with Jim. Here is a great company, North America's leading environmental sustainability solutions provider. I know most of the folks on the call are probably customers, and wow, they just have done an incredible implementation and now doing a great job implementing all the AI solutions as well. Well, there's a lot more to talk about there. We've got so much going on, and 8 March is going to be a big day for Salesforce.\nWe're going to turn 25 years old. It's hard to believe. At the same time, we've completely rebuilt the company and are so well positioned for the AI revolution, and we're lucky to have a great management team. We've got them sitting here at the table. Of course, you know, we've got Mike Spencer here who is doing a great job running FP&A and IR. We have Sebastian, our new Chief Legal Officer, Amy, our new CFO. Brian, why don't you take it from here and tell us what happened during the quarter.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, I really appreciate it, Marc, thank you so much. I'm very pleased with the quarter, and it's really a testament to our laser focus on operational excellence, high performance, and profitable growth initiatives. We're seeing the results of our full-scale transformation of our company in Q3. Our non-GAAP operating margin is up an amazing 850 basis points year over year, and we reduced GAAP sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue by 6 full points. We've matured our pricing and packaging to drive growth and simplify the buying experience.\nAs Marc said, we're well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth as we head into the largest quarter, our largest quarter, and into next fiscal year. Despite the continued measured buying environment, we grew revenues in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our product portfolio and multi-cloud transformational deals. In fact, the average size of our deals greater than a million dollars, as Marc said, was up 80% year over year, doubling our net new business in this segment.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we saw add-on products like sales performance management, digital service, and sales productivity grow ARR nearly 40% as customers look for quick time to value solutions and productivity gains. We saw traction with our new Salesforce starter offering, with nearly 1,000 new logos added this quarter, and as the number one AI CRM, companies in every industry and geography like Fujitsu, Southwest Airlines, and ANZ Bank are turning to us as their trusted advisor to help them transform their business for the AI future.\nWe're seeing amazing energy across our ecosystem with our partners, GSIs, and ISVs who are looking to build more opportunities with us around our AI offerings. We've established new partnerships with global management consulting companies like Bain & Company and McKinsey & Company. As Marc mentioned, we're expanding our existing relationship with AWS. It marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our global partnership with Amazon, deepening the integrations between AWS and Salesforce products.\nWe're bringing together the number one AI CRM and the leading public cloud provider to deliver an open, integrated data and AI platform to make it easy to find, buy, and manage Salesforce products through the AWS Marketplace. Before I get into the product momentum, I want to share some operational highlights. We continue to effectively manage our expenses, as you've seen and as is reflected in our improved non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 31% today. Our execution, inspection, and understanding of our customers' buying and approval process is better than ever.\nOur focus on high performance as a driver of growth is paying huge dividends. In Q3, we saw more than a 30% increase in AE productivity year over year. We're also refining and scaling our Big Deal motion, and further bundling products to drive higher sales and simplify the buying experience for our customers. We're doing all this while becoming more effective and efficient. I've been impressed with how quickly we've deployed our own trusted generative AI tools and applications internally.\nWe've launched Sales GPT and Slack Sales Elevate internally, and our global Support team is live with Service GPT, and we're seeing incredible results. We streamline our quoting process with automation, eliminating over 200,000 manual approvals so far this year. Since the introduction in September, our AI-driven chatbot has autonomously resolved fast thousands of employee-related queries without the need for human involvement.\nWe're seeing great success with our products, and so are our customers, which is clearly reflected in the high-level engagements and participation we're seeing in our events. In addition to Dreamforce, where we hosted 80% of our top customers for the quarter, we also held an amazing 450 customer events in our offices with nearly $2 billion in pipeline. As we close out the year, we have a New York City World Tour coming up on 14 December. I hope you all can join us in person. If you can't, we hope you join us on Salesforce+.\nWe can continue to hire selectively across key growth areas, especially in Data Cloud and AI, and we've seen the highest demand to join Salesforce in our history, with the largest volume of applications in any quarter ever. Our growth initiatives across our core products, data, AI, industries, and international drove our strong performance in the quarter, and as Marc outlined, we're seeing strong momentum in Data Cloud and Einstein. Importantly, we're already seeing high demand for our new premium UE+ bundle as customers recognize the value of our integrated solutions with Einstein AI functionality and Data Cloud built in, and our existing customers increased their spend with us by more than 70% when they upgraded to UE+.\nIndustry Clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, chosen by customers like Humana, US Agency for International Development, and RBC Wealth Management US for the first time this quarter. Nine of 13 Industry Clouds grew ARR above 50%. We're seeing continued MuleSoft growth, which was in eight of our top 10 deals this quarter and delivered an amazing 140 billion automated flows, up 142% year over year. Tableau, which is fully integrated to the Data Cloud, continues to help customers like Rubrik, Panera Bread, and US Navy see and understand their data and make data-driven decisions.\nIn the quarter, we did continue to see the macro trends affect our business, in particular our professional services business, our create and close sales motion, and our Slack self service business. Despite those headwinds, Slack was included in seven of our top 10 deals. Every day this quarter, there were 700 million Slack messages sent, and 2.75 million workflows ran on the Slack platform. We recently announced Denise Dresser as the new CEO of Slack, and I've had the chance to work with Denise for a dozen years and could not be more thrilled for her, and importantly, for the Slack business. Before I hand it off to Amy, I want to share some key number highlights on how we deliver for our customers during Cyber Week.\nCommerce Cloud powered nearly 50 million orders on digital storefronts across Cyber Week with 100% uptime, Einstein powered more than 49 billion product recommendations, and over 53 billion marketing messages were sent via the Marketing Cloud. In addition, Service Cloud helped our customers field and resolve 3.7 billion cases. This clearly demonstrates the scale and reliability of our number one AI CRM platform.\nIn closing, we're heading into Q4 with a ton of energy and ambition, guiding our customers through a new innovation cycle with an unwavering commitment to their success. I, like Marc, am extremely proud of the team with the changes that we've made not just in Q3 but over the last year. As I said earlier, we're well positioned for Q4 and as we head into fiscal year 2025, and with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. Q3 represents another strong quarter of strong execution and discipline. As you heard from both Marc and Brian, we've transformed the company over the past 12 months to drive consistent, profitable growth, and we are pioneering the next wave of innovation with data, AI, CRM, and trust. Now let's get right to the results.\nFor the Q3, revenue was $8.7 billion, 11% year over year, and 10% in constant currency. This represents a $40 million beat in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum, and resilient sales and service performance. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA grew 14%, or 10% in constant currency, and APAC grew 18%, or 21% in constant currency.\nWe saw strong new business growth in India, Brazil, and Japan, while parts of EMEA were more constrained from an industry perspective. Public sector performed very well, while high tech in general continues to be more measured. As Brian mentioned, our multi-cloud momentum continues. In Q3, nine of our top 10 deals included six or more clouds.\nQ3 revenue attrition remained strong and ended the quarter again at approximately 8%. In Q3, our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, up 850 basis points year over year. Our strong margin outperformance was driven by our continued disciplined investment strategy. Q3 operating cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 389% year over year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 1,088% year over year. This upside in cash flow was driven primarily by strong collections, as well as lower cash outflows as a result of the higher margins just discussed.\nNow turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $48.3 billion, up 21% year over year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $23.9 billion, up 14% year over year and 13% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by strong early renewal performance, as well as a large customer win in the quarter. This was partially offset by a 1 point headwind from Professional Services that we had cautioned about last quarter.\nFinally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment. In Q3, we returned another $1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases, and to date we have exceeded our initial authorization of $10 billion in just over five quarters. Before moving to guidance, I want to reiterate that we continue to assume a consistent, measured customer buying environment.Let's start with full year fiscal year 2024. On revenue, we are narrowing our guidance range to $34.75 to 34.8 billion, representing 11% growth year over year in nominal. We are now expecting a $50 million FX headwind, which implies a modest raise in constant currency.\nOn margins, we have made incredible progress on profitability and productivity this year. For fiscal year 2024, we are very pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance again to 30.5%, representing an 800 basis point improvement year over year. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation, which is now expected to be approximately 8% as a percent of revenue. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.99 to $4.00, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $0.91. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.18 to $8.19.\nWe are raising our fiscal year 2024 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 30% to 33%, and this continues to include a 14% to 16% point headwind from restructuring. The upside in our cash flow guidance is driven by strong collections to date, and our continued expense discipline. Capex for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 33% to 36% for the fiscal year, and as we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year 2024.\nIn fact, as a result of our ongoing share repurchases, for the first time in company history, we expect the full year's ending share count to decrease year over year. Now to guidance for Q4 on revenue, we expect $9.18 to 9.23 billion, growth of 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be 10% year over year in nominal and 11% in constant currency. Similar to this past quarter, we expect professional services headwinds of 1 point to CRPO growth.\nFor Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.27 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.26. As we look forward to our largest quarter of the year, we remain focused on strong execution and our disciplined investment strategy. In closing, I want to echo both Marc and Brian. This was a great quarter, but even more than that, this has been an extraordinary year of transformation. I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I particularly want to thank our employees for their incredible work throughout the past year. Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy. Operator, we'll move to questions now. Out of courtesy for others on the call, we ask that each person participating only ask one question, and with that, operator, we'll take the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much, and congrats on a nice quarter in a tough market environment. I don't know if Marc or Brian wants to take this, but MuleSoft growth against a pretty tough comp really does stand out a little bit in this quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about if we should view that as a harbinger of more interest in the broader Data Cloud offering, and whether the interest in MuleSoft is also sort of a harbinger of just more interest in AI as people try to get their data states in order to get ready for this coming AI wave. Thanks.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI'm going to have Brian really give you the detail, but what I'll tell you is you're seeing something that we have been seeing and call out for the last few quarters. We probably have not been able to illuminate it to the level that you see now in the numbers, which is that every customer and every customer transformation, and every customer AI transformation, is going to begin and end with data. For us to achieve that goal, those customers are going to have to get to another level of excellence with their data. At the heart and soul of that, for many of these customers, it's becoming MuleSoft.\nIn addition to Einstein, in addition to Data Cloud, in addition to our Copilot technology that we called out, it's been a lot about MuleSoft this year, and we think that trend is going to continue and is very exciting, and that we're very well positioned with this completely unique product that is helping our customers bring all their data together for the AI transformation.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nKirk, thanks for the question. I think you nailed it. It's exactly what's happening out there. That data is becoming such an important asset for our customers that they want to bring it all together, and they want to leverage our MuleSoft technology to do it. It's really an exciting opportunity. As we stated, it was eight of our 10 top deals in the quarter. You can see the amount of data flowing through MuleSoft as an indicator for how important the data is, 142% up year over year on automated flows on the platform.\nI'd be remiss if I also didn't call out the leader there, Eric Eyken-Sluyters, who's done an incredible job in leading the sales organization as well. I think you nailed it in your question. This is a really important, critical product for us and for our customers as we think about scaling into the future.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kirk. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo, your line might be on mute.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOh, sorry, sorry. Never learned that. Congrats for me as well. Brian, you talked about sales productivity, and that was a big theme this year. The 30% increase is very impressive. Where are we on that journey in terms of, like, first of all, how did you achieve that? Because that's a very big number in the software industry. Where are we on that journey in terms of going forward? Thank you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks for the question. Obviously a big focus for us. We've talked about it on previous calls with all of you. It's a never ending journey, obviously, and we want to continue to drive productivity for our account executives. We talked about a very large deal in the quarter that helped drive that productivity. All in, we saw a very nice increase in our productivity. Really focused on a couple things. One, we've leaned in enablement for all of our sellers out there to ensure that they really understand this broad portfolio of products and are able to go out and talk to our customers about it, deeply understanding our buying process. You know, this was some of an area early in the.\nMaybe last year where we stumbled a bit not understanding the buying process of our customers. Deep inspection of our business, both pipelines and cycles that we're in and driving, really being oriented to value as we talk to our customers about the solutions that we can provide to them. What is the ROI our customers going to see from the investments they're making in Salesforce? Ensuring that we really understand that before we put proposals in front of them.\nFinally, I think there's, you know, couldn't be prouder of the inspection that we're getting across the board. We have a new sales leader in Miguel Milano, who's brought a new discipline to the way that we're looking at the pipelines, not only in the existing quarters, but in future quarters going forward. The discipline that we've driven across the board is driving these great results from a productivity perspective at the AE front. Thank you for the question.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Ronald. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Very nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the 17% of the Fortune 500 that are the Einstein GPT Copilot customers. Really impressive figure, really early in the technology cycle because a lot of what we're hearing is a lot of exploration out there, a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with these tools, not a lot of buying.\nCan you give us a little bit of color on kind of what's driving that adoption and what's enabled you guys to get such good adoption so quickly? Maybe if I could sneak one in for Amy as well. Great margin expansion this year, but there's a lot of stuff you guys need to be investing against with this technology cycle. Should we expect to see further margin expansion as we head into FY25? Thank you, guys.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. You want me to take this first?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, why don't you take this?\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nOkay. Keith. Always looking for that margin expansion. Always looking for a little bit more guidance, but really happy to address this. We've had fantastic margin expansion this year. I mean, up 800 basis points for the end of the year. If I look back over the last three years, we have gone from 17.7% three years ago to it will be ending this year over 30% on operating margin, which I am just thrilled about. I think that we do have some room here, you know, as I've said before, we view this as a floor, not a ceiling on our success. We intend to continue our focus on operating margin in terms of investments. You know, it's all a matter of priorities.\nWe cut deeply earlier this year, and we've really been using that to invest into the areas of the business that we see as most truly strategic going forward. We've been very disciplined, especially around headcount as we've been doing that. Right now, I really see areas of investment in AI, in data, cloud, and in distribution. We're looking at real success stories like MuleSoft and doubling down. We're also being very careful on how we do that.\nWe are questioning levels, we are questioning locations, and we're making sure that we're maximizing really high speed, lower cost locations as well. I feel like we've got the room to do this, and we have the opportunities to invest into our future as well as to manage our margin very efficiently.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, I'll just add a little bit there too, Amy. I think we have really had a keen focus on the margin expansion. You know, we want to continue to simplify our go to market strategies. How do we optimize our pricing and packaging going forward as well? We talked about some of the things that we're doing there, new channels to market. We're really excited about the AWS marketplace as a new channel to market for us. Amy mentioned location strategies. How do we continue to look at our real estate portfolio as an opportunity? How do we leverage our own technology, Salesforce on Salesforce, and using our own products to drive more efficiency and automation in our business. Lots of opportunity to continue to do this.\nI'm excited about the culture and structural change in the way that we're thinking about margin expansion, and I think you'll continue to see that. Thank you, Keith. On the Fortune 500 that are using it, you're right, it is early days. As we said in the script, a lot of our customers are starting to trial and use this technology to see the benefits around productivity and cost takeout, leveraging the technology. As we've also said, the data is an important aspect of this and how do they clean up and harmonize their data first before they start to roll out these AI technologies broadly? How do you trust the output that you're getting from your AI investments?\nWhat we found in conversations with our customers is an energy around, an excitement around AI, but a need to clean up the data first before they can really take advantage of this, and we'll continue to see the expansion. The 17% is great. We want to continue to go faster there, and we're going to work with our customers to go drive those outcomes.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you and congrats on an amazing performance, Marc. Part of the story of 2023 has been optimizations weighing on hyperscaler spend, and then greater scrutiny on seat-based SaaS licenses. We are now starting to hear from hyperscalers that the optimizations are attenuating. Do you sense that shift in mentality spilling over a little into the thought process, for example, for Sales Cloud seats, or perhaps some excitement sparked by Sales GPT and freeing up some budget there on GenAI that maybe wasn't there six months ago?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nI think your number one thing that you're going to see is customers trying to achieve more productivity. This AI revolution is a productivity revolution, and it means that every customer is just a lot more augmented. You know, when I was in Tokyo, obviously the yen is very depressed, and of course we see that in our financial results as well. They'd be so much higher if the yen was higher. I had an opportunity to walk into a couple of our customers' retail stores, and one of them that I was extremely impressed with was Louis Vuitton. You know, when I walked into Louis Vuitton, they know exactly who I am. They have even in Tokyo.\nI test this wherever I go in the world. Lots of different customers. I had an incredible experience. They use this amazing app that they built with our platform called ICON. They've done an incredible job. They have my full customer data and buying history. The sales executives are guided on how to work with me, what kind of products I'm interested in, and what I want to buy. It's a productivity revolution for them. They are able to get a lot more success with our technology.\nI walked into another store, which is not one of our customers, and I have to follow up still with the CEO because, wow, the customer experience was just horrible. It was the exact opposite. They didn't know anything about me. They couldn't work with me at all. It took probably the salesperson three, four, or five times as long to complete the transaction because they did not have the automation.\nThe productivity revolution had not come to this company. When I look at the companies that have had that great success, obviously the entire Louis Vuitton group, obviously the entire Kering group.\nYou know, when I look at so many of the organizations that I had the opportunity to kind of touch, it's been amazing. I guess I was also very inspired in Japan talking to Goto-san, who's the CEO of Seibu. He has an incredible hotel chain called Prince Hotels. You know, they're building a whole next generation loyalty system based on Salesforce. They've had great success in using our product for marketing their hotels and having much higher levels of customer touch both in B2B and B2C. Now they can take it to another level with the Data Cloud and provide a high level loyalty management point system, something that's so important for their future growth.\nI had another opportunity to talk to Tomoyama-san, who is the head of technology at Toyota. His point was very simple. We've fully automated all of the Toyota dealers in Japan. It's been an incredible success story. We have done that with Toyota Media Service as our partner, a company that we have a high, incredible relationship with. Now with Toyota, we have the ability to.\nTake our vision to a whole other level, making this connected car experience really go one step higher. Connecting all the Toyota cars directly to our Data Cloud and the Data Cloud, then having the ability to proactively deliver the customer information and interactivity as it hits different thresholds. These are the opportunities that I see going forward. It's about productivity, it's about automation, it's about doing it on a global basis. For these companies, and ultimately for them, it's about taking advantage of this incredible new artificial intelligence technology that before was not possible.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nYou know, Marc, if I could weigh in there as well. I think Marc stated well, companies are still really focused right now in this environment on productivity, on automation, on time to value. You certainly see it from the CFOs, my counterparts around the world, real focus on every dollar that's being spent. We're now entering our sixth quarter of measured customer buying behavior, and we're seeing that this has been continuing recently, and that does reflect particularly in areas like SMB, self serve, create and close. You see this in particular professional services. Well, I'm also really excited about what we're seeing in terms of how we can step in and really help our customers get to their goals. Brian, I don't know if you have anything for that.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThat's great. I mean, exactly what I was going to say. A lot of demand at the top of the funnel for us, for new technologies like Data Cloud and like AI, but also seeing some headwinds, no doubt from our more transactional business as you stated. Mark, thank you for the question.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take next question now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nMarc, really nice improvement in deals over a million, up 80% year over year. You've all alluded to this larger contract you landed. I'm just curious, do you feel like this is a new environment? Do you feel this is Miguel and the team, you know, having better gel in the field? What are you, any more color there? If you could talk to on the bigger deal front, would be helpful.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "There's a lot of debate on the management team putting together this call and how we're going to answer that question. We don't want to in any way give you indications that we see this environment going behind us. That said, we see a lot of green shoots. There's just a lot of opportunities customers are excited about. You know, I think Japan, I would say, is very much a metaphor for me. When I was there about a year ago, for them, it was still the pandemic. You know, everyone, when I had lunch with my employees, they had to wear masks a year ago.\nThis was the first time when I felt like, oh, kind of back to normal. The pandemic hangover is kind of ingested by the customers. I think that we're cautious about saying, oh, it's all green shoot. Everything's going. We're back to normal at the same level. You know, we are honest with you that we have a lot of green shoots in products, in geographies, and you can see in this growth rate and large deals. We are excited. I do not think we are willing to say to you on the call, hey, we have turned the corner.\nWe want to, but we are not sure because for a lot of customers, they still are measured in their buying environments. You know that you talk to these customers, you talk to the channel partners, they are somewhat measured in their buying environments. I would say people are a lot less measured than they were, is one way to put it. There is definitely reduction in the measured buying environments on a global basis. Like I said, in some of these customers and in the last 30 days, I was in, you know, I can give you my, you know, direct experience. You know, I was in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Stuttgart, Germany, I was in Nice, Monaco. I visited with our, with our customers.\nThroughout that area, I went up to Amsterdam, to France. I had a large customer dinner in the UK, and in London went to the UK Safety Summit. I then came back and went to Japan. I think I see something very consistently, which is customers are extremely excited about AI everywhere we go. It could be government, it could be commercial organizations, it could be technologists. Everyone's excited about AI. At the same time, there is a lot of confusion about what AI can and cannot do. I think that's a huge opportunity for us to tell stories to our customers of what the success opportunities are in the enterprise with AI, and also what the reality is for a lot of these customers.\nYou know, when I mentioned I was in Las Vegas, you know, when I showed up in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, you know, the customers are. They have our product in their hands, welcoming me. You know, the whole team comes out because they're so excited because they use Salesforce. It's, you know, very flattering. When I got to Disneyland in Anaheim, which is something I've done four times this year, and obviously they become also one of our very largest customers in the world. Every Disney Guide, and if you use Disney Guides, which is a product I highly recommend at all the Disneylands, in Disney Tokyo on Monday and in Disney Anaheim talking to the Disney Guides, and they use Salesforce and Slack to make those tours happen.\nThey use Salesforce call center now for Disney+. On the Disney Store, you know, is Commerce Cloud. It's an incredible success story, but it's a huge opportunity for them to take another level at Disney, where I certainly can see how all that information can get translated into AI, and that when I walk in the park, I'm expecting the Mandalorian soon to come up to me and say, hey, what'd you think of the episode last night? It hasn't happened yet. I think we're all kind of on the cusp of delivering that full customer 360 for Disney.\nI think Bob Iger has been doing an incredible job, and his vision for the future of the company with AI Assist, you know, extraordinary. I can kind of go customer by customer, story by story. This excitement, this energy, these ideas of innovation, of AI were not in place a year ago because, don't forget, a year ago, I don't think any of us had used ChatGPT, Bard, Anthropic, Cohere, Adept, or any of the new AI companies. None of us had really had our hands on or envisioned what it really meant to us, or that we would have copilots, and those copilots would give us this ability to do all kinds of next generation capabilities.\nA year later, it's a technology revolution, and we just want to make sure it's a trust revolution. We want to make sure it's about an AI, CRM, and data revolution. I think we hit it right with the Data Cloud we have. We still have a lot of work, as everyone does in our industry, on AI and making it safe for our customers. This is going to be incredibly important, I think, for a lot of customers. They realize that they'd like to just let this AI unleashed autonomously, but it still hallucinates a huge amount, and it also is quite toxic. We're not quite ready for that revolution. Every day it's getting a little better.\nWhen I am going through the streets of Tokyo, it's not quite the Minority Report, which is a movie that was partly written by our futurist Peter Schwartz, but it's getting closer to that idea. When I walked into some of these stores, there's definitely a lot more automation based on my customer record, but not quite the level of automation that Tom Cruise felt when he walked into that Gap store. If you remember that scene, which was so amazing, which is very much front of mind for a lot of our customers because they want to have that capability, and they want us to deliver that for them.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to Amy and Brian. Salesforce obviously made a fairly significant pricing change early in the fourth quarter. Maybe Brian, I'd love to get some color on the receptivity. Amy, in particular, is there a way you might frame the extent to which that price change may have impacted the guidance for 11% constant currency in the fourth quarter? Also, was that perhaps one of the drivers for the early renewals that you saw in Q3 as some customers maybe wanted to get in front of it. Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nHey, Carl, thanks for the question. Appreciate it. The price increase has landed as well as a price increase. I guess with our customers out there, I think when we're delivering value to our customers and they're seeing benefits from our technology, we feel good about our ability to go execute against this. It's still early, honestly. We just introduced this a few months ago, and we have seen certainly some benefits from it, but we'll see these benefits roll in over the next really three years as these contracts come up for renewal. Yes, there's been receptivity to it, but the big impacts will be seen over the next three years. We're not going to see it in the near term, honestly, in our numbers. Amy, any comments?\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brian. Brian pretty much summed it up. As we mentioned last quarter, we do not anticipate a material impact from pricing in the guide this year. That said, I have been very pleased by the execution and the discipline that we're showing around rolling this out. An uplift really needs to roll for the full renewal install base, which is going to take some time.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Carl. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nWonderful. Thanks so much. Great to see all the success here with Data Cloud. I'm not surprised we're hearing that from the channel. My question is really around the organization, the team that's responsible for executing on this, and how they plug into the different product groups. You know, data scientists in this day and age are a rare commodity, and you clearly are attracting that. So we'd love to get a sense for that organization, how it's evolved, and how well integrated they are across the different product groups. Thank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think that that is very much primary focus of the company, which is that, you know, when we started this Data Cloud, we thought we were just building a CDP, you know, and CDP looked like an exciting market opportunity. We're number one in, you know, enterprise marketing automation. That seems like a great opportunity. The more we started working on this product, we realized, oh, every one of our clouds needs this Data Cloud. Sales Cloud needs a Data Cloud. Service Cloud needs a Data Cloud. Yes, Marketing Cloud needs a Data Cloud. Call that CDP. Slack needs a Data Cloud. Tableau also needs a Data Cloud.\nIf you've seen any of my recent demonstrations and with these great Tableau customers in Japan, they all, you know, need a Data Cloud on the back end of Tableau. This idea that the Data Cloud will become the heart and soul of the product, be the engine of all of Salesforce's apps. You know, you can use our models, our AI models, or you can bring your own models into the Data Cloud, which is a very cool feature. This idea that it also has this incredible level of capability, but the amount of data that it's already managing and the amount of data that it's already ingested, that is what is shocking to us.\nI think that you're going to see as we get deeper and deeper into this. You can really see the level of data that we're handling, the trillions and trillions of transactions. This is going to be the key to the AI working for enterprises. Enterprises are going to want to deploy AI for productivity. I think I've made that case already on the call. They're going to get frustrated when the copilots that they are given from other companies don't have any data. They just have data grounded to maybe the application that's sitting in front of them. It doesn't have a normalized data framework integrated into the copilot.\nWhile I think copilot on productivity applications are exciting because you can tap into these kinds of broad consumer databases that we've been using, as an example, the copilot is, I'm writing an email. So, now I'm saying to the copilot, hey, now can you rewrite this email for me or make this 50% shorter or put it into the words of William Shakespeare? You know, that's all possible. Sometimes it's a cool party trick. It's a whole different situation when we say, I want to write an email to this customer about their contract renewal, and I want to write this email that really references the huge value that they received from our product and their login rates.\nI also want to emphasize, you know, how the success of all the agreements that we have signed with them have impacted them and that we're able to provide this rich data to the copilot and through the prompt and the prompt engineering that is able to deliver tremendous value back to the customer. This customer value will only be provided by companies who have the data. We are just very fortunate to be a company with a lot of data, and we're getting a lot more data than we've ever had.\nA lot of that is coming from the Data Cloud because it's amplifying the capabilities of all the other data we have. It's a very interesting moment for Salesforce. I think the demonstrations at Dreamforce were outstanding. The demonstrations that we'll deliver in our February release will be mind boggling for our customers, of what they will be able to get done. I think that by the time we get to Dreamforce 2024 in September 2024, what we'll see is nothing that we could have possibly imagined just 24 months earlier before.\nThese breakthroughs in generative AI have really taken hold through the whole industry. No one company has a hold on this. I think it's pretty clear at this point that because of the way AI is built through open source, these models are very much commodity models, and these responses are very much commodity responses. We've always felt that way about AI. For more than a decade, we've said that its growth has really been amplified by open source development because these open-source models now are as strong as commercial models or proprietary models.\nI think that what we really can see is that is going to accelerate this through every customer. There's not going to be any kind of restrictions because of the proprietariness or the cost structures of these models. We're going to see this go much faster than any other technology. The reference point I've been using as I travel around is really mobile operating systems. Mobile operating systems are very important, and we all have one on our desk or in our pocket right now. Really, the development of mobile operating systems has been quite constrained because they're held mostly by two companies and two sets of engineering teams.\nThat's not how this technology is being built. This technology is highly federated across thousands of companies and thousands of engineering teams who are sharing this technology. Because of that, you're ending up with a rate of innovation unlike anything we've seen in the history of our industry, and it is moving us into areas very quickly that could become uncomfortable. This is an exciting moment.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brad. With that, we'll conclude the call. We appreciate everyone joining the call, and wish everyone a happy holiday season. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks everybody.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nBye everyone. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question again, press the star one. Thank you. I would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our Fiscal 2024 Q2 Results Conference Call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures.\nReconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which could change should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect. Actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements and with that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAll right. Hey, thanks so much, Mike, and really appreciate everyone being here today. We're obviously very excited about these results and getting out there with all of you and thanks for being on this call. So listen, as we've shared with you over the last couple of earnings calls, Salesforce has really accelerated our transformation to profitable growth.\nI think that's super clear from the numbers, and I couldn't be more excited, especially on this huge top line beat and what our margin is looking like today. You know, as you all know, over last year we've been executing against these four key areas of our transformation. First, our restructuring for the short and long term.\nWe've been talking about that since the Q4 call, and we're going to update you on that today. Second, we're reigniting our performance culture by focusing on productivity, operational excellence, and profitability, and Brian is going to talk about that today. And third, we're prioritizing the core innovations that drive customer success. And I can't wait to share with you at Dreamforce how we're taking our core platform to a whole new level.\nShowing you some incredible new enhancements to our Data Cloud as well as new versions of Einstein, and also fundamental extensions to our core platform. Really showing how our core platform has been rebuilt so that we can take so many of these amazing acquisitions that we've made over the last decade and run them right inside the core. Our fourth priority is building even stronger relationships with our investors. That's all you. You know how important that is to us.\nWe probably spent more time in the last six or nine months with our investors than we have maybe in the entire history of the company. We've received just great feedback from all of you, and we're really making great progress there. I want to especially thank Mike for everything that he's doing with all of you. We're adding a fifth priority. And last quarter we told you, we're now driving our AI transformation. We're pioneering AI for both our customers and ourselves, leading the industry through this incredible new innovation cycle.\nI couldn't be happier with Srini, David, and the entire product and technology team for the incredible velocity of AI products that were released to customers this quarter and the huge impact that they're making in the market and showing how Salesforce is transforming from being not only the number one CRM but to the number one AI CRM. I've just expressed my sincere gratitude to our entire product and engineering team.\nI couldn't be happier. The performance of our team delivered in the Q2 , the numbers basically speak for themselves. Our AI, Data Cloud, CRM plus Trust platform, well, it's propelled us to become the third largest enterprise software company by revenue in the world. I think in Japan we just became the second largest company. Congratulations to everyone at Salesforce and especially to our Japanese team. With our industry-leading clouds and Sales, Service, Marketing, Commerce, our industry clouds powered by Data Cloud, Einstein, Flow, Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, really all of these are integrated into one trusted metadata-driven platform.\nWe're providing more capabilities to more customers than any other CRM vendor. Can't wait to show all that. As I said at Dreamforce, that's why Salesforce is the number one CRM by market share based on the latest IDC software tracker. Now we are working hard to be the number one. As I said, AI CRM, our transformation drove our Q2 results, especially when it comes to our highest priorities. You can see profitability. You know, look, we couldn't be happier to see these numbers.\nIt's incredible to see the margin acceleration in such a short period of time. We've exceeded our own expectations. I hope we've exceeded yours. In our Q2, our non-GAAP operating margin rose to 31.6%. That's up over 1,000 basis points year-over-year. And this is the Q2 in a row, our operating margin is up 1,000 or more points year-over-year. And as you're about to hear from Amy, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost management while also investing in growth initiatives across our entire platform of offerings. And we're positioning Salesforce for the future and will continue to drive our margins.\nAnd also while we're continuing to drive customer growth, revenue in the Q2 was $8.6 billion. That's up 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. During the quarter, we had great wins with JPMorgan, Bayer, FedEx, Maersk, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs, and so many more you're going to hear about from Brian. Operating cash flow for Q2 was $808 million. Pretty incredible. That's up 142% year-over-year. Really very strong. Our remaining performance obligation ended the Q2 at $46.6 billion. That's an increase of 12% year-over-year. Really amazing.\nCurrent remaining performance obligation, or what we call CRPO, ended at $24.1 billion. That's up 12% year-over-year and 11% in constant currency. Now through the Q2, we have returned, and this is amazing, you know, $8 billion in share repurchases since we started the buyback program a year ago. So we've bought $8 billion of stock over the last 12 months. That is really awesome. Amy's going to talk more about that, and I think I know you realize we have a lot more to do there.\nBased on our performance and what we saw in the back half of the year, we're raising our fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $34.7 to 34.8 billion, or about 11% projected growth year-over-year. Last quarter, we raised our fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 28%. We said that we expected to eclipse 30% in the Q1 of fiscal 2025. Well, as you've all seen these numbers, and now I'm happy to officially share, we are accelerating that target again, raising our fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin 30%, an improvement of 750 basis points year-over-year. It's kind of amazing.\nBut yes, we are saying that we're going to deliver 30% margin for this year, and that's an incredible goal. So while we thought we were going to do it next year, we're really going to do it this year, and it's an amazing achievement of our whole team. It certainly has been a lot of work. It's been difficult. In a lot of cases, it has been a struggle. But our teams are incredible, and what they have done has been nothing short of miraculous and down to earth. Not only delivery of the 31% growth for this quarter, but now the 30% for the year. It's just awesome. It's just incredible. And I'm really excited to welcome back to Salesforce so many boomerang employees.\nBoomerang employees are employees who were employees but for one reason or another left the company, got recruited away, or went off to start their own companies or whatever. Well, a lot of these results have to do with not only our incredible employees that we've had in place, but a lot of folks have really felt the desire to come back and help us. I just want to say thank you to all of them. It's been incredible to welcome them back, and the line is long out the door. People who have left Salesforce and want to come back to Salesforce, and we're welcoming all of them with open arms, especially across our sales engineering, technology organization.\nProven winners, incredible leaders who got taken out of Salesforce because they were doing incredible things. To watch them come back because they want to help us and achieve this next level of growth and capability and revenue and margin and technology and leadership.\nWell, I just want to especially start to thank some of those, including Miguel Milano, who's our new Chief Revenue Officer, has just returned to us from Celonis. And of course Ariel Kelman, our Chief Marketing Officer, who's most recently at Oracle. And Kendall Collins, our Chief Business Officer, and has been my, now my chief of staff, and was of course had so many executive positions at Salesforce, but this is a long list, and I can't even continue it of how many people are coming back. And what I love about this is that they're hitting the ground running.\nThey make an immediate impact. They know the culture, they understand the products, they're able to execute, you know, incredible agility. And so got the siren song out there for all of them to come back and to join us now. Earlier this month we welcomed Sabastain Niles to Salesforce as our Chief Legal Officer. He's sitting here at the table right now making funny faces at me. And I wouldn't be happier, and I couldn't be happier to have Sabastain as part of my executive leadership team. We met Sabastain this year. We did a lot of work with Wachtell.\nAs a lot of you know, we won't go through the details. It's not necessarily go through that right now. The past is the past. But I'll tell you, one of the greatest things that happened during this amazing period of Salesforce was meeting Sabastain. And now to have him on the leadership team, I couldn't be more excited and I'm thrilled to have him with us. So welcome, Sabastain.\n\nSabastian Niles\n\nCLO, Salesforce\n\nThank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, thank you. Those are his opening comments. AI Data CRM Trust. Let me tell you, we are at the dawn of an AI revolution. And as I've said, it's a new innovation cycle that is sparking a massive tech buying cycle over the coming years. It's also a new tech investment cycle. We've been involved in the earliest rounds of many of the top AI startups.\nMany of you seen that we are in there very early. But I'll tell you, this company has pioneered AI not just in predictive. A lot of you have followed the development and growth of Einstein, but also you've seen that we've published some of the first papers on prompt engineering and the beginnings of generative AI. And we took our deep learning roots and we really demonstrated the potential for generative AI. And now to see so many of these companies become so successful,\nI just saw OpenAI delivering a $1 billion revenue run rate. It's just awesome to see this growth and especially proud that they're right here in our hometown of San Francisco, which is becoming the number one AI city in the world. Very excited for a city. Now, through our $500 million generative AI fund, we're seeing the development of ethical AI with amazing companies like Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, and so many others. And I just heard one of them just subleased our entire Slack building. But I'm not allowed to say who it is, but I couldn't be more excited about that because we're really seeing downtown San Francisco become AI central.\nSo every CEO I've met with this year across every industry believes that AI is essential to improving both their top and bottom line, but especially their productivity. You know, AI is just augmenting what we can do every single day. Just think about myself. I've spent so much time on Bard over the last week.\nIt's incredible. I was just buying some flashlights and I couldn't figure out what flashlight I wanted to buy. And I was on Amazon trying to figure out what's the flashlight. And so I took a picture of the Amazon picture of what was happening on the app, and I gave it to Bard because Bard has this multimodal capability to ingest the photo and ingested the photo. And it told me not to buy the flashlight, that it was poor quality, and it recommended one that was better for me.\nIt was incredible to see that I was once again working with a next generation of artificial intelligence. And that is inspiring me. And I think many of our customers, and ultimately all of them, believe they can grow their businesses by becoming more connected to their customers than ever before through AI and at the same time reduce costs, increase productivity, drive efficiency, and exceed customer expectations through AI. And I'll tell you, every single management team that we have here at Salesforce, every week, we're using our Einstein AI to do exactly the same thing. We go back, we're trying to augment ourselves using Einstein.\nSo we'll say is, and we've been doing this now and super impressive. We'll say, okay, Brian, what do you think our number is? And say, okay, that's very nice, Brian, but Einstein, what do you really think the number is? And then Einstein will say, I think Brian is sandbagging. And then the meeting continues. The reality is every company will undergo an AI transformation with the customer at the center, because every AI transformation begins and ends with the customer. And that's why Salesforce is really well positioned with the future and with this incredible technology, Einstein, that we've invested so much and grown and integrated into our core technology base.\nWe're democratizing generative AI, making it very easy for our customers to implement every job, every business, and every industry. And I will just say that in the last few months, we've injected a new layer of generative AI assistance across all of the Customer 360. And you can see it with our salespeople who are now using our Sales Cloud GPT, which has been incredible, what we've released, you know, this quarter to also all of our customers and here inside Salesforce. And then when we see that, you know, they all say to themselves, you know what? In this new world, everyone can now be an Einstein.\nBut democratizing generative AI at scale for the biggest brands in the world requires more than that, just these large language models and deep learning algorithms. And we all know that because a lot of our customers kind of think and they have tried and they go and they pull something off a Hugging Face. A Hugging Face is an amazing, amazing company. We just invested in their new round and grab a model and put some data in it and nothing happens.\nAnd then they don't understand, and they call us and say, hey, what's happening here? I thought that this AI was so amazing. And it's like, well, you know, it takes a lot to actually get this intelligence to occur. And that's what I think. That's, you know, the value that Salesforce is bringing is that we're really able to help our customers achieve this kind of technological superiority right out of the box, just using our products in a low code, no code way.\nIt's really this democratization of generative AI at scale, and that is really what we're trying to achieve. That at the heart of every one of these AI transformations becomes our intelligent, integrated, and incredible Salesforce platform. And we're going to show all of that at Dreamforce. Our platform starts and ends now with our Data Cloud. I just would like to call out the incredible Data Cloud team for what they've delivered.\nA lot of you have seen the release of the Data Cloud, this incredible Genie technology that we started really showing off last Dreamforce. But what you can see with Data Cloud is that customers must get their data together if they want to achieve success with AI. This is the critical first step for every single customer. We're going to see that this AI revolution is really a data revolution. You're going to see at Dreamforce that we're going to get this Data Cloud turned on as fast as we can and as easiest as we can for every single one of our customers. This Data Cloud is incredible, what it's doing for our customers.\nIt not only has AI built in, but it's real-time, it's automated, it's integrated with the core platform. It's not some separate Data Cloud. It's an integrated part of our platform in our metadata, in our core code, like our Sales Cloud, like our Service Cloud. And as you're about to soon see our new Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud, and of course our core application development capabilities, all inside our Data Cloud. No CRM platform on the planet is better positioned than Salesforce to use this amazing Salesforce and business data to fuel AI-powered applications. Because of this architecture, it's very easy for our customers to set up and just go.\nAnd our Data Cloud is so deeply integrated as part of this core metadata architecture. It's allowing our customers to quickly action all of their data from any source without the costly integration project necessary with standalone data warehouses and data lakes. They've been forced to buy and create more islands of information and all of these independent systems and independent teams versus having one integrated data architecture. We're moving our customers from having islands of data to having a single source of truth for all of their data.\nThis is our greatest dream. With Data Cloud and powerful technologies like Einstein, Flow, Lightning, Tableau, MuleSoft, Slack, our customers can easily supercharge every application and customer experience with AI automation and analytics at scale. Data Cloud continues to be our fastest growing organic product. You're going to see the new version at Dreamforce.\nIt's fully integrated with our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and, of course, already our Marketing Cloud and other key things. In this kind of new second version of Data Cloud that's coming, it will be fully released to the customers. And as I said, our goal is for every customer just to be able to easily turn it on. Just in Q2, Data Cloud ingested, and this is amazing, over 6 trillion records.\nIt ingested 6 trillion records and triggered more than 1 trillion activations to drive customer engagement. And we've always put trust at the center of everything that's going on in our platform. And that has never been more important, I would say, especially now, not only with Data Cloud, but in this AI revolution, because this AI revolution is a trust revolution.\nEverything Einstein does is also delivered with trust and especially ethics at the center. And I especially want to call out the incredible work of our Office of Ethical and Humane Use pioneering the use of ethics and technology. If you didn't read their incredible article in HBR this quarter, it was awesome and they are doing incredible work. Really saying that it's not just about AI, it's not just about data, but it's also about trust and ethics. And that's why we developed this Einstein Trust Layer.\nThis is completely unique in the industry. It enables our customers to maintain their data privacy, security, residency, and compliance goals. And I can tell you we're already at this early stage seen momentum with these amazing Einstein innovations. Companies like Heathrow Airport and PenFed Credit Union really adopted Einstein and took their Salesforce implementations to another level in the quarter. Heathrow is a great example of transformative power of AI data, CRM, and trust and the power of a single source of truth.\nThey have 70 million passengers who pass through their terminal annually. I'm sure many of you have been one of those passengers. I have as well. Heathrow is operating at tremendous scale managing the entire airport experience with the Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Commerce Cloud. But now, Heathrow, they've added Data Cloud also giving them a single source of truth for every customer interaction and setting them up to pioneer the AI revolution. And with Einstein, Heathrow service agents now have this AI-assisted generating replies to service inquiries, case deflection, writing case summaries, all the relevant data and business context coming from Data Cloud.\nWe're doing so much incredible and exciting innovative work in service with Data Cloud and with our Service Cloud. And AI is going to show us a whole new vision for the future of service and what our Service Cloud can do for customers. Not only with delivering high-quality customer service, but delivering incredible new levels of productivity. This is saving their agents huge amounts of time and effort. This is the power of Salesforce. I've never been more excited about the future of our industry, the power and future of our company, the potential to help all of our customers, and also especially our team.\nThe quality of our team especially fueled by all these amazing new boomerangs. You're going to see it all at Dreamforce. Dreamforce is right around the corner, 12 September through 14 September, right here in San Francisco. I'm looking forward to welcoming each and every one of you to Dreamforce. I'm right now at the top of Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. We're going to bring you up here; we'll bring you through Moscone. We'll show you our incredible downtown.\nI'll tell you, this isn't just the largest enterprise tech conference this year. It's going to be the world's largest AI conference and the largest gathering of AI experts. We'll have many of the world's top AI thinkers, including Sam Altman and his amazing OpenAI company. Incredible what he's doing. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who's one of his alumni who left OpenAI to start Anthropic. Amazing company. Stanford's Fei-Fei Li, amazing, amazing researcher and visionary leader of AI and presenting some of the 1,500 Dreamforce conference key sessions. It's really awesome what we're going to see here with AI and Dreamforce.\nWe're going to take everyone's skills to a whole nother level. We'll also share a vision for the future of CRM, the next generation of Data Cloud, and Einstein. We're also going to have the Foo Fighters. They're going to play our Dreamforce benefit concert. Dave Matthews is going to play my dinner the night before. Hopefully we're going to see him at the conference.In some incredible ways. We can't wait to get you all here and to show you what's happening in Salesforce, what's happening in AI, what's happening in San Francisco. It's going to be an amazing event and we're just a few days away. Now let me turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Marc, particularly for the sandbagging comment. I really appreciate.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWasn't me, it was Einstein.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nSorry. Yeah.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nSo just know it is what it is, Brian.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nGot it. Our focus on operational excellence.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThat's the AI revolution coming at you baby. So get ready. Okay.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nOur focus on operational excellence, high performance, and growth initiatives drove another strong quarter. We continued our disciplined approach to cost management and efficiencies, removing complexity from our business to drive top and bottom line improvements. Every customer I met within the quarter made it clear they are laser focused on driving greater productivity, quick time to value in business growth.\nWe see AI CRM as the answer. They all see AI CRM as the answer to those priorities. We're making it easier and faster for our customers to unleash the power of trusted generative AI safely and at scale. We're innovating faster than ever with AI+ Data + CRM+ the Trust platform. We also have the most complete product portfolio with Customer 360 delivering mission-critical outcomes for our customers.\nYou've heard from Marc. Data Cloud is supercharging our product portfolio, surfacing real-time customer data in the flow of work around Sales, Service, Marketing, and Commerce. That's why more than 90% of the Fortune 100 rely on Salesforce and average more than five of our clouds. Amid the ongoing measured buying environment, compression of larger transformational deals continued in the quarter affecting our professional services growth. Despite that we exceeded top- and bottom-line expectations in Q2.\nThis is a reflection of our proven go-to-market strategy and focus on customer success. Our high performance culture continues to drive results, and I'm proud of how well the team executed in the quarter. Our growth initiatives across core products, data, AI, services, industries, and international are driving our success in the quarter. We saw consistent demand in our core business, and we continue to benefit from customers consolidating their technology platforms to reduce complexity, drive efficiency, and growth. Six of our top 10 wins in the quarter included five or more clouds.\nAs you'll hear from Amy, we're deepening our relationships with multi-cloud customers who are running their businesses on Salesforce and realizing tremendous value from having one integrated AI-powered CRM platform. Schneider Electric has been using Customer 360 for over a decade, enhancing customer engagement, service, and efficiency. With Einstein, Schneider has refined demand generation, reduced close times by 30%. Through Salesforce Flow, they've automated order fulfillment, and with Service Cloud, they're handling over eight million support interactions annually, much of it done on our self-service offering.\nIn Q2, Schneider selected Marketing Cloud to further personalize the customer experience. In the quarter, we saw add-on products like sales, performance management, digital service, self-service, and marketing engagement grow 40%. And to help our smaller business customers achieve faster time to value, we introduced a new product called Salesforce Starter in Q2, bringing sales, service, and marketing into one integrated offering for our small business customers.\nAs Marc said, Data Cloud is one of our fastest growing organic innovations ever, and it lets customers unlock the power of their data to supercharge every application and customer experience with AI, automation, and analytics. This is driving our strong momentum. Data Cloud was in five of our top 10 deals in the quarter, and we saw great wins at companies like SiriusXM and KPMG in the quarter. FedEx made a significant investment in Salesforce by adding Data Cloud. FedEx has long relied on multiple clouds from Salesforce including Sales, Service, Marketing, and Einstein.\nNow with Data Cloud turned on, every part of Salesforce is deeply integrated to drive growth and deliver more targeted customer engagement and personalized experiences. We're also seeing strong customer momentum on Einstein generative AI. PenFed is a great example of how AI +Data +CRM +Trust is driving growth for our customers. PenFed is one of the largest credit unions in the US growing at a rate of the next nine credit unions combined.\nThey're already using Financial Services Cloud, Experience Cloud, and MuleSoft, and our Einstein-powered chatbot handling 40,000 customer service sessions per month. In fact, today PenFed resolves 20% of their cases on first contact with Einstein-powered chatbots, resulting in a 223% increase in chatbot activity in the past year. With incredible ROI in Q2, PenFed expanded with Data Cloud to unify all the customer data from its nearly 3 million members and increase their use of Einstein to roll out generative AI assistant for every single one of their service agents in the quarter. We also had great wins in Tableau, Slack, and MuleSoft.\nWith Tableau continuing to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in Q2, nearly half of our greater than $1 million-dollar deals included MuleSoft, and as customers bring together data from all sources to fuel efficiency growth and insights, MuleSoft has become mission critical for them and was included in half of our top 10 deals. We've seen excellent usage growth in our automation products including Slack, which has now launched nearly eight million workflows weekly, 71% increase year-over-year.\nOur industry verticals continue to be a growth lever for us, and for the third consecutive quarter, eight of our industry clouds grew at ARR above 50%. We also saw strong growth internationally with wins like Hargreaves Lansdown in EMEA, Department of Education Victoria, APAC, Banco Carrefour in LATAM.\nI'm excited to reiterate what Marc said earlier about Japan now being the second largest software business in the country. Just incredible growth. As we head into the second half of the year, we are leading the way as a number one AI CRM. With the pace of innovation at an all-time high, our focus on customer success drives our own success, accelerating revenue and profitability. The full power of Salesforce and our incredible community of trailblazers, experts, and partners will be on display at Dreamforce next month. I hope to see you all there. Amy, over to you.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nThank you, Brian. Our Q2 results show that we continue to make great progress in our four, now five key areas of transformation, delivering another quarter of top and bottom line expansion. As you can see in our results, we're delivering against our transformation driving profitable growth and shareholder value, and we are well positioned for the future with the number one AI CRM.\nOur execution against our profitable growth framework drove our Q2 results. So let's start with the top line commentary. For the Q2, revenue was $8.6 billion, up 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. The growth was primarily driven by continued MuleSoft momentum, solid sales and service performance, and a modest FX tailwind. This was partially offset by some continued weakness in professional services.\nThe durability of our business model and our continued multi-cloud expansion strategy reflects the mission-critical nature of our unified platform. This is evidenced by the more than 450 customers who invest more than $10 million annually and average seven clouds, and in the last five years the number of $10 million plus customers has tripled and their average number of clouds has nearly doubled.\nFrom a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 10%, EMEA grew 13% or 11% in constant currency, and APAC grew 20% or 24% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth internationally highlighted by Canada, France, and India, while the United States continued to be constrained. From an industry perspective, manufacturing, automotive, and energy saw greater resilience while high-tech, retail, and consumer goods were more measured. Q2 revenue attrition ended the quarter at approximately 8%.\nIn Q2, our non-GAAP operating margin rose to 31.6%, up 1,000 basis points or more for the Q2 in a row. The margin improvement was driven by savings from our restructuring actions, strength in revenue, and investment timing. I am very proud of our progress. Our disciplined approach to cost management has allowed us to exceed our 30% non-GAAP margin target 3/4 early.\nQ2 operating cash flow was $808 million, up 142% year-over-year. Q2 free cash flow was $628 million, up 379% year-over-year. The upside in cash flow was driven by stronger collections than expected and lower cash outflows tied to the Q2 margin benefits we just discussed.\nNow, turning to Remaining Performance Obligation. RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q2 at $46.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Current Remaining Performance Obligation or CRPO ended at $24.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 11% in constant currency. This was ahead of expectations, notably due to the momentum in MuleSoft. As we called out last quarter, CRPO growth did include a one-point headwind from professional services. And finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment.\nIn Q2 we returned 1.9 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total return to more than $8 billion, representing more than 48 million shares since the program was initiated just last August. Before turning to guidance, I wanted to briefly touch on the current macro environment as you heard from Brian. The measured macro environment continues to impact customer decision making, and we are still seeing elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers, and deal compression in our subscription and support, and professional services businesses. These factors are incorporated in our guidance.\nLet's start with fiscal year 2024. On revenue, we are raising our guidance to $34.7 billion to $34.8 billion, representing 11% growth year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. The increase is driven by strength in our subscription and support revenue, particularly in MuleSoft. We are accelerating our transformation to profitable growth. For fiscal year 2024, we are pleased to raise non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 30%, representing a 750 basis points improvement year-over-year.\nAs Mark highlighted, we're in a new AI era, a new innovation cycle that we will continue to invest into as we have over the last decade. As a result, we expect nonlinear quarterly margins in the back half of this year driven by investment timing, specifically in AI-focused R&D.\nWe also remain focused on stock-based compensation and expect it to improve this year to slightly above 8% as a percent of revenue. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.50 to 3.52 including estimated charges for the restructuring of $1.11. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be $8.04 to 8.06.\nWe are raising our fiscal year 2024 operating cash flow growth guidance to approximately 22% to 23%. This continues to include a 14 to 16 point headwind from restructuring. As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal year 2024 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses. We expect an even greater cash tax headwind next fiscal year as we draw down our remaining tax credit carry forward.\nCapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 24% to 25% for the fiscal year. Now, to guidance for Q3 on revenue, we expect $8.7 to 8.72 billion, growth of approximately 11% or 10% in constant currency.\nCRPO growth for Q3 is expected to be slightly above 11% year-over-year in nominal and slightly above 10% in constant currency. We continue to expect professional services headwinds of approximately 1.2% CRPO growth. As a reminder, Q3 is the first full quarter we lapped the measured buying environment that we first began to see in July last year. While we expect bookings growth to begin to normalize, CRPO will continue to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the previous five quarters of measured sales performance. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.02 to $1.03 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to $2.06.\nAs we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year 2024. In closing, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. As we laid out for you two quarters ago, we have radically accelerated our transformation to profitable growth.\nWe've maintained our disciplined approach to cost management while continuing to make strategic investments, notably in our new data and AI capabilities. And finally, I hope you're able to attend Dreamforce whether in person or virtually, to hear the latest on the incredible AI innovation our team is delivering. As Marc said, it's going to be the AI event of the year now. Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy. Now we'll move to the Q&A portion of our call. Now, out of respect for others on the call, we ask everyone to ask only one question. Emma, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nHead of Software Sector, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. The team has done a spectacular job doing a soft landing, not to use an overused term, [with respect to] the economy, [with] its cost controls, operating discipline, et cetera. So really congratulations on that, and I hope that Dreamforce continues to stay in San Francisco. Marc, a question for you is we got all this tremendous new product excitement. We've got generative AI capabilities. The spending environment seems to be sort of stabilizing. The economy does have a soft landing. Do you think Salesforce has maximized its customer wallet share or do you think there's more share to gain and therefore the better days ahead?\nBecause we've seen the margin story play out very, very impressively. Can Salesforce get back to the days of growth, not hyper growth, but is there enough room in the market, enough customer wallet share, and seemingly there's enough product excitement with generative AI? So if you net it all out, can we still do a nice job with margins while still having a shot at growing even faster when economic conditions are no longer a constraint? Thank you so much, and congratulations.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOh, Kash. Thanks so much. We're looking forward to seeing you at Dreamforce. We're really excited, and I think you're going to be super excited when you see these new AI products. And when we talk about growth, I think it's going to start with great AI. You know, I think that AI is about to really ignite a buying revolution. I think we've already started to see that with our customers and even some of these new companies like OpenAI. And we certainly see that in our customer base as well.\nI think you also know we've definitely seen in the last several quarters a measured buying environment. That's also been true, too, not just at Salesforce, but I think for the vast majority of our peers that you follow. And I think that you've also called that out a number of times. And I certainly expect that to abate, you know, especially as customers begin to adopt these new AI technologies and understand they need to invest and grow to be able to achieve this kind of next level of productivity.\nNow all that said, we've also seen this amazing growth in a number of our core technologies and our products. And I would especially like to call out the incredible success of MuleSoft over the last several quarters because that is a product that has far exceeded our expectations especially and including several of our geographies as well. So this is not something that is quite permeated everywhere, but there are some isolated areas, and I really think that Dreamforce is going to become a catalyst for our customers to see this opportunity to grow with us to see these new products, these new technologies.\nData Cloud is just one example of many new areas that Salesforce investments can happen with customers, and I'm sure that as they start to reignite their IT buying budgets in this kind of post-pandemic hangover that's kind of occurred, I think as we kind of get to this next level, we're going to see it driven by artificial intelligence intelligence. Brian, what's your perspective?\nYeah, Kash, thanks for the question. I think we've outlined in previous calls a growth strategy that's three pronged. One around expanding our multi cloud customers. And with new technology like AI and Data Cloud, there's a huge opportunity for us to go back to our customers and expand the number of clouds that they're using. A big growth opportunity to drive more value for our customers and certainly more success for us as well. Well, international acceleration continues a big opportunity for us, and we think there's plenty of room to run in the international markets.\nWe're going to continue to focus our efforts there and make investments as we see appropriate. Obviously we love to see the economy turn a bit. And then finally on industries, you heard me say eight of our industry clouds grew at greater than 50% in the quarter. It's remarkable the impact we're having with our industry products. Deeper investments in industries as well will continue to propel the growth of this business.\nI think I would be remiss if I didn't call on Ariel Kelman, who's sitting here at the table with us, to talk about Dreamforce and also talk about a number of the incredible new technologies that are appearing. So Ariel, can you give us a little bit of an insight to what we're going to see and some of these catalysts for amazing next level of growth for Salesforce that are going to occur?\n\nAriel Kelman\n\nPresident and CMO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, we're very excited about next week's Dreamforce conference. Hopefully all of you can join us. As Marc said, it's going to be the biggest AI event of the year. We have a tremendous lineup of speakers, both some of the most technical companies, the technical speakers of those companies, and people to help the broader business community understand what they can do with AI.\nAll across our Customer 360 range of products, we're going to have sessions for sales people, for marketing people, for customer service people to really teach them and inspire them on how they can use AI to really advance their capabilities with the technology we built directly in our product, in the flow of work, so they can take advantage of it immediately.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nAriel, you've been back now for what has it been, a couple months now? One month. How long has it been?\n\nAriel Kelman\n\nPresident and CMO, Salesforce\n\nIt has been since the beginning of June, so about three months.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nThree months. So tell us what's been your biggest surprise being back at Salesforce?\n\nAriel Kelman\n\nPresident and CMO, Salesforce\n\nMy biggest surprise is that the energy of all the people here is in some ways just as. Inspiring and energizing as it was when I was here 12 years ago. That this passion about the mission we're on and the high standards for the technology that we build is really, you know, has been very, very refreshing from having been at some other companies.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, we were sorry to lose you to Amazon and then to Oracle, but we're happy to have you back here, so welcome back.\n\nAriel Kelman\n\nPresident and CMO, Salesforce\n\nThank you.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nOkay, Mike.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Kash. Emma, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I echo Kash. Congratulations on a solid quarter, particularly on the margin side of the equation, where you guys really outperformed expectations. My question is around kind of margins on a go-forward basis. You achieved your targets well ahead of plan, three quarters ahead of plan, as you guys stated. But there's also a big opportunity ahead. Marc, you've talked a lot about this transformational opportunity ahead with generative AI.\nSo how should we be thinking about the balance between investing for that generative AI opportunity versus further kind of margin gains on a go-forward basis into the back half of this year and potentially into next year as you guys balance these two. Opportunities and goals?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I really would like to just directly address that, which is, you know, you're really speaking to is this incredible opportunity ahead. And generative AI is really that opportunity, but also many other opportunities, including data. I really think that there are some unbelievable opportunities ahead. It's going to be incredible to see what we're going to be able to do. And I think that the question is exactly as you said, how much are we going to really unleash the fundamental growth of a company against commitments that we have made to our investors to continue to deliver profitable growth.\nI think that at the very fundamental level, starting with our investor day last Dreamforce, we told you that we were committed to profitable growth and now you can see that we were serious. It wasn't a joke. We did a number of things, we curtailed things, we made changes structurally to the company, short term and long term issues.\nWe're still doing things, by the way, to do that. At the same time, we see this incredible opportunity that's out in the industry. New companies that are emerging, as well as, of course, all kinds of unusual public company dislocations. So we're watching all of those things. But number one is going to be our commitment to you. Nothing is more important than the trust that we have with our investors.\nNumber two is we are very thirsty to make sure that Salesforce is the number one AI CRM, and we have done a lot of organically to do that in the last six months. Of course there's things out there that we could do to help us with inorganic as well. We're looking at those things, we're looking at everything. But nothing is going to ever trump the trust that we have with all of you.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nKeith, I would just add when we did the restructuring, it was never just for the bottom line. We also made changes so that we would have the resources to invest into the areas that we believe are going to drive the highest growth for the company. And we've been very disciplined in our approach to spending this quarter.\nBut we want to lean into these opportunities, especially around AI, around data, and around our core. And as a result you will see that our increase in guidance to 30% does imply slightly nonlinear progression this year. And in terms of the future as we look forward, underscore everything Mark said about our commitments. And as I said last time, I really believe 30% annual is a floor, not a ceiling.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Keith. Emma, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYeah, thanks very much. I guess. Amy, I've had a lot of questions. Just on the impact of the pricing. Actions that you all announced earlier this year or over the summer. You know if that had any impact on the quarter and then,how are you thinking about that in terms of the guidance for the back half of this year? Thanks.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. So on guidance for this year, I have taken into account the pricing uplift as well. As for any changes from our new AI or opportunities around AI, I will say that neither has a significant influence on our guidance for this year. I think that those opportunities really take a while to roll through our customer base, particularly on pricing as we look to renewal. Brian, anything else you would like to add?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nNo, exactly. That we're going to see the impact of our price increase really hit the customer base over the next one to. Two to three years. So no big material change in this fiscal year. Appreciate the question, Kirk.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks Kirk. Emma, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nUS Software Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Maybe to Marc and/or Amy with headcount down 11% now and as you talked about, Marc, welcoming back former employees, do you feel like you've right-sized the headcount now at this 70,000 level? Has it sort of bottomed? And if you feel like there's an opportunity for it to stabilize or start growing again, is that a signal, Marc, that you feel like your growth rate here at 11% this year is at or near a bottom? Thanks so much.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce",
    "content2": "Well, I think it's such a great question and something the management team is talking about every single day because we are continuing to grow and invest in our headcount, especially in AI. Also, I think I mentioned we are doing so much incredible innovation work in our core, and we've commanded our engineering teams to accelerate their work in moving all of our acquisitions into our core, especially our marketing products, commerce products, and Data Cloud, all of which we plan to show you at Dreamforce and to accelerate that work. And that's extremely important to us.\nAnd also Brian has a number of products and geographies that are growing, and we've also commanded him to invest in his growth. So we are continuing to grow our headcount, but we are also facing normalized attrition, of course, with headcount. That's also part of it. And so as both of those things get rebalanced, you'll continue to see headcount adjust and move forward.\nI don't know if we can call this as a bottom exactly yet or if it's a bottom. But you know, we're not planning any other major restructuring efforts in the company today like what we saw earlier this year. We hope that that is one and done and behind us.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Karl. Emma, we'll take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Large Cap Enterprise Software, Bank of America Securities\n\nOh, wonderful. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask another question here on AI. The opportunities here are just so exciting. Across the stack, you know, with Sales GPT you've highlighted, you know, content automation, call summary, sales assistant, Service GPT auto replies, you know, summaries, and scheduling. Just when you look across the Salesforce stack, where do you see the most opportunity here? You know, across the Sales, Service, Marketing, Commerce in the core based on the activity that you're seeing today from customers with the early release of the product.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, thank you so much for that. You know, let me just say we're in the mid, we're at the beginning of, you know, quite a ball game here and you know, you know, we're really looking at the evolution of artificial intelligence in a broad way and you're really going to see it take place over four major zones. The first major zone is what's played out in last decade, which has been predictive. That's been amazing. That's why Salesforce will deliver about a trillion transactions on Einstein this week. It's incredible.\nThese are mostly predictive transactions. But we're moving rapidly into the second zone that we all know is generative AI and these GPT products which we've now released to our customers. We're very excited about the speed of our engineering organization, technology organization, and product organization and their ability to deliver customers customer value. With generative AI, we have tremendous AI expertise led by an incredible AI research team. And this idea that we're kind of now in a generative zone means that that's zone number two.\nBut as you're going to see, a dream for zone number three is opening up with autonomous and with agent-based systems as well. This will be another level of growth and another level of innovation that we haven't really seen unfold yet from a lot of companies. And that's an area that we are excited to do a lot of innovation, growth, and help our customers in all those areas. And then we're eventually going to move into AGI, and that will be the fourth area.\nAnd I think as we move through these four zones, CRM will become more important to our customers than ever before because you're going to be able to get more automation, more intelligence, more product productivity, more capabilities, and more augmentation of your employees as I mentioned. And you're right, you know, we're going to see a wide variety of case capabilities exactly like you said, whether it's the call summaries, account overviews, deal insights, insight summaries, and in-product assistance or mobile work briefings.\nI mean, when I look at things like service, you know, when we see the amount of case deflection we can do and productivity enhancement with our service teams, not just in replies and answers, but also in summaries and summarizations. We've seen how that works with generative and how important that is and knowledge generation and autoresponding conversations. And then we're going to have the ability for our customers with our product. We have an open system.\nWe're not dictating that they have to use any one of these AI systems. We have an ecosystem, of course; we have our own models and our own technology that we have given to our customers. But we're also investing in all these companies, and we plan to be able to offer them as opportunities for those customers as well. And they'll be able to deliver all kinds of things. And you'll see that whether it's going to end up being contract digitization and content generation, or survey generators, or all kinds of campaign assistance. And most recently in our World Tour in London, we showed how our Data Cloud did automatic marketing segmentation. That was incredible.\nAnd you're going to see a lot more that's going to happen in all these things. A lot of it you can see happening in Slack. Slack has become incredible for these AI companies. Every AI company that we've met with is a Slack company. All of them make their agents available for Slack first. We saw that, for example, with Anthropic where Claude really appeared first and Claude 2 first in Slack, and then Anthropic as a company uses Slack internally.\nThey take their technology and develop news digests every day and newsletters. And they do incredible things with Slack because Slack is just a treasure trove of information for artificial intelligence. And you'll see us deliver all kinds of new capabilities in Slack along these lines. We're working, as I've mentioned, get Slack to wake up and become more aware and also for Slack to be able to do all of the things that I just mentioned. One of the most exciting things I think you're going to see at Dreamforce is Slack very much as a vision for the front end of all of our core products.\nWe're going to show you an incredible new capability that we call Slack Sales Elevate, which is promoting our core Sales Cloud system running right inside Slack. That's going to be amazing. We're going to also see how we're going to release and deliver all of our core services in Salesforce through Slack. This is very important for our company to deliver Slack very much as a tremendous, tremendous, easy to use interface on the core Salesforce, but also all these AI systems.So all of that is that next generation of artificial intelligence capability. And I'm really excited to show all of that to you at Dreamforce as well as Data Cloud as well.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad. Emma, we'll take the next question now, please.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills. I mean, Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nSenior US Software Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. And congrats in particular to Amy and the whole team on overachieving unprofitability. My question, Marc, is for you. I wanted to drill down into Data Cloud because the things we keep hearing. From partners suggest that the interest level. Just keeps building and building. Can you talk about the pipeline and scope of these projects and how this generative AI moment is impacting the opportunity and why Salesforce is well positioned as the partner of choice, especially in the context of trust?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, especially as we've said on the call as well, which is that we've said this is about AI, this is about data, this is about CRM, and this is about trust. Those four things have to come together as one thing. And that's what we call Salesforce. That's a modern version of Salesforce is AI+ data+ CRM+ Trust. And I think that is really a moment that we have to, like, really get clear and show that to customers. We've tried to really bookend the last, you know, six months.\nObviously, we're going through a huge transformation with all of you, but you can see we've also gone through an incredible technology transformation around artificial intelligence to the point where we got these products out was awesome and let our customers really get into it and see what they can and cannot do, and what they're excited about, and how they want to move these products forward, and what we think is going to be the future of AI.\nAnd it's these four things together that are going to fundamentally help us. And I think Data Cloud, you're 100% right, is going to be the heart of it. Well, certainly it's a huge revenue opportunity for us because as you heard from Brian, customers who have Sales Cloud and they've got Service Cloud and they've got Marketing Cloud and they're using our platform, maybe they have Commerce Cloud, you know, as well, and now they're adding Data Cloud. And as these clouds get stacked with these customers, attrition falls, customers become more successful, they develop a single source of truth.\nAnd our job is to get all of these things running on our core and getting all these things ignited with artificial intelligence. So I was very excited to recruit back, you know, as my Chief of Staff and as my Chief Business Officer, Kendall Collins. So, Kendall, can you just give us a little insight into the vision of Dreamforce and what we're going to see for Data Cloud and some of these amazing clouds and why everyone should get excited about what's about to happen over the next couple weeks when everyone gets here into San Francisco on 12 September?\n\nKendall Collins\n\nChief of Staff and CBO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Mark, it's great to be back. It's been about four months and just amazing to see the energy of Salesforce, you know, a company with the right values and I think the right people and really at the right time. Generative, you know, what you said about AI is so compelling because it's not just about one cloud, it's about making every cloud better. Seeing that Sales GPT, Marketing GPT, Commerce GPT went live last week, and Dreamforce is going to be exciting.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I'm really excited as well. I'll tell you, you're sitting next to Sabastain Niles, our new Chief Legal Officer just joined us from Wachtell. Sabastain, we're happy to have you here live for the first earnings call. I know this is going to be your first Dreamforce and, you know, give us a vision of what you're excited about for the future.\n\nSabastian Niles\n\nCLO, Salesforce\n\nI'd say whether it's Dreamforce or sort. Looking ahead, what I've been most excited about is how our values, trust. Customer success, innovation, equality, and sustainability are truly infused within our culture and that these. Values, they're powering our customer journeys, they're powering our commitment to our investors, they're powering our commitment to all stakeholders. I think certainly as we look ahead, whether it's in the next several months. The next several years, the next 10 years and beyond, it's these values that are going to underlie how AI evolves and how, at least for sophisticated enterprises, and I think for all enterprises, and.\nEven individual human beings, they will choose to partner with the companies and organizations. Who are putting trust first and are deploying and incorporating trust throughout the technology life cycle. Whether that's design of technology, deployment of technology, development, service, and monitoring. I could not be more excited by what I see ahead.\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I couldn't be more excited to have you on our new management team and kind of the evolution of our team here at Salesforce. You know, thank you for all the help that you've given us also in the last six months, especially with all of our investors. Mike.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nOkay, thanks, Brad. Emma, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Large Cap Enterprise Software, Bank of America Securities\n\nMarc, 12% CRPO growth the last two quarters with AI billing into the model. Do you believe long-term you can reaccelerate this to a 15% to 20% growth business?\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair and CEO, Salesforce\n\nWell, I'll tell you that certainly on my mind every single day. And you know, you're right. You know, I'm a growth CEO, so that's what I like to do. I like to grow. I mean, that's been about growing margins for the last six months. So that's a reframe for me. But you know, we've grown this business to these incredible revenue numbers this year. Third largest software company in the world. And you know, as we kind of head into these incredible next levels of capability, I'm very excited about the future. And you know, there's lots and lots of ways to move the top line forward.\nBut I'll tell you now, I am quite addicted to the bottom line as well. And also, as I said earlier, there's nothing more important than the trust that I have of all of our stakeholders, including our investors. So I want to make sure that we fulfill our commitments and promises to all of you, just as we have in the last three earnings calls. We've delivered exactly as we've told you we are going to do, and we're going to continue to do that. At the same time, you know that I am thinking about how are we going to move this ball forward and down the field with these incredible opportunities in front of us.\nSo it's very much has to be a balanced equation to make this right, to make it right for, for us, and to make it right for you. And I'd love to have that conversation and more, more depth in the next couple weeks as we all come to Dreamforce. I hope you'll seek me out and find me and let's have that conversation one on one, just as we have been having the last six months. I want to do what I've been doing for the last couple quarters, which is to express my sincere gratitude to all of you. Our investors have been a critical part.\nYou've had key insights, many of which we did not have ourselves, on things that we could do to make us an even stronger company. We've done that. I'm sure you can see that in the numbers. There's never been a software company quite like this at this level. Even now as we start to cross into these incredibly high, incredible numbers in the mid $30 billion numbers, you know, the strength of the company has never been higher. Now we have this incredible opportunity with AI ahead.\n\nMike Spencer\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brent. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone, hopefully, at Dreamforce in a few weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n[inaudible]\n[inaudible]"

    "content": "Q1 2024 Salesforce Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2024 Salesforce Inc Earnings Call\n\nCRMNYSEMAY 31, 5:00 PM\n\nMarc Benioff\n\nChair, CEO and Co-Founder, Salesforce\n\nParamount, Siemens, Spotify, NASA, and the US Department of Agriculture, among others. We delivered $4.5 billion in operating cash flow, up 22% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligation ended the quarter at $46.7 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. And through Q1, we've now returned more than $6 billion in share repurchases. As a result, for the third quarter in a row, we ended the quarter with fewer shares year-over-year, another amazing point of evidence on this incredible transformation. Now, turning to our financial guidance. While the economy is not in our control, our margins are, which is why we're raising our margin target for the full fiscal year. For FY24, we're raising our non-GAAP operating margin to 28%, an improvement of 550 basis points year-over-year. And we remain confident that we'll hit 30% non-GAAP operating margins in the Q1 of fiscal year 25.\nWe could not be more excited about our progress. We're maintaining our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance of approximately $34.5 to 34.7 billion, over 10% projected growth year-over-year. I couldn't be more proud of how our team has come together, stepped up, and delivered these results. I've also been asked numerous times this quarter, by our investors and our customers, how we're able to make so much progress so fast and deliver these incredible numbers. It's very simple. It's our Ohana culture. It's our superpower. And again, I'd like to thank our amazing team for this incredible accomplishment. Last quarter, I told you how our AI team is getting ready to launch Einstein GPT, the world's first generative AI for CRM. At TrailheaDX in March, in front of thousands of trailblazers here in San Francisco, that's exactly what we did. At its foundation, Einstein GPT is open and extensible.\nCustomers can connect to multiple large language models, including from partners like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. This is a whole new way to work for our customers, users, and Trailblazers. Users on Salesforce are seeing new AI-generated features across all of their most common workflows. And while many of these will be created by Salesforce developers, far more will be created by our incredible Trailblazer ecosystem. For low-code Trailblazers, Einstein GPT will provide a toolset to design generative AI apps built on reasonable prompts. For pro-code Trailblazers, Einstein GPT will offer an extensible ecosystem of LLM providers with configurable grounding. And Einstein GPT is the culmination of tremendous research and engineering by our world-class AI team. And I'd like to congratulate them on this amazing result.\nAnd one more amazing result: this week, Einstein, Salesforce Einstein, that we've been talking about for so many years on these calls, will generate an incredible $1 trillion predictions for our customers, an incredible milestone on our AI journey. We saw more of the incredible work of our AI team at our New York City World Tour this month when we demonstrated Slack GPT. Slack is a secure treasure trove of company data that generative AI can use to give every company and every employee their own powerful AI assistant, helping every employee be more productive and transforming the future of work. Slack GPT can leverage the power of generative AI to deliver instant conversation summaries, research tools, and writing assistance directly in Slack. And you may never need to leave Slack to get a question answered.\nSlack is the perfect conversational interface for working with LLMs, which is why so many AI companies are Slack-first and why OpenAI, ChatGPT, and Anthropic;s Claude can now use Slack as a native interface. Slack is also delivering integrated sales and service experiences powered by native GPT to be the best interface for all of our Salesforce customers. And there's a lot more magic to come with Slack and generative AI. And this month, we also announced Tableau GPT at our Tableau conference, where we had over 8,000 in-person attendees. Tableau GPT simplifies data analysis for all of our users, enabling anyone to inquire about their data using Einstein GPT and obtain AI-driven insights at scale. The intelligence and automation that Tableau GPT provides is tremendously important in this area of hyperscale data that we're all entering.\nThe coming wave of generative AI will be more revolutionary than any technology innovation that's come before in our lifetime, or maybe any lifetime. Like Netscape Navigator, which opened the door to a greater internet, a new door has opened with generative AI, and it is reshaping our world in ways that we've never imagined. Every CEO realizes they're going to have to invest in AI aggressively to remain competitive, and Salesforce is going to be their trusted partner to get them to do just that. Every CEO I've spoken with sees AI as a revolution, beginning and ending with the customer. And every CIO I've spoken with wants more productivity, more automation, and more intelligence through using AI. A great example of already deploying this technology is Gucci.\nWe're working with them to augment their client advisors by building AI chat technology that creates a Guccified tone of service, well, an incredible new voice, amplifying brand storytelling and incremental sales as well. It's an incredibly exciting vision for generative AI to transform what was customer service into now customer service, marketing, and sales, all through augmenting Gucci employee capabilities using this amazing generative AI. But we can only do all of this with trust. Our customers need to understand where their data is going, and they must be able to maintain data integrity and access and privacy controls. Large customers must maintain data compliance as a critical part of their governance while using generative AI and LLMs. This is not true in the consumer environment, but it is true for our customers, our enterprise customers who demand the highest levels of this capability.\nFor customers who for years have used relational databases as the secure mechanism of their trusted data, they already have that high level of security to the row and cell level. We all understand that. That is why we have built our GPT Trust Layer into Einstein GPT. The GPT Trust Layer gives connected LLMs secure real-time access to data without the need to move all of your data into the LLM itself. It's an incredible breakthrough for our customers in working with LLMs in a secure and trusted way. While they're using the LLMs, the data itself is not moving and being stored in the LLM. That is what our customers want. They can be sure that the customer data is where they know it is, where they can be assured that it is for their compliance and for their governance.\nI could not be more excited about our AI CRM and delivering on this future of trusted AI through our new Salesforce GPT Trust Layer. Finally, I can't talk about AI without talking about the success of our Data Cloud. Data Cloud is the heart of Customer 360 and now our fastest-growing cloud ever. Data Cloud creates a real-time intelligent data lake that brings together and harmonizes all of our customers' data in one place. In Q1, we closed one of our largest healthcare industry deals ever with Northwell Health, New York's largest private employer. They have 21 hospitals, 900 outpatient facilities or ambulatory facilities, and their own medical school, all in New York.\nBy integrating Data Cloud with Health Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, well, our entire Customer 360 vision, Northwell Health is improving patient care by bringing together its vast data resources to create a single source of truth and using AI to govern data use and maintain regulatory compliance. This is the future of our customers and our industry. It's AI plus data plus CRM. Of course, this AI revolution is just getting started, which is why we've invested $250 million in our new AI venture fund to fuel startups developing our trusted generative AI vision. We'll be talking more about this at our AI Day event on 12 June in New York City, and I hope that you'll join me there. To wrap up, we're transforming every corner of our company. We're laser-focused on our short-term and long-term restructuring, improving productivity and performance, prioritizing our core innovations, and delivering for our shareholders.\nAs a result, productivity is up, profitability is up, revenue is up, cash flow is up, and we've dramatically increased our margin guidance. And just like the cloud, mobile, and social, well, AI, this revolution is a new innovation cycle. It's going to be a new spending cycle as well, which is going to spark a massive new tech buying cycle. And we've led the industry through each of these cycles, and I couldn't be more excited for our future as we continue on a path to our long-term goal to make Salesforce the largest, most profitable enterprise software company in the world and the number one safest and most trusted AI CRM. With that, Brian, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Marc. As Marc said, we're continuing our transformation across every part of our company. Our focus on performance, culture, and operational excellence contributed to our strong Q1 results. Since our last call, we've removed layers to get closer to our customers and took complexity out of our business to help us accelerate through the rest of the year. We clearly defined our return and remote office guidelines for our employees, and it's been great to get together even more in our offices and with our customers around the globe. I had the chance to visit many of our offices this quarter, and the energy is incredible. As you heard from Marc, our transformation plan continues to deliver top and bottom-line growth as we help our customers increase productivity, drive efficiency, and become AI-first companies. But we're still operating in an uncertain macro environment.\nCustomers continue to scrutinize every deal, and we see elongated deal cycles and deal compression, particularly in our more transactional revenue streams like SMB, create and close, and self-serve. Also in Q1, our professional service business started to see less demand for multi-year transformations and, in some cases, delayed projects as customers focus on quick wins and fast time to value. But for this reason, we saw strong performance from some of our fast time to value, efficiency-focused products with sales performance management, sales productivity, and digital service all growing annual recurring revenue above 40% in the quarter. As customers look to reduce complexity and achieve faster time to value, they're expanding their adoption of Salesforce Clouds, a key growth strategy for us. The world's most recognized companies are relying on Salesforce. More than 90% of the Fortune 100 use Salesforce, and they average more than five of our clouds.\nThis is why we are so excited about our AI plus data plus CRM strategy. As Mark explained, we're building Einstein GPT and Data Cloud into every cloud in our Customer 360, and we're perfectly positioned to help our customers harness the phenomenal power of AI. Our core offerings remain resilient. In Q1, nine of our top 10 deals included sales, service, and platform. Industry clouds continue to be a tailwind to our growth, and we saw momentum with great customers like Northwell, USDA Rural Development, and NASA, who we showcased at World Tour DC in April. Once again, eight of our industry clouds grew ARR above 50%. I met with hundreds of customers in the quarter, and we hosted 700 meetings in our innovation centers with our top customers and prospects.\nGenerative AI is top of mind for all of them as they look to benefit from the intelligence, automation, and cost savings that Salesforce is uniquely positioned to deliver. We're seeing tremendous appetite for our new generative AI products, starting with Einstein GPT, Slack GPT, and Data Cloud. Our generative AI products will be a catalyst for our future growth. As Marc mentioned, Data Cloud continues to be one of our fastest-growing products, and we have great wins in the quarter with companies like Major League Soccer and Giorgio Armani. Armani uses Data Cloud to deliver hyper-personalized online and in-store experiences, real-time engagement, and curated shopping recommendations. We can see how Data Cloud and Einstein GPT are going to create experiences that weren't possible before and really drive growth. In an environment where customers are optimizing their current tech stacks, integration and automation continue to be efficiency drivers.\nMuleSoft, again, delivered strong results with wins at Siemens, Sonova, and Vodafone. For the first time, Salesforce was ranked number one in integration by market share in the latest IDC software tracker, a great testament to our MuleSoft team. Tableau is unleashing the power of our Data Cloud, unlocking customer data and delivering actionable real-time insights. In the quarter, we had great wins at customers like Union Bank of the Philippines, Discover Financial Services, Moderna, ADT Solar, and Alaska Air. We've made great investments to re-accelerate Tableau, including new leadership, along with product innovations like Tableau GPT and Revenue Intelligence, now one of our fastest-growing add-ons. I'm really encouraged by the Slack team, who has created an ambitious product roadmap with generative AI at the center.\nIn Q1, we saw amazing momentum with customers like the California Office of System Integration, Paramount Global, Revel, and OpenAI, and rolled out an AI-ready platform, Slack Canvas, and app integrations with ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. Overall, I could not be more thrilled with our offerings and the market position, especially as it relates to delivering on the promise of AI. We're looking forward to continuing the energy and momentum at our AI Day in just a couple of weeks. I'm very proud of the teams and of our partners. Their focus on customer success continues to be outstanding. As Mark said, our productivity is up, profitability is up, revenue is up, cash flow is up. We're increasing our margin guidance, and Salesforce is leading the way as the number one AI CRM. Now over to you, Amy.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nThank you, Brian. As Marc said, a key part of our transformation to profitable growth is short and long-term restructuring of the company. We have now largely completed the restructuring announced in January, and we're completing our comprehensive operating and go-to-market review. As we shift to the implementation phase, we're executing against three key pillars: optimization of resources and organization structure, product investment prioritization, and operational rigor. We continue to view sales and marketing and G&A as the primary drivers of leverage, while R&D remains an important investment area. Our profitable growth framework, disciplined capital allocation strategy, and opportunity to drive shareholder value are represented in our actions and in our results. Now, turning to our results for Q1, fiscal year 24, beginning with top-line commentary.\nFor the Q1, revenue was $8.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, or 13% in constant currency, with the beat primarily driven by strong momentum in MuleSoft and more resilient core performance. Geographically, we saw strong new business growth in parts of EMEA and LATAM, specifically Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, while we experienced continued pressure in the United States. In Q1, the Americas revenue grew 10%, EMEA grew 12% or 17% in constant currency, and APAC grew 16% or 24% in constant currency. From an industry perspective, manufacturing, automotive, and energy all performed well, while high-tech and financial services remained under pressure. Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at approximately 8%. As expected, we saw a modest increase in Q1, partially attributed to the inclusion of Tableau in the metric. We also noted some incremental weakness in our marketing and commerce attrition.\nAs Mark said, Non-GAAP operating margin finished strong in Q1 at 27.6%, driven by our disciplined investment strategy and accelerating our restructuring efforts. Q1 Operating Cash Flow was $4.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This includes a 910 basis points headwind from restructuring. Q1 Free Cash Flow was $4.2 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Turning to Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, this ended Q1 at $46.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Current Remaining Performance Obligation, or CRPO, ended at $24.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by strong core performance, partially offset by continued create and close softness. Finally, we continue to deliver on our capital return commitment.\nIn Q1, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of share repurchases, bringing the total return to more than $6 billion since the program was initiated last August, representing more than 38 million shares. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to briefly touch on the current macro environment that Brian discussed. The more measured buying behavior persisted in Q1. As Brian noted, in Q1, we started to see weakness in our professional services business. We expect these factors to persist, which is incorporated in our guidance. Let's start with fiscal year 24. On revenue, we are holding our guidance of $34.5 to 34.7 billion, representing over 10% growth year-over-year in both nominal and constant currency. The strength in our Q1 performance is offset by the pressure in our professional services business previously discussed.\nFor fiscal year 2024, we are raising non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 28%, representing a 550 basis points improvement year-over-year. This guidance increase is driven by the acceleration of our restructuring efforts and also includes reinvestment in targeted areas, mainly in R&D. I'm proud of our progress and remain confident in our trajectory as we progress towards our 30% non-GAAP operating margin target in Q1 2025. We also remain focused on stock-based compensation and continue to expect it to improve this year to below 9% as a percent of revenue. Before moving to EPS, on restructuring, we now expect the charges in FY 2024 to come in towards the higher end of the range previously provided in our last earnings release. As a result of these updates, we now expect fiscal year 24 GAAP EPS of $2.67 to 2.69 cents, including estimated charges for the restructuring of $1.11 cents.\nNon-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $7.41 to 7.43 cents. We are raising our fiscal year 2024 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 16% to 17%, which now includes a 14 to 16 headwind from restructuring. As a reminder, we will see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal 2024 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses. CapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 17% to 18% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q2. On revenue, we expect $8.51 to 8.53 billion, growth of approximately 10% in both nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be approximately 10% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency.\nOur guidance incorporates the momentum of our execution in Q1, offset by the persistent measured buying behavior and a decline in professional services fixed fees contribution. The professional services impact represents approximately a 1-point headwind to growth. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.79 to 0.80 cents and non-GAAP EPS of $1.89 to 1.90 cents. As we focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, we continue to expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year 24. In closing, we continue to transform every corner of the company. We are hyper-focused on delivering the next wave of innovation led by Data Cloud and Einstein GPT, and Salesforce is well-positioned to remain the market leader in this new AI-first world. We are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value, and I personally want to thank our shareholders for their continued support.\nNow, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Amy. Operator, we'll move to questions now. I ask that everyone only ask one question in respect for others on the call. In addition, I'd like to introduce Srini Tallapragada, our head of engineering, who will be joining us for Q&A today. With that, Emma, let's move to the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question today comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a good start to the year. Mark, you've been through a number of cycles from a technology perspective. I was just kind of curious where you think we are in terms of people investigating AI versus when the spending cycle around it might kick in. Just give us an idea of sort of your thoughts on that and really just the opportunity for you all to monetize AI within your product base. Thanks.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think this is the absolute question of the day, which is we are about to enter an unbelievable super cycle for tech, and everyone can see that. This is an incredible opportunity for not only Salesforce, but our entire industry. I mean, perhaps only a year ago or less than a year ago, no one on this call even knew what GPT was. Today, ChatGPT is the fastest-growing consumer product of all time and has transformed many, many lives. It's definitely not just the technology of this lifetime, but maybe any lifetime. It's an incredible technology, and every company is going to have to transform because every company is going to have to become more productive, more automated, more intelligent through this technology to be competitive with other companies.\nJust yesterday, I'm in a room here at the top of Salesforce Tower on the 60th floor, and we have the CEO of a very large bank here. Like every other sales call I've made in the last quarter, there's only one thing that customers want to talk about, and that's artificial intelligence and specifically generative AI. Of course, we have been a leader in this area with Einstein, more than a trillion transactions delivered this week. But these are primarily predictive transactions built on machine intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. But in 2018, deep learning evolved and became much more sophisticated and became generative. As these neural networks expanded their capabilities, and also the hardware went to another level as well. So now we have this incredible new capability. It's a new platform for growth, and I couldn't be more excited.\nBut yesterday, there were many questions from my friend who I'm not going to give you his name because he's one of the CEO of one of the largest and most important banks in the world. And I'll just say that, of course, his primary focus is on productivity. He knows that he wants to make his bankers a lot more successful. He wants every banker to be able to rewrite a mortgage, but not every banker can because writing a mortgage takes a lot of technical expertise. But as we showed him in the meeting through a combination of Tableau, which we demonstrated, and Slack, which we demonstrated, and Salesforce's Financial Services Cloud, which he has tens of thousands of users on, that banker understood that this would be incredible. But I also emphasized to him that LLMs, or large language models, they have a voracious appetite for data.\nThey want every piece of data that they can consume. But through his regulatory standards, he cannot deliver all that data into the LLM because it becomes amalgamated. Today, he runs on Salesforce, and his data is secure down to the row and cell level. He knows that readers don't block writers, that there's all types of security provisions regarding who can see what data about what account or what customer. And when you put it into an LLM, those permissions are not understood. So that is a very powerful moment to realize that the way that LLMs operate in a weight state where they're kind of consuming all this data and then giving us that information back out. Well, that's Salesforce's opportunity. That's why we built this GPT Trust Layer.\nThrough the GPT Trust Layer and rebuilding all of our apps, including Slack and Tableau, but as we demonstrated to him yesterday: a new Sales Cloud, a new Service Cloud, a new Marketing Cloud, and what we'll show on 12 June in New York City, a complete reconceptualization of our product line. What that means for this customer and for every customer is that they have an opportunity to transform their business. For Salesforce, that also means an opportunity to transform ourselves and for our industry, a new super cycle where every company will have to transform to be AI-first.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nElizabeth Porter\n\nSenior Vice President, Wealth Management, Financial Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. This is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the potential disruption from rebooting the sales enablement process. Are we past the point of seeing disruption, or could that be a future risk? And if so, how is it included in guidance? The CRPO guidance for 10% looks like a bit of a slowdown despite the easier comp. And Amy, you called out pro services at one point headwind. But just any other factors we should keep in mind that may create a challenge over the next couple of months? Thank you.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, I'll tell you that I think that, as you know, in Q1, we went through tremendous disruption with human resources in our company, and it was very disruptive to all of our Ohana. And I'm so grateful to them for how they supported the whole company, all the customers, and themselves during what was probably one of the most disruptive quarters that I've seen, and yet we delivered these incredible numbers and this incredible technology vision going forward. In terms of enablement of the sales organization, its ability to kind of move forward, that is not, I would say, a material part of what happened in the quarter or what's going to happen for the year. Our sales organization remains with a very high level of productivity. But let me turn it over to Brian to speak directly to his strategy on delivering the year.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Mark, thank you. I appreciate it. And Elizabeth, thank you for the question. I think you're referencing some comments we made on previous calls about enablement being an important strategy for us, as we saw during the pandemic. Not as many of our AEs and SEs and leaders were as enabled as we would like. We've made those changes, and we've really invested in the time to make sure our AEs understand our product portfolio, the entire Customer 360. And we're on sort of the next generation of enablement. As Mark just talked about, this new AI wave is going to create a huge opportunity for us, and we need to make sure that we're investing in the enablement to bring our teams along.\nIt's been a very short window around this innovation, and we've got some work to do on this, but we're very, very excited with our path forward, our position in the market, all that we're doing with our customers, the demand we're feeling from our customers. Mark mentioned it, and I had the same experience. Every CEO in the world is talking to us about generative AI right now, and we are investing heavily to make sure our account executives, our sales teams, in fact, the entire company is able to articulate our value proposition to our customers. So, Amy, I don't know if you have any further comments there.\n\nElizabeth Porter\n\nSenior Vice President, Wealth Management, Financial Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. Elizabeth, you mentioned CRPO and professional services, so let me jump in on that. For our guide for this next quarter, we are seeing some pressures from the macro situation and then also specifically from professional services. There's a bit of a nuance with pro service. I want to make sure people understand. So if you back up, our customers can contract for professional services in two ways: either on a time and materials basis, which is typically used for smaller projects, or on a fixed fee kind of milestone basis. For purposes of CRPO, we only include projected revenue from fixed fee deals. One of the things that we are seeing right now is not only is professional services as a whole seeing pressure, but more customers are choosing to contract on a time and materials basis, which is not included in our CRPO.\nSo as a result, we're seeing kind of a double pressure there, and I'm expecting a full one-point headwind to CRPO for the quarter from professional services.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. Emma, let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, wonderful. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question to Brian, I think, here on the efforts here to improve productivity. You mentioned removing some layers here. My question is, we think of all these actions that you're taking as drivers of margin expansion, but are you starting to see some early traction here on the sales productivity front such that perhaps that's driving some upside here across the business, perhaps larger deals now that you're seeing coming out of the field, pipeline, and some of the deal closure? Thank you so much.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brad, for the question. I really appreciate it. As you know, we're operating in a constrained environment right now, and so we are really focused on this productivity measure and metric for our organization right now, investing heavily, as I mentioned earlier, in the enablement part of our organization. Also looking at other ways to drive productivity. And one of the things that we're talking quite a bit about right now is pricing and packaging, bringing together logical products that we can be selling in a single motion versus our go-to-market, which is largely aligned by product. How do we focus on a larger average deal size for every transaction? And so big investments on that front. Really a strong focus on productivity as it relates to moving people up market as well. We're thinking about self-serve in the bottom end of our market.\nHow do we drive a self-serve motion, automated motion at the low end of our market to bring our account executives up market to drive higher productivity in the sales organization? So clearly a big motion for us right now. Feel very good about our big deal motion. Actually, in Q4, we saw some - sorry, Q1, we saw some very good big deal execution from the team. That is not really an area that has held us back. We feel very good about our ability to transform companies and transact these large businesses. It really is the velocity business that has held us back a bit on our create and close, some of the SMB transactions. So we have a clear focus in this area to drive the productivity with our plans going into Q2 and beyond into Q4.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brian. Emma, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Software/Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nAmy, regarding Americas, that was a pretty large decel, one of your slowest growth quarters, I think, ever in Americas. The rest of the world did decel, but maybe not quite as the magnitude of the Americas. Can you just speak to what happened there in that region?\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nSure. So thanks, Brad, for the question. The Americas did see a deceleration, a 10% year-on-year revenue growth compared to 17% in EMEA and about 24% in nominal APAC. We are continuing to see most of the pressure in North America. There were some real pockets of acceleration in EMEA and in LATAM, particularly in Switzerland, I think, Brazil, and Italy. So we are seeing some good things, but North America has taken the brunt of the deceleration. Brian, do you want to come in and see if you can address that in more detail?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nSure. Yeah. I think when we think about our business from an industry perspective, we have a very nice footprint of our great technology companies and financial services companies, both of which were a bit slower than we would have liked in the Americas in Q1. So as we think about the overall side of our Americas business, those industries felt a little bit more of the economic headwind in the quarter in Q1. I think a bit of a slowdown from that perspective is a result you're seeing in the Americas business.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Brian. Emma, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much. I'll add my congrats. So Mark, it feels like the tech and software industry has had a recession without the broader economy being in a recession quite yet, and that's very unusual. Do you think with all the purging and optimizing of IT budgets, which is already taking place, plus Salesforce's headcount optimization already being underway, that perhaps the next recession might actually be more manageable or easier to navigate than what you had seen in some of the prior cycles?\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think that this is a great question, and I tried to address it on the last call. I just really think you have to look at 2020, 2021 was just this massive super cycle called the pandemic. I don't know if you remember, but we had a pandemic a couple of years ago, and during that, we saw tech buying like we never saw. It was incredible. And everybody surged on tech buying. So you're really looking at comparisons against that huge mega cycle, and that is what I think is extremely important to understand, the relative comparisons. And that is where my head is at, which is I am constantly comparing against what happened in 2021, but also looking at 2020 and 2019. That's a little bit different than 2008, and that's a little bit different than 2001.\nWe didn't exactly have these huge mega cycles that kind of we were exiting. And that's also what gives me tremendous confidence going forward, in that what we're really seeing is that customers are absorbing the huge amounts of technology that they bought, and that is about to come, I believe, to a close. I can't give you the exact date, and it's going to be accelerated by this AI super cycle.\nThank you. Thanks, Marc. Emma, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Equity Capital Markets, Piper Sandler\n\nGood afternoon. I wanted to circle back to the generative AI discussion if we could. I totally understand how large enterprises are turning to Microsoft given the productivity tools and suite that they have. But as you start to engage with customers, what's resonating relative to the Salesforce GenAI journey? Is it the data layer and Customer 360 message that's resonating? Is it the app layer around sales automation functionality that you're going to offer? Just double-click on what customers are coming to Salesforce and engaging with you around some of the new things that we'll hear about, it sounds like, in June.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, I think that when you look at our artificial intelligence strategy, which, as we're talking to the largest, most important companies and governments in the world, it has to be architected around security. It has to be architected around compliance, around trust. It has to be architected around governance. And this is very important. And of course, we're also architecting it around being open. That is, we're working with many AI companies to provide the best solutions for our company. Of course, we have a tremendous relationship with OpenAI. We also just invested in Anthropic, Cohere, many of these companies. But I think ultimately this is going to be a solution that enterprise customers are going to come in and make sure that their data is protected, and it's also protected down at the user level.\nSrini, do you want to come in and talk about exactly what we're doing to make sure that we're delivering the best possible solutions for our customers for AI?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nHead of Engineering, Salesforce\n\nYes, Mark. So I think I met about 70 customers in the last quarter, and like Mark was saying, the only conversation everybody is interested in is on AI. And while everybody understands the use cases, they're really worried about trust. And what they are looking for us is guidance on how to solve that. For example, so we are doing a lot of things. At the basic security level, we are really doing tenant-level isolation coupled with zero-retention architecture at the LLM level so that LLM doesn't remember any of the data. Along with that, for them to use these use cases, they want to have, they have a lot of these compliances like GDPR, ISO, SOC, and FedRAMP. They want to ensure that those compliances are still valid, and we're going to solve it for that.\nIn addition, the big worry everybody has is people have heard about hallucinations, toxicity, bias. This is what we call Model Trust. We have a lot of innovation around how to ground the data on 360 data, which is a huge advantage we have, and we are able to do a lot of things at that level. Then the thing which I think Marc hinted at, which is LLMs are not like a database. These intra-enterprise trusts, even once you have an LLM, you can't open the data to everybody in the company. So you need the ability to do this: who can access this data? How is it doing both before the query and after the query? We have to build that. Then we have to be not only open but also optimized.\nWe are running an open. The way we'll run is we'll run like a model tournament because one of the things everybody has to watch out is it's great, but what about the cost to serve? Not all models are equal. So we are going to run this and pick. We are going to pick a very cost-optimized curve, so the value is very high. And our Salesforce AI research has a lot of Salesforce state-of-the-art models and industry cases which we are optimizing to run at very low cost and high value. Add to that, we've got the Trailblazer platform, which allows low-code, high-code, and many other things. And we're going to optimize for the jobs to be done for each industry and job cost. That's really what they're looking for because they have been using our AI platform. Like Mark mentioned, we already do a trillion transactions per day.\nBy the way, the Data Cloud, just in a month, we are importing more than seven trillion records into the data layer, which is a very powerful asset we have. Coupled with all of this is what they are looking for guidance and how we think we can deliver significant value to our customers.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nSrini, I want to ask you a question. In January, you published a paper in Nature from your research team, which was called Large Language Models Generating Functional Protein Sequences Across Diverse Families. And you really showed something amazing, which was that deep learning language models have shown this incredible promise that you just articulated in various biotechnological applications, including protein design, engineering. And you also described very well one of our models that we've created internally, ProGen, which was a language model that can generate protein sequences with predictable function across large protein families. I was very impressed with that. And the entire research team deserves a huge amount of congratulations.\nSo when you look at that, especially akin to generating grammatically and semantically correct large natural language sentences for diverse topics or how you're going to use that inside our platform against other models that you're seeing like LLaMA, OpenAI's model, Anthropic, and others, when will Salesforce use our own models like CodeGen, ProGen, T-code, our BLIP model? When will we use an outside commercial model like an OpenAI or an Anthropic? And when will we go to an open-source model like we've seen emerge in so many of those, including LLaMA?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nHead of Engineering, Salesforce\n\nYeah. I think you hinted at something very important. I think, as you know, Mark, we have our AI research team as one of the best-in-class models, state-of-the-art models from different areas. The way we are thinking of it is like anything else. Where the world is going to go, which we strongly believe, is going to be multiple models. Depending on the use case, you will pick the right models which will provide you the value at the lowest cost. Where we have to run with highly regulated industries where the data cannot leave the trust boundary or where we have significant advantage, where we can train on industry-specific data or Salesforce-specific, 360-specific data, like, for example, our FX model is helping our customers implement our Flow, we will use our internal model.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nWhere we need more generated image models or something where it needs public image databases, we may use a Cohere, an Anthropic, or an OpenAI. It depends on the use case, which is why at a given request, our secure trusted gateway will decide smartly which is the best use case, which is the model. And we always keep running the tournament, which is what I mean. So today, one particular model may be good. Tomorrow, something else will come, and we'll, behind the scenes, flip it. But our customers don't need to know that. We will handle all of it. We'll handle the model trust. We'll handle all the compliances and all behind the scenes. And this is always what we promise to our customers. We'll always future-proof. That's the Salesforce promise to our customers so that they can focus on the business use cases.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nJust one last follow-up question. You've described very well this GPT Trust Layer, which I think is going to be a significant amount of value added that we're going to provide to our customers. It's going to be quite amazing. Then you've developed these specific grounding techniques which are going to allow us to keep our customers' data safe and not be consumed by these voracious large language models, which are so hungry for all of our customers' data. What is going to be the key to actually delivering this now across regulated industries?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nI think the key is innovations we are doing, which people will see starting next month, is around what we call prompt generation and grounding. These are techniques which we'll have to do, but it'll work only because all of this is based on underlying data. We have the Data Cloud where we have all the 360 data which is there. So we're able to ground these models and do it. But there are a lot of other techniques which are very technical, which we put on our blogs. But that's the innovation that we're doing. And you have to remember that Salesforce also is a metadata model. So we have a semantic understanding of what our customers are trying to do. We're going to leverage the metadata platform and do this grounding automatically for our customers, of course, while keeping the trust. That's the baseline.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you so much, Srini. Emma, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Question for Amy or Brian, maybe more. The improvement in profitability or the raised guidance for profitability and cash, is that all timing? And you talked a little bit about that. Is it just timing, or are there other factors we should consider here? Thank you.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nSo, Raimo, why don't I start, then I can turn it over to Brian for a little bit more color? So in terms of the great Q1 that we just saw, really pleased to see it coming in at 27.6%. And also really pleased about the 28%, the raise to 28% for the full year. What really drove the 27.6 was two things. It was the actions that we took that we announced in January with the restructuring, executing on that, as well as having a very disciplined reinvestment strategy. And that led to that. And that's also where we're going to see this going for the rest of the year, driving the expansion to 28% and then also putting us on track for the 30% margin in Q1 of next year.\nAs I look, though, overall at transformation, I would really divide it into two stages: benefits that we're getting from that initial transformation. And again, that's what you're seeing in Q1 and this year. And then the second stage, which is really, as we've been going through this comprehensive operating and go-to-market review, that review is going to enable the second phase of our transformation. And that's something that's going to be ongoing and long-term over the next few years. You'll see benefits to our margin in out years beyond FY 24. Brian, anything you would add?\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nYeah, Raymond, thanks for the question. When we think about longer-term structures, we obviously took the action in Q1. But longer-term, we're looking at things like how do we leverage comp plan redesign to drive better efficiencies in our organization going forward? How do we continue to look at self-serve at the low end of the market to drive better efficiencies in our organization? So resellers as a potential investment that we'll make in emerging markets is long-term leverage on the efficiency gains. So lots of things that we're doing that will be in sort of this phase two oriented around process improvement and systems improvement. And again, as I mentioned, comp plan design that will drive better efficiencies in the organization.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Raimo. Emma, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director. Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, great. I'll direct this to Amy as well. Amy, congrats on that margin improvement. I've got a two-parter both related to margins. First, what is the timing of the receipt of that Bain operational review that might ostensibly kick off the second phase of cost-cutting? And then secondly, you and Brian talked about this reinvestment in R&D and investing heavily around AI. I'm wondering if those planned investments are greater than you anticipated when you initially set the guidance three months ago, such that you need to run a little bit harder on OpEx management to offset it and keep delivering on your stated margin targets. Thanks so much.\n\nAmy Weaver\n\nPresident and CFO, Salesforce\n\nGreat. Thanks, Karl. So first on the timing, as I mentioned, we've been doing this end-to-end comprehensive operating and go-to-market review. The entire company has been involved in that. There's really no stone unturned. We're getting close to the end of that process, and then we will be moving into the implementation. You'll be hearing more about that in future quarters. Turning to reinvestment, we are keeping a very close eye on reinvestment, very excited, particularly about artificial intelligence, much of what Srini has been talking to you about. I don't view this as a greater investment from what we were looking at earlier. We're really going along with our current plans. We are looking at operating expenses management, and we're looking at it seriously every day, but that's not something that has changed.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nThanks, Karl. Emma, we'll move to our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nExcellent. Our last question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs",
    "content2": "Hi. Thank you very much, team. Congratulations on putting up a terrific operational results with good cash flow, good margins, etc. Mark, you talked about a super cycle of buying and technology in the years ahead. Can you just distill for us, if you don't mind, what is new about generative AI as far as Salesforce's opportunities are concerned, netting out against what Einstein has been able to accomplish for the company? And how does it show up in the product in terms of productivity? What are the scenarios by which customers can experience this amazing productivity, and how can you charge more for delivering that kind of value? Thank you so much.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, thanks, Kash, for giving me the opportunity to talk about our AI vision. I'm also going to ask Srini again to fill in some of the details. I think it started to occur to me. I think a lot of folks know my neighbor, Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI. I went over to his house for dinner, and it was a great conversation. As it always is with him. He said, Oh, just hold on one second, Mark. I want to get my laptop. He brought his laptop out and gave me some demonstrations of advanced technologies that are not appropriate for the call. I did notice that there was only one application that he was using on his laptop, and that was Slack.\nAnd the powerful part about that was, I realized that everything from day one at OpenAI had been in Slack. And as we kind of brainstormed and talked about, of course, he was paying a Slack user fee and on and on. And he's a great Slack customer. We've done a video about them. It's on YouTube. But I realized that taking an LLM and embedding it inside Slack, well, maybe Slack will wake up. I mean, there is so much data in Slack. I wonder if it could tell him, \"What are the opportunities in OpenAI? What are the conflicts? What are the conversations? What should be his prioritization? What is the big product that got repressed that he never knew about?\" And I realized in my own version of Slack at Salesforce, I have over 95 million Slack messages, and these are all open messages.\nI'm not talking about closed messaging or direct messaging or secure messaging between employees. I'm talking about the open framework that's going on inside Salesforce and with so many of our customers. And then I realized, \"Wow, I think Slack could wake up, and it could become a tremendous asset with an LLM consuming all that data and driving it.\" And then, of course, the idea is as bold as a new version of Slack. Not only do you have the free version of Slack, not only do you have the per-user version of Slack, but then you have the additional LLM version of Slack.\nFor each one of our products in every single one of our categories, there's that opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into the next version of generative AI, not just with Slack, but you can also imagine, for example, even with Salesforce, the ability, as we're going to see in June, that many of our Trailblazers are amazing low-code, no-code Trailblazers, but soon they'll have the ability to tap into our LLMs like ProGen and CodeGen that have the ability to code for them automatically. They aren't coders. They didn't graduate computer science degrees. And if they need to write sophisticated APEX code or other code, it can be a challenge for them. But because what is there? Only eight or 10 million coders in the whole world. But now with LLMs, everybody can start to code. That's an amazing productivity and augmentation of everybody's skill set.\nAnd that's a great way to look at what could happen, for example, with our core products, but even with Tableau, which has a tremendous programmatic engine as well, or even MuleSoft, which is a highly programmatic product that then, coupled with an LLM, can have the ability to go forward. But of course, those LLMs are highly trained models for those specific types of code. And then that is something that we would add on either through partnership or through our own LLM, as Srini described. It's another layer of value that we can provide to our customers. In all cases, customers are going to be more productive. They're going to be more automated, and they're going to be more intelligent.\nAs we look at some of the examples that we've given, like at the New York World Tour, you saw our Marketing Cloud do something very cool that it couldn't do even just six months ago. It segmented the database on its own. It wrote an email on its own. Of course, it required editing. It also built a landing page on its own. That was amazing. Or as we saw at the Tableau conference, we saw Tableau being able to create its own visits or visualizations. That was incredible. And what we saw at our TrailheaDX, we saw Einstein GPT, which started to do these amazing next-generation things. And I think in each of these areas, we can offer more value. But we must do it in the auspices of trust, data integrity, and governance.\nAnd that is what we have been working on now for a considerable amount of time. Of course, we've led. We have always wanted to be the number one AI CRM, and we are. If you look at Einstein's transaction level, I think that that's enough evidence right there. But I think this idea of generative AI, this starts to reconceptualize every product. And we will start to build and develop not only extensions to all of our current products, but entirely new products as well. And we have a lot of exciting ideas of things that we can do to help our customers connect with their customers in a new way using generative AI. Srini, do you want to come in and talk about that?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nHead of Engineering, Salesforce\n\nThanks a lot. So, I think the way I see it is this: AI technologies are on a continuum. There is predictive, then there is generative, and the real long-term goal is autonomous. The initial version of the generative AI will be more in terms of assistance. And like Mark was saying, we are seeing the most common use case everybody understands implicitly is self-service bots or in the call center or agent assistants, which I think really helps productivity. But the other use cases which we are going to see, and in fact, I've rolled out our own code LLMs in our engineering org, and we are already seeing minimum 20% productivity. And in those cases.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, that's a very key point, isn't it? That you are seeing a 30% productivity increase in your own engineering using our own LLMs.\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nHead of Engineering, Salesforce\n\n20%, we are seeing minimum, in some cases until 30%. Now, a lot of our customers are asking the same. We are going to roll Einstein GPT for our developers in the ecosystem, which will not only help not only the low-code developers to bridge the gaps where there's a talent gap, but also it reduces the cost of implementations for a lot of people. So there's a lot of value. So this assistant model is where we'll see a lot of uptick. And then I think the fully autonomous cases, for example, in our own internal use cases with our models, we are able to detect 60% of incidents and auto-remediate. That requires a little bit more fine-tuning, and we'll have to work with specific customers to get to that level of model performance. So I see this is just at the start of this cup.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident and COO, Salesforce\n\nThe assistant model is the initial thing to build trust, and a human in the loop, and validate it. Then as the models get better and better, we'll keep taking use cases where we can fully automate it.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nAddress this one issue that a lot of customers come in like they did yesterday, and they tell us they think they're just going to take all of their data, all their customer data, all of their information, and put it into an LLM and create a corporate knowledge base. It's going to be one amalgamated database. Why is that a false prophecy?\n\nSrini Tallapragada\n\nHead of Engineering, Salesforce\n\nBecause even today, any example you see, even though we have hundreds of Slack channels, there are a lot of specific Slack channels which only you want access to. You don't want that. LLM doesn't know. There is no concept of it. It combines all this information. So unless you put the layer both before who can access the data, and then, when it generates response, what it can do, you don't want one wealth manager to generally generate a report, an account report, where you're mixing customers' balances. So there are a lot of trust issues we have to solve. The LLMs are good for a lot of very creative generative use cases. Initially, where it's public data, where everybody can use it, those are use cases.\nI think there are enough of low-hanging fruit in the initial phases with the assistant model, which will solve the really complex automated cases, the role-level, record-level sharing. We have a lot of techniques which we are developing, which we will do. It's also a research area too. That one, I think we should be tempered with expectations. But there's enough of, like I said, the developer example I gave, productivity example I gave, there's enough of productivity which we'll get.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nExecutive Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, Salesforce\n\nWell, we're really excited to show all of this technology at our AI Day on 12 June in New York City. And then also when we get to Dreamforce GPT, we're going to have an incredible demonstration of this technology. So with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks. Have a great one.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nGeneral Manager, Investor Relations, Microsoft Corp.\n\nGood afternoon and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2023 fourth quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Finance Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nAs a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and hey, thanks to all of you for joining the call. As you can see from our results, we had another strong quarter. Improving profitability is our highest priority, and that really showed up this quarter. Our goal is to make Salesforce the largest and most profitable software company in the world, and that is what we are doing.\nSix months ago, in September at our Dreamforce Investor Day, we shared with you our comprehensive transformation plan, the new day for profitable growth. But things have changed. As we entered our fourth quarter, we recognized that we needed to radically accelerate the transformation plan time frame. We need to press the hyperspace button and bring the 2-year goals forward quickly and exceed them.\nNow we immediately put into place an accelerated transformation plan, 4 areas: short-term and long-term restructuring of the company; improving profitability and productivity; prioritizing our core innovations; and a deeper and even stronger relationship with our shareholders, you. In fact, that's where we started.\nThe very first thing we did when I became sole CEO 3 months ago was Amy and I promoted Mike Spencer, our Head of IR, to our leadership team. So we're all in much more communication with all of you.\nWe're now moving aggressively across all 4 fronts of our transformation. First, we're reigniting our performance culture and doubling down on our accountable management of our sales organization, as you're about to hear from Brian. As you know, beginning in January, we also initiated a headcount reduction, and we're significantly consolidating our real estate footprint.\nSecond, we're more closely scrutinizing every dollar of investment and resource and very focused on driving operational excellence and automation across the business. Third, our amazing engineering team is focused on integrating our acquisitions and prioritizing our core innovations that are driving customer success.\nAnd finally, as we set in motion, longer-term structural improvements, we're working with Bain on a comprehensive operating and go-to-market review. To ensure a high degree of accountability, our Board is forming a new business transformation committee, which I have joined, and we have fully disbanded our M&A committee as well to reflect our new focus.\nWe also dramatically stepped up our communication feedback loop with our investment community, and I hope you all are feeling that. For the past several months, all visits Salesforce, including me, all of our Board members, including our Lead Independent Director, Robin Washington and our senior management team have spent a lot of time listening to and working with all of our investors.\nAs I said, we've hit that hyperspace button since we last talked to you a quarter ago, and I'm thrilled with the progress we've made. Changes that used to take months are happening in weeks. Changes that used to take weeks are happening in days. And changes that used to take days are happening in hours.\nPowered by this transformation, we delivered another strong quarter. Our team really delivered on both the top and bottom line, exceeding our expectations. As I said, improving our profitability is our highest priority. And in Q4, we accelerated operating margin to a new record high.\nNon-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '23 was 22.5%, significantly above our forecast, an improvement of almost 4 points year-over-year. Revenue was $8.38 billion, up 14% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, which is above what we forecast to deliver for the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered $31.4 billion in revenue, up 18% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency. It's one of the best performances of any enterprise software company our size, and it's amazing that Salesforce is now over $30 billion in revenue.\nWe closed fiscal year '23 with operating cash flow reaching $7.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year, the highest cash flow in our company's history and one of the highest cash flows of any enterprise software company our size ever.\nI also want to call out the great progress we have made with MuleSoft and Tableau. As you know, we've been focused over the past few quarters on reigniting MuleSoft sales growth, and this quarter was evidence that those efforts are paying off beautifully. MuleSoft was included in 7 of our top 10 deals in the quarter, and Tableau was included in every one of our top 10 deals.\nThese acquired products are integral to our Customer 360 and enabling our customers to use our data product line to achieve a new level of excellence in managing their customer relationships and its critical data. In short, our transformation has been radically accelerated. As you can see, our performance is significantly up already. Our productivity is also up. Our profitability is up, and we are not done.\nNow we're putting into place the next phase of our transformation to profitable growth. We just rolled out our new business plan, which we call the V2MOM in partnership with our employees worldwide. Everyone in the company is now aligned around our highest priorities and our aspirations.\nI'm excited to announce that looking forward to fiscal year '24, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%, an additional acceleration of 4.5 points year-over-year. And for fiscal year '24 revenue, we're guiding to $34.7 billion at the high end of the range, over 10% projected year-over-year growth. But that's not all, we're also looking at our overall share count.\nAnd as we focus on reducing dilution, we've already returned $4 billion of the original $10 billion authorization in our share repurchase plan that we announced in August. And our Board has now approved a substantial increase in that share repurchase plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. This will allow us to fully offset dilution from stock-based compensation.\nWe're also thrilled to welcome 3 new members to our Board, Mason Morfit, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital; Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation; and Sachin Mehra, the Chief Financial Officer of Mastercard, 3 amazing executives who have already made their mark on business, and I'm looking forward to them making their mark on Salesforce.\nWe're incredibly happy that these phenomenal executives are joining us to help guide our next level of profitable growth. That makes 5 new Board members we have brought on in just the past 16 months, another import of our accelerated transformation.\nI also want to say how grateful we are to our 2 outgoing Board members, Sandy Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld, both of whom many of you know and who, for the last 2 decades, have given Salesforce and our industry incredible leadership, guidance and service. Thank you so much, Alan and Sandy.\nWe know that we have the right team, the right strategy and the right products to compete and complete this transformation. And we're continuing to build our future. I've never been more inspired by our engineering teams, and it's no wonder that we're ranked #1 CRM by IDC for the ninth year in a row.\nWe're delivering tremendous customer success and continue to gain market share in CRM. Our customer revenue attrition is at its lowest level in our 24-year history. This is a critical metric of all of our customers' success. And we know every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. We have an incredible vision for the future of CRM, a fully integrated suite built on our new Genie Data Cloud and our next-generation platform powered by real-time hyperscale data, AI and automation.\nOur new Data Cloud is the most exciting innovation that we've developed since the original Salesforce clouds and our metadata platform, which we viewed as our first horizon and our second horizon for our technology. [ There ] our third horizon is our data cloud. In this new AI world that we are all now entering, nothing is more important for our customers than our new data cloud, which is rapidly becoming the intelligent heart of their customer engagement.\nData cloud becomes our most important cloud, augmenting every Salesforce cloud and making every part of our Customer 360 more automated, more intelligent and more real time. We just launched Tableau plus Data Cloud natively integrating Tableau with Data Cloud. So every customer can easily visualize, automate, explore and act on their data in real time.\nAnd during the quarter, I was inspired by partnering with Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford on Ford's deployment of Data Cloud. Jim and Ford, while they're leveraging Data Cloud to unify their customer data and deliver personalized real-time customer engagement and dealer focus.\nStarting with their amazing new Mach-E electric Mustang, an amazing car. Ford proactively updates customers about vehicle delivery through both e-mail and SMS with our marketing cloud. I loved getting my text actually, it was amazing. Ford delivers dealers now with leads and intelligent insights to drive faster sales with our Sales Cloud.\nAnd their technicians, well, they're receiving the next best action and technical insights through our Service Cloud. All of this, all of it, it's driven by our data cloud, delivering intelligent, real-time and automated customer engagement from within the Salesforce platform.\nI've also been very inspired by our work with Boston Scientific and their amazing CEO, Michael Mahoney. Our teams were able to use our Data Cloud to create a unified view of their customers. In just 5 months, they were able to bring data from the front office and back office and all of their systems together.\nBoston Scientific's ability to create customer segments using our Marketing Cloud went from 3 to 6 months to nearly real time, and they could deliver next best action insights to their sales teams in the flow of work in Sales Cloud and used our Marketing Cloud to deliver personalized product recommendations on their website in real time. And Boston Scientific as a regulated company, well, with Data Cloud, they're able to easily specify data retention policies for compliance.\nNow as a longtime customer, I'll tell you, Boston Scientific and Michael, well, they've humbled me personally and really humbled all of us at Salesforce with their incredible innovations, their amazing leadership and especially their use of our Data Cloud.\nThis is only the beginning of what's possible. As we build more native automation, intelligence and real-time integration deeper into our Data Cloud and apps, and we're rebalancing our resources to be Data Cloud-first inside our company. And next week, at our TrailheadDX conference in San Francisco on March 7 and 8, you'll see how we're bringing even more innovation through our platform with our new EinsteinGPT technology, the world's first generative AI for CRM, a tremendous complement to our Data Cloud and core Einstein AI platform. EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack.\nAnd then there's another way we're opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customers', as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, I've been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while it's inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldn't be more excited about the future.\nTo wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. We're making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well. You can see it from our numbers by this quarter why I'm so motivated, so inspired and so confident that we can do even more faster than anyone realized.\nNow I'm happy to hand this over to Brian, our Chief Operating Officer; and with Amy, our -- my closest partner in accelerating the transformation. Many of you know Brian and have worked closely with him, and as many global executive roles at Salesforce, Brian has now been with us for more than 23 years, and his employee number lucky 6 -- lucky 13, actually, it's lucky #13, Brian, that's you.\nNo one has had more customer success than you at Salesforce, and I couldn't be more thrilled to have you as our COO. I'm really grateful for your leadership and the success that you're having with your team, and wow, what a great quarter you delivered. Brian, thank you for everything.\nIn closing, I want to thank all of our Ohana, our employees, our customers, our partners and all of our shareholders for another strong quarter. And now, Brian, over to you.\n\nBrian Millham\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Marc. As Marc said, the accelerated transformation to profitable growth we have underway is already having a positive impact as reflected in our strong results in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with how we're improving our execution, delivering customer success in the ongoing measured buying environment.\nAs part of our short-term and long-term restructuring, we've been re-architecting how we go to market in a more efficient, productive, and profitable way. We've reduced the size of the sales and success organization by 10% and are planning further improvements through the work we're doing with Bain.\nWe're also laser-focused on performance, productivity and accountability of all of our teams. We are better aligning incentives with margins, removing layers and increasing spans of control to unleash even higher performance. We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing and G&A.\nWe've learned that we needed to reboot our entire sales enablement process to ensure faster onboarding with reps able to better understand our entire product portfolio and speak the language of our customers in weeks, not months. During the pandemic, we saw productivity drop among our account executives who were working exclusively from home. I believe when our people are together, they're better learners, collaborators and networkers. It also reinforces our performance culture.\nThat's why our sales, success and service teams [ are working from office] or in front of our customers a minimum of 4 days a week. Getting together in person is accelerating enablement and driving our performance and productivity. I'm confident these changes will drive the outcomes that we are all looking for.\nNow before I hand it off to Amy, I'll briefly share some customer highlights from the quarter. We had great customer wins across all products, industries, segments and geographies. We deepened our relationships with Walmart, State Farm, IBM, Siemens, the State of New York, Volkswagen Group, Hitachi and many more leading companies. I'm very proud of our teams that we recorded record low attrition once again this quarter, which is a testament to how our Customer 360 platform is providing the cost savings efficiency and productivity gains our customers need today.\nAs customers are looking to consolidate platforms and reduce complexity, we're seeing many multi-cloud expansions, a key growth strategy for us. Our top 10 wins in the quarter included 5 or more of our cloud. And our top 5 customer wins included 7 or more of our clouds. This is an example of our Customer 360 strategy working.\nWe also continue to see strong momentum from our vertical solutions, which deepened our customer relationships across industries and geographies while accelerating time to value. In the quarter, 8 of our 13 industry clouds grew above 50% ARR, just unbelievable results there. Verticals are a key driver of our growth strategy, and that's why we've amplified them aggressively in this year's V2MOM.\nTableau and MuleSoft and Slack continue to be highly relevant for our customers. And as Marc noted in his comments, they're part of our largest and most strategic deals in the quarter. And we're very proud of the progress we're seeing under the new leadership to more deeply integrate these acquired companies into our core sales and service motions.\nMarc also mentioned Data Cloud. It's going to be an incredible driver of organic growth going forward as these new capabilities are built on the platform and seamlessly integrate into some of our largest clouds, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud. We're seeing many more companies use Data Cloud like Formula 1, American Family Insurance, PGA TOUR Superstore who are using this amazing technology to deliver intelligent, automated, and real-time customer engagement. It is a huge opportunity.\nIn closing, I'm immensely grateful to our customers, our employees and partners and our shareholders for their continued support. We are unwavering in our commitment to deliver customer success and in our transformation to profitable growth.\nNow over to Amy.\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident, Legal, General Counsel and Secretary, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThank you, Brian. It is great to be here today to talk about our financial results and the transformation underway. As we laid out at Investor Day in September, it is a new day for Salesforce. As Marc called out, we are focusing on 4 key areas: short- and long-term expense restructuring; employee productivity; product innovation; and of particular importance to me, continuing to build on our relationships with our shareholders.\nNear our long-term restructuring is absolutely a necessary step to reach our goals. Over the past very intense 90 days since our last earnings call, Marc, Brian and I have spent countless hours together and with our leadership team to ensure our cost restructuring actions accelerate our profitable growth goals. We have already taken a difficult action on decreasing our workforce, and we are consolidating our real estate footprint.\nI want to emphasize that these are just the first steps. As we drive longer-term structural improvements, I look forward to working closely across the company on a comprehensive operating and go-to-market review.\nSince I took on the role of the CFO more than 2 years ago, I've truly enjoyed spending time with and hearing feedback from our shareholders. Just this past quarter, I was able to meet with shareholders extensively, both virtually and in person, in San Francisco, in New York and across Europe. Your feedback has been immensely valuable in helping us shape our transformation. And based on that feedback, I am more confident than ever in our profitable growth framework, disciplined capital allocation strategy, and opportunity to drive shareholder value.\nNow turning to our results for Q4 fiscal year '23, beginning with top line commentary. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $8.38 billion, up 14% year-over-year or 17% in constant currency, with the beat primarily driven by a reignite MuleSoft and Tableau and slight improvement on foreign exchange rates.\nFor the full fiscal year, revenue was $31.4 billion, up 18% or 22% in constant currency. The total foreign exchange headwind for the year was approximately $860 million.\nGeographically, we saw strong new business growth in the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland, while the United States sales environment remained measured. In Q4, the Americas revenue grew 15%; EMEA grew 13% or 20% in constant currency; and APAC grew 18% or 30% in constant currency. From an industry perspective, we saw strong growth in public sector and travel transportation and hospitality, while the financial services and high-tech sectors showed weakness.\nAnd from a product perspective, as mentioned, MuleSoft and Tableau outperformed our expectations, while we continue to see customer spending pressure in both Commerce and Marketing.\nFor revenue attrition, we remain at record lows, ending the quarter below 7.5%, reflecting the value that our services are providing our customers and their customer success.\nNon-GAAP operating margin finished stronger than expected in Q4 at 29.2% and 22.5% for the full fiscal year. The higher-than-expected performance does include some onetime benefits I want to call out. First, there is a restructuring benefit of approximately 1.5 points for Q4. Additionally, in Q4, there were approximately 4.5 points of temporal benefits from license-based revenue performance, annual compensation rationalized for business performance, as well as other onetime efficiencies and savings. Even when normalizing for these benefits, this still represents our highest ever quarterly and annual non-GAAP margin performance.\nQ4 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Q4 free cash flow was $2.6 billion, up 42% year-over-year. For fiscal year '23, operating cash flow was $7.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes a 4-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes that require the capitalization of certain R&D costs.\nFree cash flow finished at $6.3 billion, up 19% year-over-year, driven by strong collections during the final quarter of the year.\nTurning to remaining performance obligation, or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. This ended Q4 at $48.6 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at $24.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant currency. The outperformance was driven by strong go-to-market execution, particularly on early renewals and MuleSoft and some recovery in foreign exchange rates.\nFinally, we continue to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion during the quarter for a total of $4 billion since announcing our first ever share repurchase program in August. This represents more than 60% of free cash flow for fiscal year '23.\nBefore moving to our guidance, I want to briefly discuss the current macro environment. In Q4, we continued to see the measured environment we've called out over the past 2 quarters. This resulted again in elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression. Our guidance assumes these trends persist with no material improvement or deterioration.\nNow to our guidance. Let's start with fiscal year '24. As we've discussed over the last year, Salesforce is deeply committed to structural margin expansion, and we are accelerating on our new day for profitable growth framework. At Dreamforce, we guided to 25% plus margins by FY '26, and we emphasized our ambition to grow margins beyond that content.\nNow for fiscal year '24, we are pleased to share that we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 27%, representing a 4.5 point improvement year-over-year and exceeding our goal by 2 years. And we are just getting started.\nOne item of note, our guidance includes slightly under one half points of benefit due to a depreciation change to the useful life of certain equipment by 1 year effective February 1. For our infrastructure-related equipment, this changed the useful life from approximately 4 to 5 years. And for IT employee equipment, this changed from approximately 3 to 4 years.\nAnd as a general reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are typically in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.\nOn revenue, we are expecting $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion, representing over 10% growth year-over-year and the same in constant currency. On attrition, starting in FY '24, we are including MuleSoft and Tableau in the metric. As a result, attrition is expected to be slightly above 7.5%.\nNext, we are planning for stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue to begin trending lower this year to below 9% in fiscal year '24. This is primarily a result of the decreasing impact from prior M&A as well as adjustments being made to our equity program.\nWe expect fiscal year '24 GAAP EPS of $2.59 to $2.61, including estimated charges for the January restructuring of $0.85. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.12 to $7.14. We expect our fiscal year '24 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 15% to 16%. Important to note, this includes an estimated 14-point headwind related to the restructuring. As a reminder, we will see an increase in our cash taxes in fiscal '24 as we draw down our remaining net operating losses.\nCapEx for the fiscal year is expected to be slightly below 2.5% of revenue. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 16% to 17% for the fiscal year, inclusive of the restructuring charge mentioned above.\nNow to guidance for Q1. On revenue, we expect $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion, growth of approximately 10% or 12% in constant currency. This reflects a $150 million FX headwinds. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.24 to $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.61. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be approximately 11% year-over-year and the same in constant currency. Our guidance continues to incorporate the persistent measured customer buying behavior.\nOn long-term targets, I'd like to provide a few updates. First, with the acceleration on our profitability framework in FY '24, I am very pleased to announce that we now expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margin of at least 30% in Q1 of fiscal year '25. And I want to emphasize that 30% represents a milestone, but not the destination. We are not putting a ceiling on our margin aspirations.\nWe are thrilled that we are exceeding our FY '26 profitability goals years in advance. Note that we are not reiterating our fiscal year '26 revenue target of $50 billion at this time due to the uncertain macro and currency environments that we have discussed. We anticipate having further updates to our long-term plans at our next Investor Day.\nNext, as we continue to focus on shareholder return and disciplined capital allocation, I'd like to share a few additional updates. I'm pleased that the Board has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization from $10 billion to $20 billion. As a result, we now expect to fully offset our stock-based compensation dilution through our share repurchases in fiscal year '24.\nOn M&A, we are confident in our current portfolio and are focused on continued integration of current assets. Reflective of this, you have already heard from Marc that the Board has decided to disband our M&A committee.\nIn closing, I would like to share a deep gratitude for our shareholders, our customers and especially our employees. Our relentless focus on execution and our proactive management in the current environment allowed us to close out a strong quarter and sets us up for a transformational fiscal year '24.\nIt is a new day at Salesforce. And as we look ahead, I'm excited for the opportunity in front of us as we continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value.\nNow Mike, should we open the call up for questions? .\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nGeneral Manager, Investor Relations, Microsoft Corp.\n\nYes, please, Amy. Operator, let's go to questions, please.",

(Operator Instructions) and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speaker's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And now at this time, I'll turn the call over to your speaker, Mr. Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nThank you, Bo. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2023 third quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our website.\nWith me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and Co-CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nAs a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors could affect -- that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including in our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thank you so much, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call. I just want to come back to how great it was to see so many of you at Dreamforce in September. It was really a wonderful experience for me personally. It was our most successful, but I really think it was our most important Dreamforce ever because we were able to come together for what we called our great reunion. And being with you all of you, especially at our IR day, that was a joy for me.\nNow let's get on to the quarter results. We delivered solid revenue growth and profitability in an increasingly challenging environment. You've seen how we're driving customer success, the strength of our organic innovation and this incredible Trailblazers community and how it manifested at the Dreamforce. And everywhere we turned, we saw customers learning how to connect with their customers in entirely new ways and the depth of our Customer 360 platform.\nWe're also thrilled to introduce Genie, which is our Customer Data Cloud, and it's one of the most transformational technologies we have ever delivered. And when you hear some of the metrics already coming out of customer adoption with Genie, I think that you'll be incredibly impressed, and I can't wait for Bret to talk about that.\nThe best part of Dreamforce is being together. That was what it was all about for me, and I'm sure it was for you as well, and the 40,000 folks that all came to San Francisco to have this incredible experience and all the additional folks that joined us online.\nNow let's get to our results. Revenue in the quarter, well, it was $7.84 billion. That's up 14% year-over-year. I think that's a record for us. And also, it was 19% in constant currency. And we're going to talk about that foreign exchange situation in just a second. We closed some amazing deals in the quarter with great companies like Bank of America, RBC Wealth Management and Dell and other great stories, and I'm also going to get that into a moment as well. And even with purchase decisions receiving greater scrutiny, we continue to gain market share and close marquee transactions.\nIDC recently ranked Salesforce as the #1 in CRM. And now we've done that for 9 years in a row. And I'm proud that we've delivered revenue growth in this environment, but especially proud of the team for our continued focus on delivering record operating margins. And here, you can see now, up 22.7% non-GAAP operating margin we delivered for the quarter. And I think when I look back at various financial crisis, as we think back even, I think, to '08, '09, I think it was like somewhere down to 10%. So we've come a long way in a short period of time.\nSo this quarter has been further proof of our commitment to profitable growth, continuing our operating margin growth, continued focus on our revenue growth, continued focus on our market share growth. And a great evidence of that is our remaining performance obligation. Our RPO is now an incredible $40 billion. Now as I've said in the last few quarters, the dollar had a strong quarter, maybe even a stronger quarter than we had. I think that when we first said that, in the second quarter, folks didn't really understand what we were talking about, or maybe it was in the first quarter we said that.\nI remember it was a trip to Japan when I called Amy and I was asking her what the expectations were for revenue. But when I told her what my guidance was for what and how I was looking at revenue, including foreign exchange, I don't think either one of us could believe what was really happening, and now we've really seen it start to play out.\nWe continue to see the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. And of course, that is our biggest surprise of the year. In the quarter, we saw $300 million year-over-year headwinds to revenue, and we've expected a total of $900 million for the full year. Now that is something we just could not have expected a year ago, and that is when we initiated our revenue guidance. At Dreamforce and in my travels around the world, our customers have been asking how to best navigate this economic situation with the high level of market volatility and uncertainty.\nA lot of CEOs have never been through these types of crises before. They haven't seen these kind of variations in the market or in foreign exchange or even in market demand. Well, we've got a lot to say about that because this is not our first financial crisis. And I'm seeing a lot of buying behavior that really reflects a lot of what we've seen during other crises, whether it's '08, '09 or even '01.\nAnd obviously, the current economic situation is nowhere near as severe as what happened beginning in '08, but there are some patterns that we've seen repeat themselves. And in early '08, we saw customers who were reluctant to expand distribution capacity, they weren't adding service people, they froze their hiring, they initiated headcount reductions. We saw those occur that year. We saw that in '11 as well. I think that maybe when things start to get a little tough or when the stock market shifts, that's when CEOs say, hold on, should we be expanding distribution capacity right now? Should we be expanding service capacity?\nWhat do we stop -- let's stop our advertising, let's stop our marketing spend, things that they can immediately take actions on. Well, you couple that with foreign exchange headwinds have become an issue and everyone was shifting their focus to finding efficiencies, reducing their costs, increasing productivity, and again, we're feeling all of this once again. And that led us to the shift of the company. It took us a lot to how we operate and where we are investing our dollars. We've actually developed our own playbook.\nWe really wrote it all down. We talked about what was happening. We knew what happened again. And we had to dust off some of those plans and numbers from 12, 13 years ago from 22 years ago. And we've turned that playbook into gaining market share and focusing on operational discipline and operational excellence, especially in the face of economic headwinds.\nAnd as the economy has started to recover, whether it's in 2010 or even in 2002, we were able to radically accelerate our growth. I have to tell you, when we went back as a team and we looked at the numbers, even I was really shocked to see kind of how things changed, some of the decisions that we made, but then how we all of a sudden were able to navigate so well, and use that as an opportunity to adjust the company in all -- in a number of really critical and strategic areas.\nNow I've always believed since that point, especially, that an economic crisis creates these opportunities, and we're squarely in that moment, and we've acted. Starting in July of this year, the buying environment became more measured and foreign exchange headwinds were becoming increasingly complex. We told you then we didn't believe this challenging macro environment was going to be a short-term problem. And you know we're not economists. You know that we don't know exactly what is happening or when the recovery will happen, et cetera, but we do see a lot, and I think we understand a lot about what's going on because we have such strong global data.\nAnd we're not assuming that this economy gets any better anytime soon. We're just reporting what we see with our customers, the kind of changes they make when they start to feel these headwinds. We're following our playbook to make sure it works well positioned to gain market share, to increase our profitability, to focus on our operating margin, to focus on the growth of our revenue and be able to continue to invest, especially when the economy recovers.\nNow for this fiscal year, we're maintaining our revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. And you saw that, that also included that incremental foreign exchange headwind, and it's even an expected incremental $100 million of foreign exchange headwind just since last quarter. We're raising our fiscal year '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance from 20.4% to 20.7%, an expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year, and I expect a lot more, especially with this increased focus we have on expanding our operating margin.\nSalesforce is mission-critical to nearly every Fortune 1000 company because every company is becoming a customer company. And everyone knows that this is the time during a crisis like this that you need to focus on your customers. If you need to do one thing, if there's one critical thing that every company has to do to get through this, is to make sure they maintain their relationships with their customers. It's a critical part of navigating through this time, and you're not going to be successful if you don't stay connected with your customers.\nWe're signing transformational deals with major brands as every industry continues to digitally transform and that continues to be perhaps the most important initiative of every company, regardless of the economic situation. When you look at this by industry, it's slightly different for each industry.\nIn telecom. We're working with almost every major player as they transform how they connect with their customers. All telcos must deliver faster, better service to customers, keeping their costs down, focusing on their NPS score, becoming more competitive. We all know that. It's a highly competitive industry. We all understand the dynamics well. It's one of the reasons why we've done so well in all these global telecom companies.\nBut I really want to talk to you about a great example, and this deal that we signed with T-Mobile in the quarter. Now we've done a lot of work with Mike and with T-Mobile over the years, and it's been very exciting to see how they built their company and especially how they've executed the merger -- and now they have a amazing transformational opportunity and how they work with businesses, and we're working with them to develop a vision for the next-generation user experience for T-Mobile for Business. And our professional services team is leading that charge.\nFinancial Services, well, that's another industry that's been going through one of the most incredible digital transformations, but it's an incredible moment for them, actually. It's why we're working with all the major financial service companies to drive stronger client relationships and to unite their teams to be more effective, especially in this environment. It's a golden time for financial services in many ways. A great example is Bank of America, who I think has been a customer for more than 20 years, and we've been with them through many different financial crises.\nBut in a short amount of time, they've increased productivity and reduced their technical debt. They're saving time and money, they're connecting with their customers in new ways. It's a tremendous relationship with BofA to become their CRM standard. We're delighted to have such great success with them over many decades and to expand this relationship to the business bank, to the corporate bank and the investment bank, it's really an expansion.\nAnd I just want to thank Brian for his tremendous loyalty, but also his partnership over so many decades, and it's just a great organization to work with every single day.\nWell, before I go on, first of all, I want to give you an invitation. I hope that you'll all plan to join us in New York City next week, where we're going to host our Salesforce world tour on December 8. Join us in person or online, where we're going to announce some new innovations. And you're going to hear from our incredible customers and so much more.\nNow before I end, I have to say something, and it's something that I did not want to say ever, and I'm extremely sad to tell you that Bret Taylor is going to be leaving the company. Bret and I are like brothers. I love him very deeply. He's an incredible person. And one of the great joys of my company has been having him here. And I'll tell you, for me, this has been a feeling of tremendous loss. I'm experiencing that right now. You can probably hear it in my voice. It makes me think of all the great people that we have actually lost in the company over the time as well, so many great leaders of our industry, but especially now with Bret.\nThis is just really hard for me, and I'm extremely sad to see him go. I know he has created 2 great companies. I know he wants to go create a third great company. And you can't keep a wild tiger in a cage. And we got to let them be free and let him go, and I understand, but I don't like it. And Bret, you know that you're always going to be our brother. You know that you -- we love you very deeply, that you have a home here. We're going to try to get you back somehow. So don't think that you're going to somehow get out of this alive, because you're not. And you're always going to be part of our Ohana. And we are really upset about this, and it's going to be a difficult moment for us.\nBut I know that you're going to be with us through the end of the year, and I know you're going to continue to work with us even after this point. But Bret, we love you, and we're so sorry to see you leave the company at the end of this year.\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThank you, Marc. It's hard to follow that and trying to keep my composure as well. I just want to start, Marc, by just expressing how deeply grateful I am to you. And just as importantly, the entire Salesforce team. For the past 6-plus years, I just couldn't have imagined it when I joined the company. I could not be more proud of the trust, innovation and customer success we've delivered in my time here, particularly over the past few years. I think this amazing community has helped every organization in the world to remain connected to their customers amidst a public health crisis, the economic turmoil, this global pandemic. It's just incredible, and I'm incredibly grateful.\nAnd Marc, you personally, you've been my mentor long before I joined this company. And in the past 6 years, your relationship has definitely become the most significant in my professional career. I would not be the leader I am today without you, and I cannot thank you enough for our friendship and our partnership.\nThe past few years have been tumultuous for all of us, and I've recently been reflecting what's been truly important to me. And while there is absolutely no easy time for a transition like this, I really do feel that now is the right time for me to return to my entrepreneurial roots, particularly given the technology landscape and the economy going through such tectonic shifts. Salesforce has never been stronger, and I've never been more confident in the future of the company. And as Marc said, I will remain as co-CEO through the end of the fiscal year, not only to ensure a smooth transition, but most importantly, to ensure that we have a strong close to the quarter and a strong close to the fiscal year.\nAnd as Marc said, even after this transition, I will always, always be a part of this company and always be a part of this community. As Marc said, we had a solid quarter, top -- double-digit top and bottom line performance, demonstrating the strength of our business model and our commitment to operating with discipline and delivering profitable growth at scale. We continue to deliver on organic innovation, and our product portfolio is strategically positioned, mission-critical and highly differentiated.\nOur ecosystem and our app exchange marketplace are unparalleled in the industry. And as Marc mentioned, as you saw at Dreamforce, our innovation engine is in overdrive, with Genie, Slack Canvas, Net Zero marketplace and more, building on our position as a leader in nearly every CRM category.\nGenie, in particular, makes every part of our Customer 360 platform more automated, intelligent and real time, driving faster time to value for our customers. And the adoption of Genie by our customers, particularly this past Cyber week, has exceeded all of our expectations. The Genie Customer Data Cloud is already processing literally over 100 billion customer records on average every single day. During Cyber Week alone, Genie ingested an astonishing 1.1 trillion records and enabled 43 billion consumer engagements for our customers.\nInter, a leading digital banking service company in Brazil, is a great example of Genie's power. Inter was able to consolidate 6 data systems into 1, and they are converting 35x more customers with Genie. Like Marc, I met with hundreds of CEOs across every industry over the last few months. In this buying environment, our customers are increasingly focused on 3 things. First is time to value.\nOur customers need to quickly get the benefits of their technology investments. Second is ensuring these digital transformation projects drive cost savings in addition to customer satisfaction and top line growth. And third, we know our customers need to consolidate their platforms and vendor relationships to reduce complexity and risk and to drive efficiency. We are delivering on all 3 at scale today for our customers.\nOur customers are seeing on average an estimated 25% in savings in their IT costs and 26% increase in employee productivity using Salesforce according to a recent survey of more than 3,500 of our customers. RBC Wealth Management is a great example. RBC is onboarding new customers in minutes instead of days, and they've consolidated over 26 technology systems into 1 using our Customer 360 platform, decreasing their maintenance costs by 50%. Despite the economic headwinds that Marc mentioned, we had record low revenue attrition again this quarter, which is a testament to just how mission-critical Salesforce is to our customers, especially in this environment.\nWe also launched new product bundles for sales, service, marketing and analytics. These product bundles are enabling our customers to consolidate their tools on Salesforce, driving efficient growth. We're also closing transformational deals and multi-cloud expansions. This quarter, 7 of our top 10 deals included 5 or more of our clouds.\nNow let's turn to the cloud performance. Sales Cloud, our flagship, continues to drive sales productivity for the world's most important brands. Sales Cloud grew 12% year-over-year, a healthy 17% in constant currency, including great customer wins at companies like Bolt, Snowflake and Thermo Fisher. Service Cloud continues to help our customers deliver exceptional customer service experiences and reduce their customer service costs. Service Cloud grew 12% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency, approaching $2 billion in revenue for the quarter. With wins at Carl Zeiss, Dell and Fujitsu.\nOur Marketing and Commerce Clouds power the digital customer experiences for the world's greatest retailers and [browns] around the world, and together grew 12% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency, thanks to wins at companies like Banco Bradesco, Hugo Boss and Saks.\nWe just passed Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and I wanted to express my gratitude to our engineering teams. Our engineering teams again delivered unparalleled mission-critical reliability and scale to retailers around the world. Even lapping the pandemic, the sales process for our Commerce Cloud in Cyber Week increased 11% year-over-year. And our Marketing Cloud delivered nearly 49 billion messages in Cyber Week alone, up 21% year-over-year. We've now sent 1.4 trillion messages from our Marketing Cloud so far this year, just incredible.\nOur platform business, which includes Slack, grew 18% or 22% in constant currency, highlighted by wins at Japan Airlines, WorkSafe Victoria and Zoom. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now generating 194 billion predictions every single day across the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, up 57% year-over-year. And Slack, which now powers collaboration and workflows across the entire Customer 360, grew 46% year-over-year. Slack is now handling more than 2.6 billion actions every single day and had great wins this quarter with companies like Rivian and Verizon.\nData, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, continues to be core to every digital transformation at every single one of our customers. Data grew 13% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. We're seeing strong demand from MuleSoft, which reaccelerated in the quarter to 19% year-over-year growth or 23% in constant currency, with wins at brands like Western Union, SmileDirectClub and Kona.\nIntegration transactions on the MuleSoft platform grew to $6.7 billion per day, up 33% year-over-year. Tableau grew at 8% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency, with wins in the quarter at Inter and McLaren Racing.\nAs a reminder, due to the way we recognize revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau, when the macro environment is difficult, we typically see the effects earlier and more pronounced in these businesses. We're confident in the opportunity ahead for Tableau, and we recently made changes to reaccelerate Tableau growth. This includes new leadership, and as importantly, new product integrations like revenue intelligence, a deep integration between Sales Cloud and Tableau that has become one of our fastest-growing add-on products.\nAnd finally, as we mention every quarter, our industry solutions continued to be a strength in our portfolio, with out-of-the-box processes that enable our customers to achieve faster time to value and lower implementation costs. Even with the many successes in the quarter, we expect this increasingly challenging [buying] environment to continue next year. I'm confident that Salesforce has never been more mission critical to our customers in this environment.\nAnd to wrap, I'm so grateful for our employees, our [18 million] Trailblazers, and all of our customers and partners for helping lead the way with innovation, agility and resilience to navigate in these times. And before I pass it to you, Amy, I just wanted to express my personal gratitude to you. As I became the first-time CEO and you became a first-time CFO navigating the company and navigating our customers through these crises, I'm so grateful for our relationship and for everything this company has done for me.\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident & CFO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nGreat. Bret, thank you so much. And let me just start by saying to you, it has truly been a joy to work with you for the last 6 years. I am going to miss you terribly, but I'm also equally excited for you on your next steps, and I know there will be incredible success again.\nSo taking a sharp left turn to our results here. I am pleased to report another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Despite increasing macro pressure, revenue grew nearly 20% in constant currency. And as we discussed at our Investor Day in September, it's a new day for profitability. I'm very proud of our Salesforce team and all of our employees for generating record operating margin during Q3.\nReiterating Marc's comments, profitable growth is a major focus as we lean in on best-in-class operational excellence across all aspects of our business. As customers focus on optimizing time to value, driving cost savings and consolidating platforms and vendor relationships, we remain well positioned to support them through the current economic environment.\nNow to our results for Q3 fiscal year '23. I'll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was $7.84 billion, up 14% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind to our results, as the dollar further strengthened throughout the quarter. For Q3, the total FX impact was $300 million, approximately $50 million more than we had forecast.\nA few highlights from the quarter. Again, as we outlined at Investor Day, we have 3 balanced growth pillars: Customer 360 Advantage, industry solutions and geographical expansion. All of these continued to reflect the growing adoption of our portfolio across our customer base. First, multi-cloud adoption by our customer base continues. Customers with 5 or more clouds increased ARR by over 20%.\nSecond, our industry solution continues to be a strong tailwind to our revenue growth. Seven of our 13 industry clouds grew ARR above 50% this quarter. In some of the highest performing industries, clouds in the quarter included energy and utilities, manufacturing and our recently announced Automotive Cloud.\nFinally, from a geographical perspective, Americas grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew 10%, 23% in constant currency, and APAC grew 14%, which is 30% in constant currency. And as you have heard, revenue attrition in Q3 was again below 7.5%, reflecting the value that our services are providing to the customer base in this tough operating environment.\nQ3 non-GAAP operating margin was a strong 22.7%, driven by our ongoing focus on disciplined execution, our hiring slowdown and resource prioritization. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.21 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.40. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments increased GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02.\nOperating cash flow was $313 million in Q3, down 23% year-over-year. CapEx was $198 million, resulting in free cash flow of $115 million, down 52% year-over-year, both driven by lower billings.\nTurning to remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract. RPO ended Q3 at approximately $40 billion, up 10% year-over-year.\nCurrent remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $20.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency. This includes 1 point of incremental FX headwinds beyond our Q3 guidance.\nAnd finally, Q3 was a milestone quarter for Salesforce. After announcing our first ever share repurchase program on the last earnings call, I am pleased to share that we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders during Q3.\nBefore moving to our guidance, I'd like to comment on the current economic environment. You recall that last quarter, we noted measured customer buying behavior really beginning in July. This led to elongated sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression, particularly in enterprise.\nAs Q3 progressed, we saw an even more challenging buying environment, driving intense customer scrutiny on every investment dollar to ensure the highest return possible. During Q3, this behavior was most pronounced in our U.S. and major European markets, while Japan remained more resilient. From an industry perspective, the most impacted were retail, consumer goods and communications and media, while the more resilient were travel and hospitality, manufacturing, automotive and energy. And from a product perspective, we continue to see customer spending pressure in commerce and marketing.\nNow to our guidance. First, on revenue, we are pleased to maintain our fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $30.9 billion to $31 billion. representing 17% growth year-over-year or 20% in constant currency despite an incremental $100 million FX headwind since our last call. This raises the total year-over-year FX headwind to $900 million.\nIn addition, our guidance includes Slack at slightly above $1.5 billion. As you've already heard, we are deeply committed to expanding our profitability over the long term. I am proud that we are raising our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 20.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. And this guidance also includes approximately 75 basis points of headwind from Slack.\nAs a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.35 to $1.37. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.92 to $4.94. CRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 7% year-over-year or [10%] in constant currency. This guidance continues to incorporate the more challenging trends in our customer behavior, as previously discussed.\nWe now expect our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance to be approximately 16%, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance, driven by lower billings. This includes a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs.\nWe now expect CapEx to be approximately 2.5% of revenue for the fiscal year. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 17% for the fiscal year.\nBefore I close, I'd like to share a few thoughts on fiscal year '24. As discussed, we are experiencing a very unpredictable macro environment as our customers are working to ensure their businesses are also healthy for the long term. Compounding that dynamic is an unprecedented foreign currency market. Therefore, at this time, we believe it would be premature to provide revenue guidance for the next fiscal year.\nNow in terms of operating margin, we are driving operating discipline and following our playbook that Marc discussed to ensure that we are consistently expanding our operating margin in the face of top line headwinds. And as the leadership team, we're continuing to take a hard look at our cost structure. This is all part of our playbook, and we will continue to take steps that drive profitable growth. Of note, we intend to provide full FY '24 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nSo to close, we are helping our customers navigate the current macro environment by bringing much needed efficiencies to their digital strategy with a compelling value case. Our commitment to disciplined decision-making is unwavering, and we are marching towards our fiscal '26 target of at least 25% non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of any capital allocation decision.\nAnd as our business grows, we will continue to target returning on average 30% to 40% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders.\nNow, Mike, should we open up the call for questions?\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nThat's good. Thank you, Amy. Bo, we'll go to Q&A and we'll take the first question.",

(Operator Instructions).\nI would like to hand over the conference to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMichael Spencer\n\nThank you, Emma, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our fiscal 2023 second quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor.\nWith me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and Co-CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; and Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer. We'll also be joined by Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\nAs a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions, which could change.\nShould any of these risks materialize or should assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks and uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nWell, hey, thanks, Mike. And thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. As you saw in the results for the quarter, we've delivered really strong revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, showing yet again the resilience and durability of our business model in this economic environment.\nRevenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year or 26% growth in constant currency. We had a great quarter, but yet again, the dollar had an even stronger quarter, and we continue to see the impact on foreign exchange and currency fluctuation on our financials. For Q2, we saw approximately $250 million of headwind to revenue, which is roughly $50 million more than we assumed in our guide last quarter, and we now expect a total of $800 million foreign exchange headwind year-over-year for the full fiscal year. Operating margin in the quarter was 19.9%, and we delivered $334 million in operating cash flow. Our remaining performance obligation or the total undelivered contract value that we have with our customers is really an incredible $41.6 billion, and this is revenue signed. It's not yet recognized.\nNow turning to guidance. Over the last few months, I've met with hundreds of CEOs, with economists, business leaders, political leaders and other experts about their business and where they see this global economy heading. And I don't think it's going to surprise anyone, everyone has got a slightly different answer. And it doesn't matter who you speak to, could be a different geography, a different position, everybody sees things at a slightly different way right now. But what we do know and what I think everyone will agree on is that digital transformation remains the #1 priority for CEOs and that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer.\nThat's what continues to drive our business forward, and it's why Salesforce is the #1 CRM by market share globally, according to the IDC Software Tracker. Now for those of you who have been on these calls with us, we've all been through a number of these economic cycles. And we've especially seen that over our last 23 years. And once like this come around, we see customers becoming more measured in the way they buy. Sales cycles can get stretched. Deals are inspected by higher levels of management, and all of this, we began to start to see in July.\nNearly everyone I've talked to is taking a more measured approach to their business. We expect these trends to continue in the near term, and we reflected this in our guidance. Given the significant impact of foreign exchange and buyers being more measured, we're revising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance to $30.9 billion to $31 billion or about 17% growth year-over-year or 20% in constant currency. At the same time, we're maintaining our fiscal year '23 operating margin guide of 20.4%, an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year. This is further evidence that we remain deeply committed to consistent, disciplined margin, cash flow and revenue growth as part of our long-term plan to drive both top and bottom line performance. We have the right team, the right products, the right playbook for getting to $50 billion in revenue in fiscal year '26.\nWe always get questions about our M&A strategy and what company we're going to acquire next and what we're going to do next from an acquisition cycle. I think we get this question every single earnings call that we do like this. And it's always one of my favorite parts of the call. And I'm excited to tell you we have found a great cloud company, growing revenue for 73 consecutive quarters through every economic cycle. It's got great cash flow, #1 market share, an incredible brand, one of the most admired companies in the world, great values, fantastic community of 17 million Trailblazers, fantastic commitment to its community, runs across 90 countries. And that company is Salesforce.\nWe're thrilled that our Board of Directors has authorized up to $10 billion in our first-ever share repurchase. This reflects the confidence we have in our business and in our approach to generating shareholder value. Brian Millham is going to expand in more detail about the broader capital allocation strategy in a moment. And you'll also hear about some amazing customer wins in the quarter. I'm especially proud of a major deal we closed in the quarter with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and it's one of our most meaningful partnerships. The VA is a relationship that we've been building for over 6 years, and now Salesforce is becoming the digital front door for our veterans and their families. We can't be more proud to do our part in helping those who have made sacrifices in serving the nation.\nIt's been an incredible year so far being able to connect with our customers in person again, has been just amazing. We've done 63 marketing events so far this year, hosting over 250,000 Trailblazers and counting. But none is more exciting on every level than Dreamforce. And we're hoping to see all of you as we celebrate our 20th Dreamforce, September 20th through the 22nd right here in San Francisco. It's a celebration of our Trailblazers, and we're going to expect 150,000 people to be here and registered to attend. And we'll also be streaming the entire 3 days on Salesforce+ and expect millions more to tune in. We have an amazing line of product announcements and innovations and speakers and giving back. It's going to be a big Dreamforce. It's going to be really the biggest Dreamforce ever, our 20th ever Dreamforce.\nAnd we're also going to be celebrating the impact Salesforce has had through our 1-1-1 philanthropic model as we've now surpassed over $0.5 billion in grants, 7 million hours of volunteerism, and more than 50,000 nonprofits using Salesforce for free. At Dreamforce, the amazing Red Hot Chili Peppers, that's Anthony and his entire band, playing to everyone. They're going to be performing at our annual benefit concert with 100% of the proceeds going to our children's hospitals right here in San Francisco and in Oakland. So please tell your friends, tell your firms, tell your vendors, tell everybody to get sponsorships to Dreamfest because it's going to be incredible. And of course, you're all invited to our Investor Day during Dreamforce on September 21.\nAmy, are they invested even if they don't do the Dreamfest sponsorship?\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident & CFO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nYes, Marc, they are invited.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nAll right. Look, you're not going to want to miss it. Look, before handing off to Bret, I'd like to congratulate Brian Millham, our new Chief Operating Officer. Brian is employee #13 and has been helping us to build this company from its earlier days.\nAs Chief Operating Officer, Brian is going to continue to lead our customer success organization and now adds global sales to his responsibilities. Bringing our incredible customer success ecosystem, Sales Cloud sales even closer under Brian will help us to deliver the full power of Salesforce to every one of our customers in the new economy. And we're so fortunate that Gavin Patterson has taken on this important new role as Chief Strategy Officer, helping us to guide our strategic direction. And thank you and congratulations to Gavin. I'm so grateful to Gavin who for the last 2 years during the pandemic has overseen one of Salesforce's most rapid growth periods in Salesforce's history.\nWhen I look back at the last 3 years, I saw it was really only 2 years ago, in fiscal year '21, when we did, proud, I think it was about $5.1 million -- is that -- $5.1 billion. Is that right, Mike, something like that? And then last year, I think for Q2, we did something like $6.3 billion, and now we're doing $7.7 billion, if I get the numbers right. I mean it's an incredible trajectory of growth from over the last 24 months. And I couldn't be more proud of Gavin to help us during that period and now, Brian, in your COO role. Congratulations to Brian and Gavin.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bret.\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. And congratulations, Brian and Gavin. As Marc said, we had another strong quarter delivering strong top and bottom line performance. Our results demonstrate the durability of our business model and the strength of our strategy. Our Customer 360 product portfolio is the industry standard and the market leader, a leader in 12 current Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. And the platform is helping hundreds of thousands of companies in every industry digitally transform.\nOur technology is also deeply differentiated. Einstein Artificial Intelligence platform is now doing over 175 billion predictions every day. Just incredible. Our go-to-market capability is also unmatched in the industry. The diversity of the industries, regions and lines of business we serve has driven the durability and resilience Marc talked about and you've seen in our business over the past 23 years. And finally, our ecosystem is unparalleled in enterprise software. As 150,000 Trailblazers joined us for Dreamforce next month, they represent a global community of developers, administrators and ISVs, 17 million strong that are driving what IDC estimates to be $1.6 trillion in new business revenues by 2026.\nAs you heard from Marc, we're in a more measured buying environment. Executive teams are scrutinizing all purchasing decisions, and we are seeing some deals take longer to close. I personally met with over 100 CEOs this quarter in my travels across Latin America, Europe and North America, and digital transformation remains their top priority. But the focus of the conversation has shifted meaningfully towards productivity, efficiency and time to value.\nIn this environment, our Customer 360 portfolio is uniquely positioned to enable our customers to deliver both growth and cost savings. And you can see it in this quarter's results. Sales Cloud revenue grew 15% year-over-year, a healthy 19% in constant currency, including customer wins at CDW, Zscaler and Schneider Electric. Using our Sales Cloud and CRM analytics, Schneider reduced their close time by 30%. And with MuleSoft, they saved 40,000 hours of employees' time and saved $2.7 million in IT costs.\nService Cloud grew 14% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency, including customer wins at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Workday and Uber. Our digital service product line, in particular, accelerated as customers pivoted their spend to digital technologies that reduce customer service costs. Uber Eats is a great example. Uber Eats saw a 20% improvement in productivity across e-mail, chat and phone support channels with our Service Cloud, and more importantly, with their investment in our Einstein AI chat bots, they improved their call deflection by 30%. Our Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew together 17% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency, including significant expansion of our relationships with Live Nation, L'Oreal and Tapestry.\nIn our Commerce Cloud, we are seeing GMV growth decelerate in line with the rest of the e-commerce industry as consumers settle back down to pre-pandemic norms. Platform, including Slack, grew 53% or 56% in constant currency, including great Slack expansions at organizations like the National Weather Service, Coursera and Mercado Libre. The National Weather Service selected Slack as its platform to connect over 4,300 employees with emergency managers, public safety decision-makers and local media partners nationwide. I'm also excited to say that we will have over 12 Slack product integrations with our Customer 360 platform live and generally available by Dreamforce, where we have an incredible opportunity to help every one of our customers build their digital HQ and Slack in this new era of flexible work.\nData, which includes MuleSoft and Tableau, grew 12% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency with wins at brands like Atlassian, Siemens Energy, CBRE Group and King Power, which is Thailand's leading travel retailer. I'm heartened by the progress we're seeing in our go-to-market transformation of MuleSoft. We are on track to have MuleSoft return to be in a tailwind for revenue growth in the back half of the year.\nAnd finally, our 12 industry clouds were another bright spot in the quarter, growing faster than our line of business cloud as our customers are increasingly focused on time to value and reducing their implementation costs. The out-of-the-box industry processes we've built into our industry clouds are a compelling value proposition in this more measured buying environment, and I'm excited about the new processes we brought to market in the first half of the year, including trade promotion management for consumer goods and our virtual assistant for our Financial Services Cloud.\nAs we head towards Dreamforce, our pace of organic innovation has never been stronger. In our summer release alone, we delivered key innovation like revenue intelligence for predictive forecasting, the ability to talk to your data through Tableau, MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation and a new lakehouse architecture for our customer data platform. And just this week, we launched Salesforce Easy, a new all-in-one self-service suite for sales, marketing, service and commerce that is going to transform how small businesses engage with Salesforce.\nAs you'll hear more from Amy, we're committed to durable growth at scale. We're committed to our 20.4% operating margin this year, and I'm excited that we're announcing our first-ever $10 billion share repurchase program today.\nOur capital allocation strategy is simple. We will continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We will invest in our organic innovation. We will reduce the impact of dilution, both by offsetting stock-based compensation and by maintaining a healthy balance sheet to fund any future M&A. I'm so grateful to our 17 million Trailblazers, all of our partners and most importantly, our employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation, agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times.\nNow over to Amy to discuss the financial details of the quarter.\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident & CFO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bret, and congratulations, Brian.\nI'm pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results for Q4 -- Q2. That is pleased to report strong top and bottom line financial results in Q2. As you've heard from Marc and Bret, our diversified portfolio remains well positioned to help our customers both grow and drive efficiencies in their business. Our customers are relying on us more than ever to be their trusted adviser, partnering with them on their digital road map.\nNow let me walk through our results for Q2 of fiscal '23, beginning with top line commentary. Total revenue for the second quarter was $7.72 billion, up 22% year-over-year or 26% in constant currency. FX continued to represent a headwind as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. In Q2, the headwind from FX was about $50 million more than we had guided.\nA few highlights from the quarter. Sales Cloud continues to be a critical piece of our customers' success, helping companies drive more productive growth. In Q2, Sales Cloud grew 15% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. Service Cloud grew 14% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency as we help our customers realize efficiencies and cost savings. As customers focus on their digital strategy and transformation, we continue to see growing multi-cloud adoption due to the number of customers who have purchased 5 or more clouds, again grew in double digits. And Slack continued to outperform our revenue expectations with revenue of $381 million. Slack continues to gain traction with customers. And in Q2, 7 of our top 10 deals included Slack. And for the fifth consecutive quarter, the number of customers spending greater than $100,000 with Slack, grew by more than 40% year-over-year.\nNow for a quick update on data. I'm pleased to say that data passed $1 billion of revenue this quarter. And with that, all of our 5 clouds are now generating more than $1 billion in revenue a quarter. Data growth of 12% or 13% in constant currency was driven by MuleSoft total revenue growth of 15% and Tableau growth of 9%. As a reminder, approximately half of MuleSoft and Tableau's total contract value is recognized in period, resulting in more quarterly volatility than our other core products.\nTurning to revenue attrition. Rates remain at record lows, ending Q2 at approximately 7.5%. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9%, driven by our continued focus on disciplined decision-making and prioritization. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.07 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. Mark-to-market accounting of the company's strategic investments benefited GAAP EPS by $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS by $0.04. Operating cash flow was $334 million in Q2, down 13% year-over-year. CapEx was $203 million, resulting in free cash flow of $131 million, down 24% year-over-year.\nNow before getting to our RPO performance and guidance, I'd like to address the current economic environment. As both Marc and Bret mentioned, we started to see more measured buying behavior from our customers, which began in the last month of the quarter. This resulted in stretched sales cycles, additional deal approval layers and deal compression. In addition, we saw slowing in our create and close, Slack self-serve and SMB businesses, which tend to be leading macro indicators. Geographically, this behavior was most pronounced in North America and major European markets, while Japan was relatively more resilient. From an industry perspective, retail, consumer goods and communications and media were the most impacted, while high tech, energy and financial services stayed more consistent during the quarter. And from a product perspective, commerce and marketing saw more pronounced decelerations, while sales and service remains strong.\nTurning to remaining performance obligation, or RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. It ended Q2 at approximately $41.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $21.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. This includes 1 point of incremental FX headwind beyond our Q2 guidance.\nMoving to Q3 guidance. We expect revenue of $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion, or approximately 14% growth year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This reflects a $250 million FX headwind. We also expect the $380 million contribution from Slack. As a reminder, Q3 represents the fifth quarter of Slack contributions to revenue. Therefore, the year-over-year growth rates will be normalized. CRPO growth is expected to be approximately 12% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. And we expect GAAP EPS of $0.09 to $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 to $1.21.\nNow turning to our full year fiscal '23 guidance. We are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $30.9 billion to $31.0 billion or approximately 17% growth year-over-year, 20% in constant currency. This incorporates the trends in customer behavior that we saw beginning in July. The total year-over-year FX headwind is now $800 million, an incremental $200 million year-over-year since our previous guidance. As a reminder, the currencies most impacting our revenue are the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar.\nOur guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack. As a company, we remain committed to profitability over the long term. And while we see a more deliberate customer buying behavior, I am pleased to hold our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance at 20.4%, an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. This margin guidance includes roughly 100 basis points of headwind from Slack. As a reminder, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural FX hedge in our operating margin.\nFor the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 to $4.73. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio. We are updating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance to approximately 16% to 17% growth year-over-year. Our guidance continues to assume a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. We expect CapEx to be slightly above 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, a nominal increase over last quarter's guide, reflecting the revised full year revenue guidance. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the fiscal year.\nSo to close, as our customers and their executive teams, including the CEO, CIO and CFO, focus on their digital investment strategy, we are well positioned with our diversified product portfolio to help drive efficiencies and growth. And we are laser-focused on disciplined decision-making with a commitment to achieving our operating margin guidance. Lastly, let me echo Bret and Marc. We are very, very pleased to be announcing our new share repurchase program today. This step is a reflection of the confidence that we have in the future of Salesforce. And I look forward to seeing everyone at Investor Day on September 21, where we will go into even more detail on our capital allocation strategy.\nNow Emma, let's open up the call for questions.",

Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2023 first quarter results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor.\nWith me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and Co-CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer; and Gavin Patterson, Chief Revenue Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release.\nSome of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, included in our most recent report on Form 10-K.\nBefore I hand the call over to Marc, I'm excited to welcome Mike Spencer to Salesforce. As many of you know, I will be taking on a new role here at Salesforce, supporting strategic planning in our product organization, and Mike has joined Salesforce to lead Investor Relations. Mike is familiar to many of you as he previously led Investor Relations at Microsoft. Thank you, Marc, Bret, Amy, Gavin for allowing meaningful rotations that enable career development. It is one of the many benefits of working at Salesforce. And thank you to the investment community for welcoming me over 2 years ago. Leading IR has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my career.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks so much, Evan, and congratulations on your promotion. It's so well deserved. You've done a phenomenal job in the last few years, and we're also thrilled for you. And thank you for agreeing to take on this incredible new role at Salesforce and leading the teams, and we could not be more excited for you.\nAnd we cannot be more excited to welcome Mike Spencer to Salesforce. I know that many of the folks on this call have worked with Mike before, should be a familiar voice and friend, and I'm looking forward to working closely with Mike. And Mike is going to be based out of our Atlanta headquarters. And really excited about that because our new Chief Information Officer is there, as well as a number of other incredible new executives from Salesforce, including our new Chief Accounting Officer and our Chief Commercial Officer. So really a cool thing to see Atlanta, in our kind of post-pandemic reality, become such a center of gravity for Salesforce. In fact, we just had our Q1 operations review there, and it was exciting to welcome Mike to the team.\nSo with that, let me just tell you it's been a whirlwind for our management team, as you're about to hear on this call. We have been on the road. I personally was just in Sydney, Australia. I was in Tokyo. We were in Atlanta, we were in New York. And last week, we were in Davos, Switzerland. All that was in, I think, the last 4 or 5 weeks. And we've really been all over the world. It's been pretty awesome. We've met with hundreds and hundreds of customers. And I can tell you that our business -- you can see this in the Q1 numbers, can't you, is incredibly healthy. And we also -- you can see we had a great quarter.\nWe're carefully watching the economic data. I know all of you are doing that as well. And so far, we're just not seeing any material impact from the broader economic world that all of you are in. Our demand environment where demand is very strong, and if you look over the last 23 years, Salesforce has proven to be incredibly resilient based on this incredible business model. We have an incredible technology model that we have, where we've been through all kinds of dot-com crashes and recessions and financial crises and global pandemics. And all of you have watched us go through every possible storm, but we continue to weather these storms through the power and strength of our model.\nIn 2001, I think it really impacted us. We almost lost our business because we were on monthly contracts, we didn't have the right cash flow structure. Investors just wouldn't give us any money. And so we made a lot of changes then, and it's really strengthened our business and made us more durable over time. There's now no better measure of our durability of the business model, the momentum of the business, the strength of the technology model, than our remaining performance obligation, the future revenue that we have in our contract.\nIn Q1, we had $42 billion in RPO, up 20% year-over-year, pretty amazing. And in every crisis we've experienced over nearly 1/4 of a century, well, I'll just tell you, I think that Salesforce, and I'm sure you all agree, always emerges stronger than ever. We became more strategic and more relevant to our customers because we focus on their success and that continues today. And that's why we've been able to grow our revenue for 72 consecutive quarters through every cycle, a focus on customer success. And it's why Salesforce remains the #1 in CRM now for the 9th year in a row, growing in share in all CRM segments yet again according to the IDC Software Tracker.\nWhen it comes to our financial results, we had, as you can see, a very strong quarter. And you can also know that the dollar, well, I think the dollar might even had a stronger quarter than we did, which is kind of amazing. And I certainly saw that in my travels over the last month. And although these kind of fluctuations in foreign currency markets and an unexpected impact in the quarter, we still delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, up 24% year-over-year.\nForeign exchange movements have resulted in a revenue headwind of about $109 million year-over-year, something we could not have anticipated. Operating cash flow, though, in the quarter, well, here it is, $3.7 billion up 14% year-over-year, reflecting very strong performance across the core business and operating margin in the quarter, well that was 17.6%.\nTurning to our revenue guidance. Well, as I mentioned, and as presented foreign exchange volatility, it increased the year-over-year headwinds by an additional $300 million for a total of $600 million for the year since we first gave you guidance in our Investor Day. To give you an example, I was in Japan for the first time since the pandemic a couple of weeks ago, I mean it was 2 weeks ago. And I couldn't believe the decline in the value of the yen. It was a very good time to be a tourist in Japan.\nBut I called our team, I said, this is great to be a tourist in Japan, but it's going to have implications as we roll this revenue out from the Japanese market to our U.S. dollars. And in fact, our Japan revenue in the fourth quarter faced a 12% headwind year-over-year, just to this yen historic fall, something I've just never seen.\nSo as a result of these headwinds, we're lowering our fiscal '23 revenue guidance by $300 million to $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion or about 20% growth year-over-year. For operating margin, we're raising our fiscal '23 non-GAAP guidance by 40 basis points to 20.4%, an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year. As all of you know, we're quite committed to consistent margin and cash flow growth as part of this long-term plan and model that we have to drive both top and bottom line performance.\nAnd as I said, this demand environment for our Customer 360 platform, as you're about to hear from Bret and from Gavin and from Amy and from others as well, it remains incredibly healthy. Our customer relationships are amazingly strong, as evidenced by these hundreds of customers that we've met with just in the last couple of weeks. And I'll tell you, as you hear some of these incredible stories from the quarter, companies like State Farm and F1 and Goodyear and even the Department of Commerce, well, I'll tell you, these customers, they're very excited to be able to get not only incredible productivity from our product but also growth as well.\nSo let me say that this is a time when every company, every industry, every government is investing in digital transformation. No company is better positioned than we are to help companies transform for the digital future. That was something we fully experienced in Davos last week, and I could not be more grateful to our 77,000 ohana, millions of Trailblazers who are making a difference for our customers and the world. And now over to Bret.\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. As Marc said, we had a great quarter, and we see strong demand across our clouds, our industries and our regions despite the unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds, and our results really demonstrate the power of our strategy. Our products are more relevant than ever before, as companies invest in our Customer 360 platform to connect with their customers and to drive cost savings in this new digital economy.\nOur technology is deeply differentiated, with our Hyperforce infrastructure and Einstein Artificial Intelligence, enabling our customers to reach global scale with levels of trust that are unmatched in the industry. Einstein is now doing 164 billion predictions per day, which is just incredible. Our ecosystem is unparalleled. We have over 15 million Trailblazers, creating what IDC estimates will be $1.6 trillion in economic impact for our customers and for our partners.\nAnd our business model, as Marc said, is durable. It's diversified across industries, regions, lines of business, ensuring we're resilient in the face of any economic cycle. And finally, our leadership team continues to focus on disciplined execution, which is driving both top line performance and sustained operating margin cash flow expansion.\nAs Marc said, we've all been on the road, and we've been reconnecting with our customers, our Trailblazers and our partners. And the common theme from the customers I've met with, from Singapore to New York to the 30 CEOs I met one-on-one with at Davos last week, is the digital transformation trends that dramatically accelerated during the pandemic. They continue full steam ahead despite all the volatility in the global economy.\nOne great example is ADP, the leader in home alarm systems. ADP used our Service Cloud to execute over 200,000 virtual service visits in its first quarter. As a result, the company avoided sending out technicians and trucks in 80% of its service cases. They lowered their costs and they lowered their carbon footprint, all while achieving higher customer satisfaction. This is the promise of technology to drive productivity. And our Customer 360 platform is relevant whether you're trying to scale growth, increase productivity and profitability or meet your sustainability goals. And all 3 are increasingly relevant to our customers across the globe.\nWe had strong year-over-year growth across every region in the quarter, 21% in the Americas, 33% in EMEA and 24% in APAC. We saw strong momentum across every cloud in our Customer 360 platform as well. Sales Cloud continues to accelerate, surpassing $1.6 billion in the quarter, growing 18% year-over-year with great wins like DoorDash and Stellantis. Stellantis, which was formed last year from the merger between Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, decided to standardize the entire company on Salesforce. They replaced more than 2,500 apps with Customer 360. And with Sales Cloud, they now have a single source of truth for all their customer engagement to drive growth, while delivering best-in-class personalized service.\nOur Service Cloud grew at 17% year-over-year to $1.76 billion in revenue in the quarter. State Farm, a long-time Salesforce customer, was a great Service Cloud success story this quarter. They're now combining our Field Service platform with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Financial Services Cloud to enhance their entire end-to-end customer support experience, especially during catastrophic events. We also continue to see strong momentum with our Marketing Cloud with customers like Bose and Colgate Palmolive. Our Marketing Cloud has become even more relevant to CMOs as they navigate the significant changes in mobile operating systems and new privacy regulations around the globe.\nThis is the new cookie-less world, and it's made growing and measuring consumer engagement harder than ever before, and it's driving investment in our Customer Data Platform, which has become one of the fastest-growing products we've ever released. Bose is using our CDP to unify their customer information from hundreds of different sources to drive hyper-personalized marketing, multichannel campaign management and real-time engagement, all with compliance and trust built in natively.\nWe also saw Commerce Cloud wins at YETI, Lâ€™OCCITANE and Goodyear, continuing the digital commerce trend that accelerated so rapidly in the pandemic. Together, Marketing and Commerce stood 22% year-over-year in the quarter. Our data clouds, including MuleSoft and Tableau, grew 15% year-over-year in the quarter. Data is the fuel for every digital interaction, and MuleSoft and Tableau continue to be foundational for every multi-cloud Customer 360 deal. Tableau wins in the quarter included ADP, Bose and Lookers Motor Group, a top auto retailer in the U.K.\nMuleSoft was also part of some of our largest deals in the quarter, including NTT and continues to deepen our relationships with existing customers like Rocket Mortgage. As you know, we've been working through some issues on MuleSoft's go-to-market motion over the past couple of quarters. Amy will get into specifics, but I'm encouraged by the progress we're making, and we have a strong pipeline for the back half of the year.\nI'm also excited to say that Slack continues to exceed our revenue expectations, with wins of the self-driving car company, Cruise and the U.K. Ministry of Justice. This was the fourth consecutive quarter we see more than 40% growth in customers spending more than $100,000 with Slack annually. We also continue to see strong momentum across our 12 industry verticals, including financial services, health care, consumer goods and manufacturing. Our industry-specific clouds were part of 7 of our top 10 deals this quarter.\nI'm so grateful for our 15 million Trailblazers, all of our partners and our 77,000 employees for helping provide our customers with the innovation, agility and resilience they need to navigate these uncertain times. Our customer success drives our financial success, and this unrivaled community is why our customers choose Salesforce as their trusted digital adviser. Now over to Gavin to talk about some of the customer success stories from the quarter.\n\nGavin E. Patterson\n\nPresident & Chief Revenue Officer, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks, Bret, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. I want to start by talking about the strong demand environment we're in. As Bret and Marc said, even in this volatile environment, companies are continuing to invest in their digital transformations, and we're seeing that in our strong pipeline and momentum in the business. I've been on the road this quarter across the U.S., Europe, Asia and most recently in Davos. And in all my conversations, there is a real sense of urgency with our customers.\nIn this new or digital work-from-anywhere world, our customers need to create incredible customer experiences across every interaction to stay competitive. And at the same time, they need to realize productivity gains, efficiencies and resilience from their technology investments.\nThat's why they're turning to Salesforce as their trusted digital advisers and to the Customer 360 as their digital platform. We're seeing this play out in the growth of transformational deals, customers making longer-term, multi-cloud investments in Salesforce. These Customer 360 transformation deals with 5 or more clouds grew 21% year-over-year in the quarter. We again saw strong growth in every region. In the Americas, we grew relationships with Brightspeed, Blue Shield of California, SHA Hotels, Workday, Covered California and Ferguson, a $23 billion distributor of plumbing and heating products.\nLooking at Ferguson in a little more detail. Ferguson has been able to grow its sales during the heart of the supply chain challenges using Customer 360 to give them a single view of their supplier, associate and customer relationships. And in the quarter, Ferguson significantly expanded its relationship with our professional services organization.\nIn EMEA, we had significant wins with Lookers Motor Group, Esprit and one of the largest telecom and media companies in France. They're standardizing on Salesforce to not only speed their time to market and reduce IT costs but also to deliver an amazing digital first, front-end experience for their 45 million subscribers. As I mentioned, we had a great win in the U.K. with Lookers Motor Group. With the Customer 360, Lookers has a single unified platform, driving efficiency within their dealerships and contact centers and improving the overall car buying experience for their customers.\nTurning to APAC. We continue to deepen our relationships with amazing brands like Kotak Mahindra Bank, LG and NTT, which is also a great Tableau and MuleSoft win. In LatAm, we had a significant win with Serasa Experian. They chose Salesforce Marketing Cloud to improve engagement with their current and prospective customers and to increase marketing efficiency. Formula 1 is watched by 1.5 billion viewers. And today, they're using Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Sales Cloud to attract new fans, increase fan engagement and convert that fan engagement into brand value and revenue.\nSalesforce will help Formula 1 leverage customer insights across every channel, both physical and nonphysical and create an end-to-end fan experience, strategy powered by an integrated platform. And our professional services team will help to manage their technology and implementation.\nIn the quarter, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce selected Salesforce to support the administration of the $48 billion from broadband grants to state territories, tribal entities and other eligible applicants to create more low-cost broadband service options and to address digital equality and inclusion needs across U.S. communities.\nAnd to wrap it up, DoorDash has grown tremendously since the pandemic. They fulfilled more than 400 million orders in the last quarter alone and as a mobile-first business growing at an incredible rate, DoorDash turned to Salesforce to improve the customer experience and to respond to issues in real time for its hundreds of thousands of merchants, customers and dashes. They also selected Sales Cloud and MuleSoft to enable them to bring in new merchants on faster and more efficiently.\nThese are just a few examples from our strong quarter, and we're grateful for customers' continued partnership and trust. Amy, over to you to discuss the financial details of the quarter.\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident & CFO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Gavin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Marc and Bret said, we had strong financial results this quarter, and our pipeline remains robust. We are well positioned to serve our customers in this uncertain macroenvironment. Let's go through some of our results for Q1 of fiscal '23, beginning with top line commentary.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $7.41 billion. This is up 24% year-over-year or 26% in constant currency. A few key highlights from the quarter. The momentum in Sales Cloud continued in Q1, with revenue accelerating to 18% growth year-over-year, 20% in constant currency. Slack again outperformed our revenue expectations with $348 million in Q1 compared to our guide of $330 million. The number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually, grew 45% year-over-year. Our industry's products remain in high demand and are providing out-of-the-box solutions to customers with specific needs. We saw an industry's product included in 7 out of our top 10 deals this quarter. And from a geographic perspective, EMEA performance was strong with particular strength in both the U.K. and France.\nNow to provide an update on MuleSoft. Total revenue increased 9% year-over-year against a strong prior year comparison, driven by lower-than-expected new business as we work through the go-to-market organizational changes we discussed on the last call. As a reminder, on average, 50% of MuleSoft's total contract value is recognized in period, resulting in more quarterly volatility than our core products. And as Bret mentioned, MuleSoft's pipeline remains strong, and we still anticipate seeing the benefits from these changes in the back half of fiscal '23.\nTotal company revenue attrition remains at record lows and in Q1, again, between 7% to 7.5%. And as Marc mentioned, our remaining performance obligation, representing all future revenue under contract ended Q1 at approximately $42 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, was approximately $21.5 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. Slack represented approximately 5% -- or 5 points of that growth, in line with our guidance. This strong RPO performance at our scale reflects the relevance of our product portfolio and strategic relationships with our customers.\nTurning to operating margin for the quarter. For Q1, non-GAAP operating margin was 17.6%. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.98. Mark-to-market accounting as the company's strategic investments benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.01.\nMoving to cash flow. For Q1, operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. CapEx was $179 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year.\nNow before turning to our guidance, I'd like to call attention to the impact that foreign exchange is having on our financials. As a reminder, our primary currency exposures are to the euro, the Great British pound, the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, to the Australian dollar. Since we last provided our outlook for fiscal year '23, the dollar has continued to strengthen against all of these currencies. And as such, we are providing increased transparency this quarter into the impact of FX on our guidance.\nNow let's get to that guidance. For the full year, the change in currencies represents an incremental $300 million year-over-year headwind on top of the $300 million we provided last quarter, bringing the total year-over-year FX headwind to $600 million. As such, we are now guiding to fiscal '23 revenue of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion or approximately 20% growth year-over-year. Our guidance continues to assume a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack.\nWe expect Q2 revenue of $7.69 billion to $7.7 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue guidance includes a $200 million year-over-year headwind from FX and a $360 million contribution from Slack. For Q2, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. This includes a 3-point headwind from FX. And as a reminder, Q2 represents flat fifth quarter of contribution to CRPO and, therefore, the year-on-year growth rate is now normalized.\nWe expect Q2 GAAP loss per share of negative $0.03 to negative $0.02 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 to $1.02. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.74 to $4.76. And please recall that our OIE and EPS guidance both assume no further mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investment portfolio.\nTurning to operating margin, I am very pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance by 40 basis points to 20.4%. This includes 100 to 125 basis points of headwind from M&A. This guidance increase represents an expansion of 170 basis points year-over-year and 270 basis points over 2 years, all driven by continued focus on disciplined decision-making across the organization. And as a company, we are committed to continuing to improve profitability over the long term.\nWith respect to FX, because our regional revenue and expenses are generally in the same currencies, there tends to be a natural hedge in our operating margin. As such, although we've seen FX headwinds to revenue, we don't currently anticipate a material impact to our operating margin for the full fiscal year.\nMoving to cash flow, we remain well on our way to drive another year of record cash flow generation, and we are reiterating our fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance of approximately 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. In addition, our guidance continues to assume a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs. We continue to expect CapEx of approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, resulting in free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 27% for the fiscal year.\nTo close, while there is uncertainty in the macroenvironment, our customers are continuing to come to Salesforce to transform their businesses. The demand we are seeing from our customers is a testament to the strength of these strategic relationships and the relevance of our product portfolio. This gives us confidence in the durability of our business model, and we're excited to help our customers navigate in this changing economy.\nNow before we wrap up, I do want to thank, specifically, Evan for his incredible leadership with the IR team over the last 2 years, his partnership and friendship and wish him all the best in his new role. And let me say officially welcome to Mike Spencer, who I'm delighted to have joining us. And with that, Emma, let's open the line for questions.",

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Now I'd like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nEvan Goldstein\n\nSVP of Corporate Planning and Operations Finance & Strategy, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThank you, Bo. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results conference Call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor.\nWith me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Bret Taylor, Vice Chair and Co-CEO; Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer; and Gavin Patterson, Chief Revenue Officer.\nAs a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings and press release.\nSome of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, in particular, our expectations around the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, acquisition, results of operation and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\nA description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.\nWith that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nWell, thanks, Evan. This is probably one of those calls that the most difficult type of call that we can do. And the reason why it is the most difficult call that we can do is all of the grim things that are happening in the world. And of course, all of us are witnesses to tragedies that we cannot believe our eyes. And at the same time, we're here on the call to tell you that Salesforce had perhaps the best quarter it's ever had in its history, and we are trying to measure our response.\nAnd this is actually very personal for me. I'm sure many of you know that my great grandfather actually immigrated from Kiev from -- growing up, it was Kiev in our household. And -- but my great grandfather, [Isaac Benioff], came to the United States from Kiev. And my grandfather was born here in the United States and then came to San Francisco and met to have my grandmother who was the second generation San Franciscan. And that's why I'm here now. I'm a fourth generation San Franciscan. But looking back and looking at my family now and the Ukraine, my heart is really breaking for them. And the senseless pain, the suffering, the -- it's just unbelievably difficult to see what is going on in the world.\nAnd while we really don't have employees or do business in the Ukraine or Russia of any consequence, I would say that we do have employees and families like mine. And with (inaudible) there and deep connections to the region in this part of the world, and our heart is continuing to break. And we've provided ways that we provide humanitarian care.\nI just provided some response through World Central Kitchen, which I highly endorse, Jose Andres, and someone who I've worked with for many years. And as we find more ways to provide humanitarian care, we will. This is very important to us and who we are in our core values at Salesforce.\nSo as I said, this is a difficult moment for us because we are not blind to what's happening in the world, and yet we did have probably, I would say, the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. And I'm here on the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. We've got significant numbers of our employees back here in the office. I was just with them. And I was also just spent a tremendous amount of time in survey in the city and how things are coming back to life here kind of in our post-pandemic reality that we're now entering, and it's powerful.\nThis energy around here is amazing. We're really turning a corner and our battle with the virus. And I believe, in many ways, COVID is behind us. And certainly, I know that Omicron and BA2 are very serious viruses, but we are in a very different position in the world today, fighting these things than we were a couple of years ago. And I want to thank everyone who has done so much for getting us through the last 2 years.\nIt really became very clear to us -- a couple of weeks ago, we had our fiscal year kickoff in New York City. We had 5,000 employees attending in person at the Javits Center. It was amazing to be with 5,000 employees again. We had -- we have 75,000 employees now in the company. 35,000 of our 75,000 employees have started since the pandemic. So we've had quite a bit of growth here at Salesforce.\nAnd I would also say that when we asked -- we're in the room -- and how many of you have not attended a Salesforce kickoff, stand up and be welcomed, I would say 75% of the room stood up. And Bret and I are conducting this kickoff together as a team, and I think we are both in shock. And when (inaudible)\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nIt was (inaudible).\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nIt was, right?\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nBeing in person again after so long.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nBeing back at the Javits Center with 5,000 employees, doing a kickoff. And with tens and tens of thousands of employees online -- and I'll tell you that we were able to get together safely, thanks to our safety cloud. We're interconnected with a number of COVID tests that we're dynamically updating how we were doing and trying to keep the virus at bear. There are still some virus there, but not a lot. And we did our best to have a very safe program, and we've been doing this now. We've had 2 Dreamforces with this program with our safety cloud. We've had the kickoffs, we had all kinds of events and programs all over the world using this technology.\nAnd it's very powerful, Mayor de Blasio, and he was talking about how we had built the contact tracing system for New York, which we did, and the vaccine management system for New York, which we did, and many apps and talking about how we landed a 787 during the height of the pandemic in New York, which we did, and providing millions of pieces of PPE and so forth. But the emotional part for me, and I don't know, Bret, you were, but when he said everywhere where our employees were sitting was a FEMA field hospital just a short time ago. And we were sitting in a hospital and having a kickoff. And we realized, wow, we've somehow gotten through this. And was that a moment?\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nYes. You could feel the impact and just the poignancy of the moment as everyone looked down at their seats and tried to imagine [a cut] and really capture just as hard and as long as it's been how far we've come.\n\nMarc R. Benioff\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nI'll tell you, I added up how many CEOs I've been with -- in the last 90 days and has been about 46. And as I've talked to all these CEOs all over the world and traveled and so forth, it's been a powerful couple of years and difficult. And I mean I'm grateful for what all of our Ohana have done and all of our employees have done and also our customers and the first responders and scientists and everybody to get through this because it does feel like -- and I think as evidenced by what we just went through in New York, we're kind of coming to the end of this. And it's not that this isn't still raging. I just read some horrible articles about what's going on right now in Hong Kong with BA2, but we are kind of coming to another stage here, and I hope that we're about to get back to a more normal world. And we're doing that, unfortunately, a war in a pandemic. This is not an uncommon story and very sad to see what's going on here.\nSo with that, I have to tell you, though, that I'm speaking now to our investors and analysts directly. And I'm speaking directly about the performance of the company. We had a phenomenal quarter. We capped off, which was just a phenomenal fiscal year '22 with just incredible numbers. And we continue to see just tremendous, tremendous demand from customers across every industry, every geography and every product category.\nAnd I think that like many of the portfolio managers who are on the call and will ask questions later, we're managing a full portfolio. We see that with products and geographies and industries. And across the whole portfolio, I would say there's a remarkable strength. And every company that I speak to and these CEOs that I'm speaking to, they're all going through major digital transformations. And those customers, they all are all beginning and ending with the customer. And our job remains to help these companies grow and achieve this transformation. And that's why we've had such an incredible year, and I'm confident that, that will continue. And you can see that in kind of these incredible numbers, but also our very deep commitment to this kind of very disciplined, very profitable and very cash flow positive, as you can see, the $6 billion number and the $7-plus billion number scheduled for next year and going up in the years to come that.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenue rose to more than $7.3 billion, up 26% year-over-year. That's pretty awesome for a company of our size that we did a 26% growth quarter at $7.3 billion. I don't think there were too many $7.3 billion quarters at 26% growth in the world this year. And for the full fiscal '22, revenue was $26.5 billion, again, up 25% year-over-year. Again, a $26 billion company growing 30% -- 25%. And of course, that's why we're coming in on this $32.1 billion year. So we're continuing to be the fastest-growing top 5 enterprise software company in history.\nSalesforce is on track to becoming the world's #1 enterprise cloud, software applications company. This operating margin for the quarter was 15%; and for the full year, 18.7%. And we've just continued to deliver this disciplined approach to margin expansion. And you can see that in the forecast for the quarter now at over 20% operating margin with the $32.1 billion year.\nSo with our unique business model, we continue to grow revenue at scale, drive operating margin expansion, leading to strong cash generation. I mean you can see that in all 3 aspects of this quarter. And we closed fiscal year '22 with really incredible cash flow, reaching a milestone of $6 billion in the year, and that's really up 25% year-over-year. That's really amazing, and I would say, far exceeded our goals.\nI'll tell you that based on our strong fiscal year '22 results, we're excited to raise our fiscal year '23 revenue guidance to $32.1 billion, something I've been excited to talk about at the high end of the range, representing 21% growth year-over-year. Amy, I hope that, that is just the beginning of the (inaudible) for the year. And we are committed to delivering a fiscal year '23 operating margin of 20%. And customer success is just continuing to just drive this financial success. And our product innovation is providing customers with the resilience they need to navigate these, I would say, grim and uncertain times. And that's why Salesforce has been ranked by IDC as the #1 CRM for 8 years in a row. We have a tremendous focus here, being the #1 CRM.\nOur entire Customer 360 portfolio, that is the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud and the Marketing Cloud and the Commerce Cloud and Slack and Tableau and MuleSoft. And by the way, other great clouds, too, that aren't even listed when we talk about these things like our Financial Services Cloud or our Safety Cloud or Sustainability Cloud. Putting them all together for our customers, well, it becomes the single source of truth, virtually, the entire Fortune 500. And all of this customer success is being led by an incredible management team, which I think everyone on the call will agree and I certainly believe never has been stronger or more aligned.\nNow I want to talk about a couple of customers real quickly and then wrap this up. Ford -- well, you're going to hear more from Bret and Gavin. We're helping major companies like this around the world transform their business and I love this company. I think it's one of the great companies, very transformational, tremendous new CEO. Jim Farley has got a great vision for the world. You've seen that -- if you haven't been inside this Lightning 150 truck. It's going to be the electric vehicle for everyone. It's the e-transit van. It's amazing. And I have 2 of these MACH-Es, a yellow one and a white one. And if you haven't tried it, you should go to the Ford dealer because it's just worth it to test drive the car because it drives very different than other electric cars, and I've had probably every single one because I love these things.\nAnd a few weeks ago, I was with Jim Farley, and we launched the Ford Pro business unit. And it -- they're doing a B2B business unit at Ford to complement their B2C unit, not so unlike a lot of our other customers like Home Depot. But I'll tell you that Ford Pro, that -- they're really looking at targeting professionals, targeting productivity. They're really looking at giving the motivation for the professional. And I'll tell you, I live in a rural area, and I even have a Ford 550 truck, which is configured as a fire truck, is when things go wrong, I have to be ready for that. And they have telematics, but I am excited to be able to build all these Customer 360 services around this Ford 550 truck because I'm trying to turn that Ford 550 into a Ford 360. That's how I look at this world. And I'll tell you that Jim Farley right up (inaudible) not so far away from here a few weeks ago. And it was awesome to see their product line, but also how their customers and their partners are all really connecting with this -- these new products in incredible new ways.\nAnd when you look at Ford and kind of they're driven towards, well, sustainability, it I -- find it to be very much aligned with what's happening in the world because we all know we're in a climate emergency. We need everyone to get to net zero as fast as possible.\nSalesforce now coming into the Fortune 100 this year. We are a net zero company already, fully renewable across our entire value chain. We've achieved 100% renewable energy for our global operations. We're reducing emissions further. We're very sensitive to what we're doing with all of our products with sustainability, and we know we can't stop. There's no finish line on sustainability. It's really one of our very core values now. And we're operationalizing sustainability in every part of our business. It's an area I spend a lot of time on in the last, I would say, 6 months, even looking at new investments. Bret and I just looked at a very cool company together. When you say we were surprised the type of companies that we're looking in carbon relationship management that before we were not, it's the new CRM, carbon relationship management, because there's a lot we can do in analytics, in information management, and in helping our customers get the carbon that they need to be successful. And every business can be a platform for addressing climate change.\nThe first step is for each and one of us to commit to being net zero ourselves. I have a lot of friends who are venture capitalists are saying they're going to move into the sustainability world. And I said to them, the first thing they need to do in their portfolios, get their portfolios to be net zero. All of our work around sustainability might be the most important rewarding work of our lives. Well, it's one of the things we celebrate. Salesforce is going to be 23 years old, amazing, on March 8, just a few days from now, a quarter versus century. It's getting there. Just Parker is not with us today. He's traveling. So I want to just say happy birthday to Parker and thank you for starting this great company with me so many years ago, and we look at all the evolutions of the company and the management team and the products and its -- the employees and all of our Ohana and all of our stakeholders, thank you. When we started this in 1999, I never dreamed we would have become this amazing company and entering the Fortune 100 in 2022. So this is awesome.\nAnd our values have created so much value when we look at $0.5 billion in grants now to our communities, $6.7 million in employee volunteer hours, more than $100 million here to our San Francisco and Oakland public schools who so badly need it, especially right now, running 55,000 nonprofits and NGOs on our product for free and so many other things that we've been able to do here, the children's hospitals here in San Francisco or so many other things around the world. So thank you to all of you for making that happen. And we're also delighted -- and thank you to our trailblazers, especially who believes so much in our products. They've lifted us up. And again, Parker and I are just so very grateful. And now over to you, Bret.\n\nBret Steven Taylor\n\nVice Chair & Co-CEO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThank you, Marc. I really appreciate it. As Marc said, we had a phenomenal quarter to finish another phenomenal year of innovation and customer success. And you can see it in our performance. Our operating model and our discipline are generating profitable growth at incredible scale.\nI've had the privilege of meeting hundreds of customers over the past few months. And the thing I've come away with after those conversations is that Salesforce is more strategic to their success than ever before.\nEvery company is going through a digital transformation. And that transformation starts and ends with their customers. That's what drove our incredible performance in every region this quarter, 23% in the Americas, 38% in EMEA and 20% in APAC. We continue to see tremendous demand from our customers across the entire Customer 360 portfolio. Companies like KPMG and Scotiabank are using Sales Cloud to build digitally native sales teams with brand-new products like revenue intelligence and our new Slack integrations. Sales Cloud growth accelerated again this quarter to 17% year-over-year, and it's now a $6 billion revenue business.\nCompanies like State Farm and U.S. Bank expanded their use of sales -- Service Cloud this quarter, helping it grow at 18% year-over-year to nearly $6.5 billion in revenue. These sales and service businesses are just incredible. Independently, each is larger than any other cloud Software-as-a-Service company, and they're more relevant to more customers than they've ever been in our 23-year history.\nOur Marketing Cloud also continued to show strong growth with customers like Humana and Sunrun. Marketing Cloud delivered over 40 billion messages in Cyber Week alone and delivered 4.1 billion messages per day throughout Q4, up 37% year-over-year. Just these takeaway, which Gavin and I recently visited in Amsterdam is a great Marketing Cloud success story from the quarter. (inaudible) leading online food delivery marketplace. And like all digitally native companies, they've adopted Slack as their digital headquarters with 11,000 monthly active users. This quarter, they expanded with Marketing Cloud to engage with their customers, their restaurant partners and their delivery carriers.\nWe also saw Commerce Cloud wins at Ralph Lauren, Bos, Sonos, continuing this trend towards digital commerce that accelerated so rapidly in the pandemic. Together, Marketing and Commerce grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter.\nBoth Tableau and MuleSoft continue to be the data foundation for our multi-cloud Customer 360 deployments. Tableau had strong wins in the quarter with Southwest Airlines, IBM and Sunrun. MuleSoft was also a part of some of our largest deals in the quarter, including Bos, Deloitte and Ford. Together, our Tableau and MuleSoft data business accelerated to 23.5% year-over-year growth in the quarter.\nAnd I'm happy to say that Slack continues to exceed our expectations in every way as every company in the world build the digital headquarters for this next generation of work that Marc was just talking about. With key wins at companies like Carvana and Netflix, the number of customers spending $100,000 annually with Slack increased by 46% year-over-year. Marc and I could not be more pleased with how the Slack integration is going, and that remains our top priority as a management team. That's why, as we said at our Investor Day, we don't have any plans for material M&A in the near term. Slack is our focus.\nIt's been so great to hear Slack come up in almost every one of those hundreds of customer conversations I had this quarter. PayPal is a great example from the quarter. We've had a long relationship with Dan Schulman and the PayPal team who use Customer 360 across both their B2B and their B2C businesses. This quarter, PayPal expanded their use of Slack, using new capabilities like Slack Huddles where thousands of real-time audio calls every week, and Slack Chat bots to respond to employee questions, log IT tickets and more.\nThis digital transformation acceleration is happening in every industry, and you can see it in the momentum of our industry clouds. These are our purpose-built solutions for financial services, health care, consumer goods, energy and 8 other industries.\nWe saw unprecedented growth across our industry solutions, and our most strategic multi-cloud deals were driven by our industry-specific products. GEICO is a great example. GEICO is the second largest auto insurer in the U.S. with over 25,000 agents, led by an incredible CEO in Todd Combs. Our professional services team is working with GEICO to deliver a digital-first customer experience with our Financial Services Cloud. And it's improving their customer experience and saving the company millions in costs at the same time.\nWe saw strong growth in all segments, including meaningful acceleration in our largest transformational deals as well as our lower end transactional deals and Slack self-service business. These transactional businesses are the closest thing we have to a real-time economic barometer. And right now, all the indicators are positive. And perhaps most importantly, this quarter, we saw the lowest customer attrition in our company's history despite all the disruption in the economy. Overall, it was an extraordinary quarter, and we're seeing incredible momentum in the business.\nAs Marc said, as a leadership team, we've never been more aligned, and we're executing better than we've ever had. I'm enormously proud of our entire team. I'm grateful to the support of our customers, our partners and all of our stakeholders as we continue to deliver incredible growth at scale quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And over to you, Gavin.\n\nGavin E. Patterson\n\nPresident & Chief Revenue Officer, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThanks, Bret. I would echo Marc and Bret on just how many remarkable customer success stories we saw in the quarter across all our full portfolio of products, industries and geographies. The dynamics we're seeing in customer engagement are absolutely fantastic.\nJust over the past few months, I've done more than 75 meetings with C-Suite executives, and the accessibility, that sense of urgency and interest from the highest levels of companies is incredible and shows no signs of slowing down. What's clear is there is a tremendous appetite for digital transformation, and we fully expect that to continue.\nIn the Americas, we grew relationships with Accenture, Banco C6, Scotiabank State Farm, the state of Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Bank Zoom and so many more. In EMEA, we continue to deepen our relationships with Airbus, Cloud Factory and AlphaSights. And in APAC, we had significant wins with incredible organizations like [Bank of Philippines], Panasonic Corporation and Hitachi. Health care also stood out with wins like Humana, IQVIA, (inaudible) Health and Teladoc Health. Moderna is another one in that category. Their intent on becoming the first fully digital biotech company, embedding analytics, AI and automation across every step of their value chain. We are a key partner on that journey. With Health Cloud, Moderna will gain a more complete view of its customers. And with Einstein and Tableau CRM, they will be able to analyze data across all departments and use predictive analytics to make better decisions.\nAnd we continue to build our relationship with Sanofi where the CEO, Paul Hudson, and his team are already using Health Cloud and Service Cloud. In Q4, they added Consumer Goods Cloud (inaudible) CRM and Salesforce B2B Commerce, which will let them better engage with health care providers, patients and pharmacies around the world. This is another great example of our complete Customer 360 portfolio at work.\nWe also grew our partnership with Mercedes-Benz in the quarter. They're using Salesforce to transform the way they engage with their customers. And as Mercedes becomes even more sustainable and reimagine their fleet for the electric future, they're relying on Customer 360 to unite their sales, service and marketing teams around a single shared view of each customer.\nRalph Lauren is another great expansion. And I'm not just saying that because the CEO of Patrice Louvet, which my former boss at P&G. We're helping Ralph Lauren deepen its connection with its customers in both digital and physical setting, particularly as they expand into new regions. In fact, Commerce Cloud helping grow their North American online sales by over 30% in the December quarter. And throughout the pandemic, Ralph Lauren has relied on Slack to keep their geographically distributed teams working together seamlessly from anywhere.\n18 months ago, Australia's state of Victoria Department of Health selected Salesforce to deploy a COVID-19 contact tracing system. In Q4, Victoria tapped Salesforce to provide a technology foundation for managing the state's COVID response efforts. For example, Victoria is using MuleSoft to integrate information from various systems, detecting COVID cases as the virus moves between outbreaks and steady-state living and has also deployed Marketing Cloud to enhance communications with citizens affected by the pandemic. These are just some of the highlights from an amazing quarter of customer success from anywhere. We are proud to have supported these and so many other companies and are grateful to all our customers for their continued trust.\nAnd as Marc and Bret said, our customers' success drives our financial success. I'm really grateful to be part of this management team, which I think has never been stronger or more aligned or even more committed to generating disciplined profitable growth at scale. Also, I want to thank our team for their outstanding execution. We're continuing to do such a great job in the midst of a massive global change.\nAmy, over to you to share the financial details of our quarter.\n\nAmy E. Weaver\n\nPresident & CFO, salesforce.com, inc.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and hello to everyone on the line. Fiscal '22 was a remarkable year for Salesforce. Our focus on disciplined and profitable growth drove record levels of revenue, margin and cash flow.\nSo let me take you through some of the results for Q4 and full year fiscal '22, beginning with the top line commentary. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.33 billion, which includes $312 million from Slack. This is up 26% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency. We continue to execute upon the robust demand environment that we highlighted throughout fiscal '22.\nFor the full year, total revenue was $26.5 billion, which is up 25% year-over-year or 24% in constant currency. Full year revenue includes $592 million from the 2 quarters of Slack. Our portfolio of relevant products, serving a broad set of customers and customer needs continues to drive our business performance.\nA few key highlights from the quarter. As you've heard from Marc and Bret and Gavin, our core business continues to perform very, very well. Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are both $6 billion businesses. And in Q4, they grew 17% and 18% year-over-year, respectively.\nOur progress in the enterprise continues with our largest deals getting even larger. The number of 7-figure deals signed in Q4 grew 34% year-over-year. And in Q4, the number of 8-figure deals more than doubled.\nOur industry products also continued to perform very well. In fact, our largest deal ever, as measured by incremental ARR, was a financial services win that we signed during the quarter, and 8 of our top 10 deals included an industries product.\nI also want to provide an update on MuleSoft, which grew 24% year-over-year during Q4. We continue to realize the benefits of the go-to-market organizational changes we implemented last year. We're happy with the progress. However, we do not anticipate seeing the full benefit of these changes until the back half of fiscal '23.\nLast quarter, during Q3, we drove attrition -- our attrition rate to below 8% for the first time in company history. Now for the second quarter in a row, our attrition is again at an all-time low. Ending Q4 revenue attrition was between 7% to 7.5%.\nOur remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q4 at approximately $43.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, which represents all future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, was approximately $22 billion, up 22% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. The outperformance was driven by new business outperformance and strong (inaudible)\nSlack represents approximately 4.5 points of CRPO growth, slightly ahead of the 4 points provided during last quarter's guidance.\nTurning to operating margin. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 18.7%, which represents approximately 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes 140 basis points of headwind from M&A. I'm very proud that our team drove strong margin expansion while also absorbing our largest acquisition ever.\nQ4 GAAP EPS was negative $0.03, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84. Realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.03. For the full fiscal year, GAAP EPS was $1.48 and non-GAAP EPS was $4.78. Realized and unrealized gains on our strategic investment portfolio benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.93 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.98.\nTurning to cash flow. I was particularly pleased with how we closed the year, completing a milestone year of cash generation. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow was $6 billion, up 25% year-over-year. CapEx was $717 million, resulting in free cash flow of $5.3 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Recent M&A represented a 2-point headwind to both our operating and free cash flows. Excluding the impact of M&A, our full year operating cash flow growth rate was 27%, and our free cash flow growth rate was 31%.\nNow on to guidance. We are raising our Q1 revenue guidance by $130 million to $7.37 billion to $7.38 billion or approximately 24% growth year-over-year, and that is coming off a historically strong Q1 last year. This guidance assumes a $330 million contribution from Slack. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '23 revenue guidance by $300 million to $32 billion to $32.1 billion or approximately 21% growth year-over-year. Our guidance assumes a $1.5 billion contribution from Slack.\nIn addition, last week, we announced our acquisition of Traction on Demand, a professional services business. Our revenue guidance assumes a $75 million contribution in [fiscal '23] from Traction on Demand, which we anticipate will close by the end of this fiscal quarter. Please note that the deals remain subject to customary closing conditions.\nForeign currency has continued to be highly, highly volatile. To give you a sense of the impact on our business, our fiscal '23 revenue guidance reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million from FX.\nFor Q1, we expect to deliver CRPO growth of approximately 21%. This includes roughly 5 points of growth from Slack. We expect Q1 GAAP EPS of negative $0.05 to negative $0.04 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.93 to $0.94. For the full year, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.62 to $4.64.\nAs a reminder, please keep in mind that our other income and expense, or OEI, guidance incorporates the impact from debt raised for Slack. Please also recall that our OIE and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark-to-market accounting.\nWe are also reiterating our fiscal '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 20%, representing an expansion of 130 basis points year-over-year. We expect 100 to 125 basis points of headwind from M&A. This disciplined approach will drive another year of strong cash flow generation.\nWe are initiating fiscal '23 operating cash flow guidance of approximately 21% to 22% year-over-year. We do not expect an OCF headwind from Slack for the full year.\nIn addition, our guidance currently assumes a 3-point headwind from cash taxes associated with tax law changes requiring the capitalization of certain R&D costs.\nAs we continue to scale our operations, I am particularly pleased with our CapEx guide for this year. We expect CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal '23, which is an all-time low for the business. This results in anticipated free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 26% for the fiscal year.\nTo close, we believe that our portfolio of differentiated and relevant technology is well positioned in a large and rapidly growing market. Fiscal '22 was an extraordinary year for the company as we drove record levels of revenue and operating margin and cash flow. This demonstrates that with discipline, we can achieve profitable growth at scale.\nI am very thankful for the opportunity over my first year to meet so many members of our shareholder community, both in person and virtually, and I look forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years.\nNow Evan, shall we open up the call for questions? And Bo, you can go ahead and open up the line. Thank you.",

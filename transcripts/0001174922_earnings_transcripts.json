[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Jenny Holaday, Linda Chen and Frederic Luvisutto.\nPlease note that we've published a presentation to provide more color on the company and recent performance ahead of this call. You can find the presentation on our Investor Relations website. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon. And as always, thank you for joining us. I'll jump right into the quarter, and I'll kick off here in base. Wynn Las Vegas continued to see notable gaming market share gains in the quarter, driven by our incredible team and market-leading product and service, resulting in EBITDA growth on a hold-adjusted basis of 3% to $211 million against a difficult comp.\nDemand in the casino was healthy throughout the quarter with solid increases in both drop and handle, leading to casino revenues that were up 10%. Hotel revenue was flat at $187 million, demonstrating that our plan to accept slightly lower occupancy in order to preserve ADR and maximize EBITDA paid off during the quarter. In fact, in August, the property set an all-time monthly EBITDA record.\nWe also look forward to completing the renovation of the Fairway Villas by the end of this quarter and to the opening of [indiscernible] Apologies. Sorry for that. Wynn Las Vegas continued to see notable gaming market share gains in the quarter, driven by our incredible team and market-leading products and service, as I mentioned. More recently, business in the fourth quarter has seen continued momentum with drop and handle both up versus the same prior period last year. We've also seen notable growth in REVPAR and strong retail sales.\nSo with the fourth quarter off to a strong start, we are now turning our attention to F1. You can look at our published room rates for the event and see that we are once again pricing at a significant premium to the market.\nLooking further out, our group and convention business looks strong heading into 2026 on pace to grow both room nights and rate over 2025. I do want to note that as we begin the Encore Tower remodel in the spring, we will lose about 80,000 room nights in 2026. We will attempt to pick up some of that in rate, but the remodel will present a slight headwind for 2026. Importantly, we continue to invest in our market-leading assets here in Las Vegas. And ultimately, while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty remain a consideration, we remain positive on the outlook for our business in Las Vegas.\nTurning to Boston. We generated $58 million in EBITDAR. In terms of fundamentals, the business at Encore Boston Harbor remains solid with slot revenues growing over 5% year-on-year and OpEx tightly controlled. More recently, demand in Boston has remained healthy in October with both drop and handle above last year.\nMacau also delivered very strong results in the quarter, which were further aided by higher-than-normal VIP hold. The business generated $308 million in EBITDAR, including $23 million of VIP hold benefits. Mass volumes were particularly strong, up 15% year-on-year despite the weather disruption near the end of the quarter. The cadence of Golden Week was a bit unusual this year and that we saw heavier volumes towards the tail end of the holiday and after the holiday period. Beyond Golden Week, volume metrics in the quarter have been strong with turnover and mass drop both running well ahead of last year. With sustained double-digit market-wide growth in GGR, we continue to be optimistic about the future of Macau.\nThe premium segment continues to lead the market in Macau. Last quarter, we discussed 2 new projects and expansion of The Chairman's Club gaming area at Wynn Palace and a refresh of our Wynn tower rooms at Wynn Macau to ensure we continue to take advantage of this ongoing demand. Both projects are moving along very quickly. The Chairman's Club expansion should be complete ahead of Chinese New Year, and we are already completing the initial floors of the Wynn tower room renovation now. While we expect some minor disruption into year-end from these projects, once complete, they will further elevate our offerings at both properties.\nWynn Al Marjan Island continues to progress rapidly, and we look forward to welcoming many of you to the site in less than a month. We're pouring the final 2 floors now and are on track to top out the tower ahead of our analyst event in December. We are also pleased to announce our first development on the Marjan Land Bay adjacent to Wynn Marjan, the Al Marjan Island by [ Oman ] Group. Oman team are world class, and we're delighted to have them as a neighbor.\nFrom a structuring perspective, our JV, the same JV that owns enlarge on, will own the property and the Oman team will manage the asset. Given the recent success of condo sales in the UAE in general and, in particular, we anticipate our portion of the equity check for the project will be quite small, about $25 million to $50 million. Beyond the stand-alone merits of the transaction, we also expect Janus high-quality customers will be additive to Wynn Al Marjan Island.\nWith the Marjan Land Bank, we have significant additional long-term development opportunities in the UAE. You can see more about this initial development in our quarterly earnings presentation. We remain on track for our targeted opening date of Wynn Al Marjan Island and look forward to showcasing what we believe is the most compelling development opportunity in the industry.\nWith no competing operations announced to date, when Wynn Al Marjan Island will be the only integrated resort in what many analysts are predicting will be a $5 billion-plus GGR market. Our future continues to be bright. The opening of Wynn Al Marjan Island and the free cash flow inflection that it will bring gives us confidence that our best days lie ahead.\nI'll now hand it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $203.4 million in adjusted property EBITDAR of $621 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 32.8%. Unfavorable hold negatively impacted EBITDA in the quarter by just under $8 million. OpEx excluding gaming tax per day was $4.3 million in the quarter, up 3.1% compared to the prior year due to a bad debt swing and onetime expenses in repairs and maintenance Otherwise, there were normal cause ebbs and flows in OpEx.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $58.4 million on revenue of $211.8 million with an EBITDA margin of 27.6%. Slot revenues were very strong, up 5% and set a new record for Boston. We maintained our discipline on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1.16 million up 1.9% compared to Q3 2024 despite continued labor cost pressures in that market. The Boston team has continued to do a great job of mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $308.3 million in the quarter on $1 billion of operating revenue resulting in an EBITDA margin of 30.8%. Higher than normal VIP hold impacted EBITDA by a little under $23 million in the quarter. OpEx excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.75 million per day in Q3, up 7.6% year-on-year with the increase driven primarily by the Gourmet Pavilion and normal cost of living expenses as we called out last quarter. This quarter, we also saw the variable impact of higher business volumes and about $2.5 million of typhoon-related OpEx.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, last quarter, we initiated 2 projects, as Craig mentioned, and expansion of The Chairman's Club gaming area at Wynn Palace and a refresh of our Wynn tower rooms at Wynn Macau. And together with other ongoing CapEx projects, we continue to expect to spend $200 million to $250 million in total for 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of $4.6 billion as of September 30. This was comprised of $2.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. The combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating just under $2.3 billion of LTM adjusted property EBITDA, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4.3x. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile also allow us to continue returning capital to shareholders in both Macau and the U.S.\nTo that end, Wynn Macau paid out approximately $125 million in dividends in Q3 after paying a similar amount in Q2. In addition, the Wynn Resorts Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on November 26, 2025, to stockholders of record as of November 17. Our recurring dividend highlights our focus on and continued commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nIn terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $164 million in the quarter, primarily related to the Fairway Villas renovations and food and beverage enhancements in Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. In addition to that figure, we contributed $93.9 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $835 million. We also continued to draw on the Marjan construction loan with a drawn amount to date of $583.7 million. We estimate our remaining share of the required equity, including the new project is approximately $525 million to $625 million.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

We estimate our remaining 40% pro rata share of the required equity is approximately $600 million to $675 million.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for approximately $158 million. These share buybacks, together with our recurring dividend, highlight our focus on and continued commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. In terms of CapEx, we spent approximately $165 million in the quarter, primarily related to the Fairway Villas renovations and F&B enhancements in Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. In addition to that figure, we contributed $58.2 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $741.1 million.\nThe combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating just over $2.2 billion of LTM adjusted property EBITDAR, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just under 4.4x. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile also allows us to continue returning capital to shareholders in both Macau and the U.S. To that end, Wynn Macau recently increased its final dividend for 2024 to approximately $125 million, which was paid in the second quarter. In addition, the Wynn Resorts Board has approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 29, 2025, to stockholders of record as of August 18.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of $3.6 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and a little over $1.7 billion in the U.S. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced an upsize of our credit facility in Macau, where we added $1 billion of additional undrawn revolver capacity from a number of new lenders, providing significant additional liquidity and flexibility to our balance sheet and indicating the strong confidence and support of our lenders in the market.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, as Craig mentioned, we've initiated 2 projects, an expansion of the Chairman's Club gaming area at Wynn Palace and a refresh of our Wynn Tower rooms at Wynn Macau. And together with our other ongoing CapEx projects, we expect to spend a total of $200 million to $250 million in total for 2025.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $253.7 million in the quarter on $883.5 million of operating revenue, resulting in an EBITDAR margin of 28.7%. Lower-than-normal VIP hold impacted EBITDAR by a little under $13 million in the quarter. OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.66 million per day in Q2, up 4.5% year-on-year, with the increase driven primarily by the Gourmet Pavilion and normal course cost of living increases. The team has done a great job in staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to grow over time.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $63.9 million on revenue of $215.7 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29.6%. Casino revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, and we maintained our discipline on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1.15 million, flat to Q2 2024 despite continued labor cost pressures in that market. The Boston team has continued to do a great job of mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $234.8 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $638.6 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDAR margin of 36.8%. Low hold negatively impacted EBITDAR in the quarter by $11.4 million. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, was $4.2 million in the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year due to normal wage inflation from our union and nonunion areas. As Craig mentioned earlier, we're pleased to be resuming our Encore Tower Remodel with construction set to begin in spring 2026 with an estimated spend of $330 million, which we expect to take about a year to complete.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nI'll now hand it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\nAs I have said before, our future is bright. And to that end, we purchased $158 million of stock in the second quarter at a weighted average price of just under $79 per share.\nWynn Al Marjan Island continues to progress rapidly. We are pouring the 61st floor and on track to top out the tower later this year. We've also finalized several important food and beverage partnerships and agreed to key terms with a number of high-profile retail tenants. We remain on track for our targeted opening date of Wynn Al Marjan Island and continue to believe it is the most compelling development opportunity in the industry. Wynn Al Marjan will be the only property operating in what many analysts are predicting will be a $5-plus billion gaming revenue market.\nFor June and July combined, we generated normalized EBITDAR of $3.3 million per day, which we've normalized to account for high hold during that period. The premium segment continues to lead the market forward in Macau. To further enhance our premium positioning, we have recently initiated 2 key capital projects, an expansion of the Chairman's Club gaming area at Wynn Palace and a refresh of our Wynn Tower rooms at Wynn Macau. While we expect some minor disruption toward the end of the year from these projects, once they are complete, we expect they will further elevate our offerings at both properties.\nMacau delivered solid results in the quarter, though we were impacted by lower-than-normal VIP holds. During the quarter, we saw a steady April and strong June, offset slightly by a more subdued May. The business generated $266 million in VIP normalized EBITDAR with unfavorable VIP hold costing us nearly $13 million. Volumes were up nicely in the quarter with mass drop up 3.6% year-on-year and VIP volumes up meaningfully versus Q2 2024, though mass hold was a bit lower than we would like, particularly in May. Volumes accelerated further in July, which was a standout month despite some weather disruption with drop up year-on-year and sequentially versus June.\nOn last quarter's call, we talked specifically about the uncertainty in the tariffs that introduced into some of our development plans, primarily in Las Vegas. Subsequent to that call, we revised our sourcing and procurement plan for the Encore Tower Remodel in Vegas. And I now expect we will kick off that renovation in spring 2026 with minor disruptions during the renovation period. Encore Boston Harbor generated $64 million of EBITDAR, up about 3% year-on-year. Casino revenues grew over 5% year-over-year, driven by strength in both tables and slots. More recently, demand in Boston remained healthy in July with total casino revenues roughly flat to last year.\nLooking ahead, while macroeconomic uncertainty, including tariffs, remains a consideration, we remain positive about the business in Las Vegas. We saw the forward booking pace accelerate as July progressed, and our group and convention business looks strong heading into the fourth quarter and 2026. 2026 is shaping up to be a record year for both group room nights and revenues.\nWe were also pleased to grow REVPAR a little over 1%, and we saw continued strength in retail. More recently, the business in July saw continued momentum in the casino with drop and handle both up versus July 2024, and strong retail sales. In the hotel in July, we had very strong weekends with softer midweek. In response, we prioritized midweek rate over occupancy, consistent with our premium positioning and made operational adjustments tied to occupancy levels.\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, and as always, thank you for joining us. I'm incredibly proud of our second quarter results. Wynn Las Vegas continued to be an outstanding performer on the strip, and we were pleased that EBITDAR in Las Vegas grew to a new second quarter record, up 2% year-over-year to nearly $235 million. Adjusting for hold, that number would have been even higher at $246 million. Demand was healthy throughout the quarter with impressive increases in both drop and handle driving a 14.5% increase in total casino revenues, a reflection of our ability to continue to take gaming market share.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\nPlease note that we published a presentation to provide more color on the company and recent performance ahead of this call. You can find the presentation on our Investor Relations website. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Jenny Holliday, Linda Chen and Frederic Luvisutto.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nThis call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\n[Operator Instructions]\nWelcome to the Wynn Resorts Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen and Frederic Luvisutto. Please note that we published a presentation to provide more color on the company and recent performance ahead of this call, you can find the presentation on our Investor Relations website. This will become a regular fixture along with our earnings release going forward.\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings. .\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie, and good afternoon. As always, thank you for joining us today. We've been very active over the past 3 years, making innumerable positive changes to and investments in our businesses in Las Vegas, Boston and Macau. Changes in how we market in our underlying technology and how we deliver service to our best customers, in how we build and program food and beverage and retail, and how we program entertainment in the production of our own unique events and in how we control expenses.\nAll of these changes made in pursuit of further differentiating ourselves from our competitors. And you can see the results of these efforts in our 2024 results, yet another record year of adjusted property EBITDAR including another annual record in Las Vegas. Operationally, we are stronger, more nimble and more results focused than we have ever been. Meanwhile, we are expeditiously developing what I believe to be the most exciting development project in the industry in the UAE, a project that will ultimately produce meaningful EBITDA and further diversify our business. The opening of that project, coupled with a concurrent reduction in the amount of CapEx we will be deploying in North America will also mark an important inflection point in our free cash flow profile.\nOur future is bright. And it is this bright future, coupled with the fact that our stock price continues to inappropriately reflect the value of our assets that drove us to purchase $200 million of stock in the fourth quarter and another $150 million thus far in Q1. While industry multiples remain suppressed, while growth capital remains focused on a narrow set of AI and tech companies and until we believe when Al Marjan is appropriately reflected in our valuation, we will continue to repurchase our equity because we believe the return profile on those repurchases is meaningful.\nNow turning to the quarter and starting here in Las Vegas. Demand remained healthy in the fourth quarter with table games drop essentially flat against a very tough comp and slot handle up by 13%. Our gaming market share for the quarter grew meaningfully, highlighting the strength and quality of what we offer here in Vegas.\nOur non-gaming business in Q4 was also strong, though it was impacted by tough year-over-year comparisons during F1 week. EBITDA during the event in 2024 was about $20 million lower than in 2023. The lion's share of the difference was due to a decline in RevPAR stemming from lower overall Las Vegas room rates during that event, though it is important to note that in both years, our ADRs were about 50% higher than the 2 closest competing properties here in Las Vegas. And our daily EBITDA during the 2024 event remains materially elevated relative to the years before F1 was a fixture in the market.\nThe F1 team did a tremendous job with this year's event. And with the event having now settled in, we have a good baseline from which to grow in future years. More recently, demand in January looked good, with both drop and handle up year-over-year and ADR and F&B covers both up year-over-year. Of course, this year, we didn't have the benefit of hosting the Super Bowl here in Las Vegas, which impacts February, and that's about a $25 million EBITDA headwind for Q1 versus 2024. Excluding Super Bowl weekend, all of our key volume metrics are up year-over-year.\nLooking further out, we already have our budgeted group and convention room nights for 2025 on the books at healthy ADRs and transient booking demand over the last 2 weeks has been extremely robust. When coupled with a calendar that is once again chock-full of large demand drivers in the market, the setup for 2025 feels good. The team at Wynn Las Vegas continues to set the standard and with new food and beverage openings later this year, including the much anticipated opening of 0 bond, a planned renovation of the Encore tower and other relatively modest targeted investments, we will exit 2025 even stronger and with limited remaining CapEx on the horizon.\nTurning to Boston. Encore Boston Harbor generated just shy of $59 million of EBITDA. We were encouraged by particular strength in our slot business where handle was up 6%, this helps set a new all-time property record for slot revenue, offsetting some of the union-related payroll increases incurred in 2024. We continue to grow the database and stabilize some of the recently opened food and beverage outlets with the property's best days ahead.\nMore recently, demand in Boston has remained healthy through January, led by strong year-over-year growth in slot handle and stable nongaming revenue against a tough comp. Turning to Macau. We generated $293 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, down about 1% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. While the market in Macau continues to be competitive, we remain disciplined in our focus on maximizing EBITDA and maintaining a healthy margin profile.\nWe recently completed the rollout of digital tables throughout Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, which will yield OpEx benefits and when coupled with our data science and machine learning capabilities should allow us to be more precise and more efficient with reinvestment over the medium term.\nOn the CapEx side, we made a number of improvements and optimizations in Macau in the fourth quarter most notably an expansion of the Chairman's Club at Wynn Macau, a gaming area focused on our best customers. We will also soon be adding a variety of food and beverage offerings at Wynn Palace with the opening of our destination food hall a development that we believe will drive incremental visitation and footfall to Wynn Palace.\nWe also continue to advance design work and approvals on the remainder of our concession-related CapEx, the event center, the theater and a production show at Palace. More recently, January was characterized by healthy mass table drop, strong direct VIP turnover and full occupancy in the hotels while Chinese New Year saw a more prolonged period of visitation and less concentration on specific days than we saw in 2024.\nIn fact, for the 14 days beginning January 29, and including the days after the holiday period, volumes were healthy with drop in turnover in line with 2024 and slot handle up, hold during the period was choppy, but volume indicators look good.\nTurning to Wynn Al Marjan Island in UAE, construction is rapidly progressing on the project with work now reaching the 35th floor of the hotel and over 4.6 million square feet of concrete and steel in place. As we discussed at our Investor Day in October, we believe the UAE will be a $3 billion to $5 billion gaming market over time and certainly the most exciting new market for our industry in decades.\nTo support this project and the early work we are doing to build our database and brand awareness in the region, we were pleased to announce in early January that we entered into an agreement to purchase Aspenols in Mayfair, London. This small but strategic asset provides a presence in Central London, where many of our future Wynn Al Marjan Island customers spend a meaningful amount of time.\nLastly, we are actively exploring and well positioned to capitalize on additional new market opportunities in attractive gateway cities. And we have strategic land banks in each of our new markets that provide an embedded long-term growth pipeline.\nMeanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as free cash flow grows, allowing us to increase the return of capital to shareholders through the recurring dividend and meaningful share repurchases. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $267.4 million in adjusted property EBITDA of $69.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.2%. EBITDA was down 1% year-on-year, and revenues were up slightly on a difficult comp from 2023, higher-than-normal table game hold positively impacted EBITDA by a little more than $30 million in the quarter, while volume metrics were positive, with drop essentially flat year-on-year and slot handle up 13%.\nThe OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in the quarter, up about 1% compared to the prior year. The team in Las Vegas continued to exercise strong cost discipline and have largely mitigated the bulk of our union related payroll and other benefits increases without impacting the guest experience.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $58.8 million, down year-over-year on a tough comp on revenue of $212.7 million with an EBITDA margin of 27.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side, with OpEx per day of $1.17 million, up only 2% year-on-year despite labor cost pressures in that market.\nThe Boston team have also done a great job of mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $292.8 million in the quarter, on $926.6 million of operating revenue, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 31.6% in the quarter. Higher-than-normal VIP hold benefited EBITDA by a little over $12 million in the quarter.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.59 million per day in Q4, up 1.2% year-on-year. The team has done a great job staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to grow over time.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design, planning and approval stages on several of our concession commitments, and as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we now expect total CapEx spend in 2025 inclusive of our concession-related commitments and other projects to range between $250 million and $300 million.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of $3.5 billion as of December 31, this was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. The combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.4 billion at 2024 adjusted property EBITDA, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x.\nOur strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allowed us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders. To that end, the Wynn Resorts Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on March 5, 2025, to stockholders of record as of February 24.\nAs Craig mentioned, we also repurchased 2.14 million shares for approximately $200 million during the quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to 4.35 million shares for an aggregate cost of $386 million. These share buybacks, together with our recurring dividend highlight our focus on and continued commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nFinally, we spent approximately $127 million on CapEx in the quarter, primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements in Las Vegas, concession-related in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\nAdditionally, we contributed $99 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $631.7 million. We estimate our remaining 40% pro rata share of the required equity is approximately $700 million to $775 million fully loaded for capitalized interest, fees and certain improvements on the Island.\nImportantly, we recently announced we finalized a $2.4 billion of financing package for the project from a diverse group of globally recognized lenders. This landmark transaction is the largest hospitality financing in the history of the UAE and indicative of the broad support for this project from the financial community and beyond.\nWe're very grateful for the support of our lenders and with the financing now in place, have achieved a significant milestone on the path to opening the project as planned in early 2027.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

All participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, and as always, thank you for joining us today. I want to start by saying thank you to my nearly 28,000 colleagues here at Wynn Resorts for delivering yet another record quarter. In this case, the best second quarter EBITDAR in the history of the company at $572 million. record quarters like this one further strengthen our conviction when deploying capital, whether through CapEx or share repurchases like those we executed in the second quarter and into the third quarter.\nWynn Las Vegas delivered $230 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a second quarter record and up 3% year-on-year on yet another very difficult comp, taking trailing 12-month EBITDAR to nearly $970 million. The quarter was led by 16% growth in hotel revenue along with 8% growth in slot handle and healthy table drop in the casino. Wynn Las Vegas continues to have the top-performing team here in Vegas. More recently, demand has remained healthy in 3Q with RevPAR up and slot handle broadly in line year-on-year during July, despite this year having 2 fewer weekend days.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $62 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. Lower than normal table hold masked what was actually a strong quarter across the property with record slot handle, strong table drop and record RevPAR in the hotel. More recently, demand has remained healthy through July with table drops, slot handle and RevPAR all up on a tough year-on-year comp.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $280 million of EBITDAR in the second quarter on slightly lower market share than we have experienced over the previous several quarters and slightly lower mass hold quarter-over-quarter. There has been a lot of chatter in the market about the elevated promotional environment in Macau with concessionaires jockeying for market share.\nOf course, while we are active every day in the hand-to-hand combat for market share, you can't take market share to the bank, and thus, we have remained -- we have continued to remain disciplined in our OpEx and player reinvestment levels, highlighted by our strong EBITDAR margin in the quarter, which was 250 basis points above 2Q 2019. We've seen this dynamic before, and we remain confident that our market-leading product and service levels position us well to compete effectively in the long term.\nTo that end, we were encouraged that our GGR market share moved back to our expected range in July, supported by strong mass table drop and 99% hotel occupancy during the month. Wynn Macau's long-term outlook remains very bright.\nOn the development front, we continue to elevate our product offering in Macau through new and innovative food and beverage concepts and unique programming. We also continue to advance construction work on our second major concession-related project, our destination food hall, which we expect to open in 2025.\nTurning to our Wynn Al Marjan Island development in the UAE. I just returned from several weeks in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah. Construction is rapidly progressing on the project with work now approaching the 15th floor of the hotel. The building now stands just over 90 meters, which is already the tallest building in the Emirate.\nDuring the second quarter, we contributed $357 million of equity to our UAE joint venture. This transaction included the purchase of our 40% pro rata share of all 155 acres of Island Three, the island on which Wynn Al Marjan sits. As a result, our joint venture now owns not only the land under Wynn Al Marjan, but also 70-plus acres of land for potential future development on the Island. Of course, we have banked land before in the U.S. and Macau, and we are confident that acquiring this sizable Marjan land bank will prove valuable over the long term.\nAs I have noted before, I believe the UAE is the most exciting new market for our industry in decades and our confidence in the demand and EBITDAR potential of Wynn Al Marjan continues to grow. We also made meaningful progress during the quarter on the debt financing for the project and expect that we will finalize that financing later in 2024. I remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. We have the best assets in the world's premier gaming markets. We also have an exciting high ROI development project in the UAE well underway, a development opportunity that is unique in our industry. And we are exploring potential greenfield opportunities in attractive gateway cities like New York and Bangkok.\nMeanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as free cash flow grows, allowing us to increase the return of capital to shareholders through the recurring dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Our best days lie ahead. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $230.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $628.7 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDAR margin of 36.6%. Lower-than-normal table games hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $5 million in Q2. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.2 million in Q2 compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to union-related payroll increases, along with higher variable costs due to increased volumes across the business.\nTurning to Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $62.1 million on revenue of $212.6 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29.2%. As Craig alluded to, our table game hold was below normal during the quarter. And if we normalize hold in both periods, EBITDAR would have increased approximately 2% year-on-year. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1.15 million, flat year-on-year and down sequentially. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $280.4 million in the quarter on $885.3 million of operating revenue. Hold was a mixed bag in the quarter as higher than normal hold at Palace was more than offset by lower than normal hold at Wynn Macau, particularly in our mass table business. All in, we estimate hold negatively impacted EBITDAR at the combined properties by around $3 million during the quarter. EBITDAR margin was 31.7% in the quarter, an increase of 250 basis points relative to Q2 2019. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.5 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 19% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 3% on a sequential basis.\nThe team has done a great job of staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.9 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. During the quarter, we continued to reduce gross debt, repaying approximately $170 million on our bank facilities, and we have now reduced company-wide gross debt by more than $1.1 billion over the past year.\nThe combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.4 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDAR, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders in both the U.S. and Macau. To that end, the Wynn Resorts Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 30, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2024.\nWe also opportunistically repurchased approximately 741,000 shares for $68 million during the quarter. Similarly, in June, Wynn Macau paid a dividend of $0.075 per share or USD 50 million, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $94 million, primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. Additionally, as Craig noted, we contributed $356.5 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $514.4 million, split approximately $300 million for Wynn Al Marjan and a little over $200 million for the Marjan land bank and related infrastructure.\nWe estimate our remaining 40% pro rata share of the required equity is approximately $900 million, fully loaded to capitalized interest, fees and certain improvements on the island. Importantly, as Craig noted, we've also made meaningful progress on the debt financing for the project with significant interest from a diverse group of banks, both locally and the region as well as internationally. We expect the financing will be completed later this year, and we will update you in due course. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are [ Linda Chen ], [ Frederic Luvisutto ] and [ Jenny Holiday ].\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie, and afternoon, everyone, as always. Thanks for joining us today.\nThe momentum that we generated in the business throughout 2023 continued into 2024 as we delivered all-time record property EBITDA of $647 million during the first quarter of 2020. I'm incredibly proud of all of our team members who remain so focused on delivering 5-star service and one-of-a-kind experiences to our guests. A heartfelt thank you to each of you.\nTurning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $246 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a first quarter record and up 6% year-on-year on a very difficult comp.\nAs we noted on our last call, most of the action in the quarter was concentrated in February as the combination of Super Bowl and Chinese New Year drove all-time record EBITDA during the month.\nQuarter was characterized by strong performance across our non-gaming businesses with revenue growing 16% year-on-year, led by 21% growth in hotel revenue along with healthy volumes in the casino.\nThrough our unique combination of the best service levels in the market, continuous reinvestment in our property and our only at win programming, we continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas.\nMore recently, our top line trends remained healthy in April with drop, Candle and RevPAR all up year-over-year on yet another difficult comp.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $63 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. The team in Boston successfully navigated a confluence of poor weather in January and inflationary pressures during the quarter as EBITDAR and revenue at the property were largely stable year-on-year. There were encouraging pockets of strength in the quarter with record slot handle and strong year-on-year growth in hotel revenue. More recently, demand has remained healthy through April with particular strength in slot handle and RevPAR.\nOn the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we have put this development on hold for the time being as we have been unable to reach an agreement with local authorities on certain financial terms. Though it's disappointing, we have numerous other development projects globally where we can redirect the capital we intended to deploy in Boston.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $340 million of EBITDA in the quarter on GGR market share that was above both the prior quarter and above our 2019 exit. We held above our expected range. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $320 million. The strength in our business has continued into Q2.\nIn the casino, our mass drop per day in April increased 30% versus April 2019. And on the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx drove healthy margins during April.\nWe were also pleased with the results during May Golden Week, particularly in light of unfavorable weather in the region. In the casino, mass drop per day increased 30% versus the comparable 2019 holiday period and approach levels seen during last Chinese New Year.\nOn the development front in Macau, we began initial demolition and construction work on our second concession-related project, our destination food home. We are well into design and planning for our other major concession-related CapEx commitments including our new event and entertainment center and a unique theater and show.\nTurning to Wynn Al Marjan in the UAE. Construction is rapidly advancing on the project. And as of this week, we are currently constructing the fourth floor of the hotel tower. You can find recent renderings and images of Wynn Al Marjan in a press release we issued yesterday ahead of a major travel convention taking place this week in Dubai. And I expect we will further update you on the advances we have made on the project later this year.\nFinally, we are actively considering greenfield development opportunities in New York City and potentially Thailand. In New York, we believe a full-scale Wynn integrated resort in Hudson Yards will drive meaningful incremental tax revenue, tourism and employment in the state. Despite the elongation of the RFA submission process in New York, we remain intrigued by the prospect of a Wynn resort in Manhattan.\nIn Thailand, it's early days, and we have yet to see the regulatory and licensing structures. Thailand is already a major tourism destination with significant tourism infrastructure and a world-class service culture so we will continue to closely monitor advancement of the legalization process.\nI remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. In Las Vegas, we remain at the pinnacle of the market with tremendous demand for what we offer. And in an inflationary environment like this, we have the luxury of being able to reprice our hotel rooms every day in order to take advantage of that demand.\nIn Macau, we continue to punch above our weight on a revenue per hotel room basis generating meaningful market share and substantial discretionary free cash flow. We also have a meaningful high ROI project underway in the UAE, along with potential greenfield developments in other attractive gateway cities.\nMeanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as does our outlook on future free cash flow. Our best days lie ahead.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $246.3 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $636.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.7%. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag given results in the Sportsbook, and we estimate a net $5 million benefit from higher than normal hold in the quarter.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.1 million in Q1 2024, up 9% year-over-year and in line with the increase in operating revenues as we successfully absorbed incremental OpEx related to Super Bowl programming, union-related payroll increases and other inflationary pressures.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63 million on revenue of $217.8 million with an EBITDA margin of 29%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side and excluding a $2 million benefit from a onetime item, OpEx per day was $1.19 million in Q1 2024, up around 2% year-over-year. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $339.6 million in the quarter on $998.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher than normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $19 million during the quarter. VIP hold was largely in the normal range with the hold impact primarily related to higher than normal hold on Wynn Palace mass table games.\nEBITDA margin was 34% in the quarter an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2023 and 310 basis points relative to Q1 2019. Overall, our strong margin expansion relative to 2019 has been driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.6 million per day in Q1, a decrease of 17% compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019. OpEx increased 3% on a sequential basis, well below the 10% increase in operating revenue. The team has done a great job staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.2 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2 billion in the U.S.\nOn the capital markets front, in February, we issued a $400 million add-on to the Wynn Resorts Finance 2031 unsecured notes with net proceeds along with cash on hand used to fund the tender and repurchase of $800 million of Wynn Las Vegas notes maturing in March 2025. Over the past 4 quarters, we've reduced company-wide gross debt by approximately $1 billion. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally, with our properties generating over $2.3 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDA together with our robust cash position, creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x.\nOur strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders. To that end, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 20, 2024.\nAdditionally, in late March, the Wynn Macau Board recommended the reinstatement of a dividend at $0.075 per share or USD 50 million highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders in both the U.S. and Macau.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $97.7 million primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. Additionally, we contributed $70 million of equity to the Wynn or Al Marjan Island JV project during the quarter, bringing the total equity contribution to date to approximately $160 million.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holiday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billing.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us again today. Well, what a quarter. And really what a year, every single member of the wind team should be incredibly proud of what they achieved together in 2023. Momentum in the business built throughout the year, and we ended on a high note with $632 million of property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, capping off a record year in which we generated nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA.\nWe see tremendous value in our business as evidenced by our buybacks in the quarter and are genuinely looking forward to 2024. The company is more diversified than it's ever been.\nIn Las Vegas, we continue to distance ourselves from peers as the leader in luxury and it's more evident than ever that we are the go-to spot for the best customers attending citywide events like F1. We have a growing business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins than in the past, is much less reliant on the volatile VIP segment and is increasingly well positioned to compete.\nAnd importantly, we have a substantial growth opportunity in the UAE that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our brand into new markets.\nTurning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $271 million of adjusted property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, up 24% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. While F1 was clearly a contributor, activity of the property was intense throughout the quarter, with RevPAR table drop slot handle and food and beverage revenue all well above what was a very strong quarter in 2022.\nIn fact, we had our best October, our best November and our best December ever in terms of EBITDA during Q4. We continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the Vegas team.\nMore recently, January 2024 looked a lot like January 2023 from an overall revenue perspective with hotel revenue particularly strong. That being said, January isn't where the action is this quarter. It's all about February. Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and for us, the best February in our history for group and convention.\nBetween Super Bowl and Chinese New Year, we have doubled the front money and credit that we had in 2023, and we expect record hotel revenue over Super Bowl. So a very active February will really set the tone for the first quarter.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $64 million of EBITDA during the quarter, similar to many other regional markets, demand at the property was largely stable year-on-year. Revenue decreased by about 0.5%, but the team has done a great job remaining disciplined on OpEx, driving a 2% year-over-year increase in EBITDA.\nMore recently, underlying demand has remained healthy through January although a couple of unfortunately timed winter storms had negatively impacted visitation during a few recent weekends.\nOn the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we recently received a key environmental approval and we are advancing through a few remaining items before construction can be yet.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $297 million of EBITDA in the quarter on market share that was consistent with the prior quarter and with 2019. While we held in the normal range in mass, we held a bit high in VIP. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $290 million or 94% of Q4 2019 levels. The strength in our business there has continued into Q1. In the casino, our mass drop per day in January increased 32% versus January 2019 and was up sequentially versus Q4.\nOn the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%, along with continued strength in tenant retail sales. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx control drove healthy margins during the month of January.\nOn the development front, we opened our first major concession-related capital project during Q4, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Aluminarium and initial customer feedback has been positive. We are deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our Destination Food Hall, the new event and entertainment center and a unique production show.\nLastly, turning to Wynn Al Marjan, construction continues on the project with much of the hotel tower and podium foundation now complete, and we are nearly ready to start going vertical on the hotel tower. Property is really going to be a stunner, and it's great to see the buildings start to take shape.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. In Las Vegas, we generated $270.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $696.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Higher than novel table games hold benefited EBITDA by around $10 million in Q4.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in Q4 '23, up 16% year-over-year, well below the 19% increase in revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was primarily driven by higher programming and staffing costs related to F1.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $64.4 million on revenue of $217.1 million with an EBITDA margin of 29.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of $1.14 million per day in Q4 '23, down 2% year-over-year, driving a 70 basis point increase in EBITDA margin. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $297 million in the quarter on $910.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher-than-expected hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $7 million during the quarter. Importantly, mass hold at both properties within the expected range during the quarter with the hold impact primarily related to the VIP side of the business.\nEBITDA margin was 32.6% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2019, driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.56 million per day in Q4, a decrease of 14% compared to $3 million in Q4 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2.45 billion in the U.S. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA in 2023. Together with our robust cash and liquidity position, creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally.\nFurther, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares to $139 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nWe will consider additional dividend increases at Wynn Resorts and the initiation of the dividend from Wynn Macau as the recovery progresses and the exact timing of our global capital deployment plans become more clear.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $113 million, primarily related to the par Villar renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jennie Holiday.\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, and as always, thank you for joining us today.\nI'll start here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $220 million of adjusted property EBITDA, up 12% on an incredibly difficult year-over-year comp. Yes, it was aided by high hold, but it was also despite the fact that we accrued during the quarter for the estimated increases associated with the new agreement with the culinary union. I got to tell you, activity at the property was frenetic during the quarter, with hotel occupancy restaurant covers casino visitation, table drop and slot handle all up over what was a very strong third quarter of 2022. As a result of all that activity, we produced third quarter records in gross gaming revenue, food and beverage revenue and hotel revenue with 10% year-over-year growth in RevPAR.\nWe continue to be at the top of our game here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the team who continue to deliver to our exacting standards even in the midst of significant customer volumes. Our top line trends remained strong through October with healthy GGR and strong year-over-year RevPAR growth during the month.\nLooking ahead, we have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, very healthy gaming market share and a robust programming calendar with F1 and Super Bowl just ahead of us. And while it certainly is an increasingly complex world out there between inflation, rates, geopolitics, things continue to feel pretty good around here.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $60 million of EBITDA during the quarter. Business at the property was largely stable year-on-year with revenue and EBITDA down about 1%, though there were some meaningful pockets of strength, including all-time property records for slot handle and hotel revenue. More recently, we were encouraged by the acceleration in the business we experienced during October with month-over-month growth in slot handle and table drop and strong RevPAR growth year-over-year. We will continue to closely monitor the ongoing Sumner Tunnel construction, which is expected to continue in fits and starts over the next 12 months, along with the general macroeconomic uncertainty that seems to have been impacting some of the regional gaming operators.\nOn the development across the street from Encore Boston Harbor, we have been asked by a state environmental agency to provide yet another round of analysis and documentation delaying our construction by approximately 3 months. We will continue to update you on this project, which will add meaningful amenities and EBITDA to Encore Boston Harbor.\nTurning to Macau, we generated $255 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was 85% of our pre-COVID levels. Hold was mixed in the quarter as we held high in our VIP business, which was more than offset by low hold on the mass table side. With mass now comprising the vast majority of our business, we are going to start normalizing for both VIP and MAX. To that end, we estimate fully normalized EBITDA in the quarter was $266 million or 87% of the third quarter of 2019 levels. Encouragingly, mass hold returned to the expected range at both properties in October. During the quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our properties with several key areas of the business trending well above 2019 levels.\nIn the casino, mass table drop increased 19% versus Q3 2019 and direct VIP turnover was 13% above Q3 2019. On the non-gaming side, our retail business continues to be incredibly strong with tenant retail sales up 24% on Q3 2019, and hotel revenue up 20% relative to the third quarter of 2019. Quality of our product and service, our relaunch wind Rewards loyalty program and our very robust non-gaming events calendar all helped to drive GGR market share in the quarter that was consistent with second quarter and in line with our share as we exited 2019. The strength in our business has continued in Q4 with mass drop in October, 24% above October 2019. The hotel occupancy and healthy tenant retail sales. On the development front in Macau, we expect our first concession-related capital project, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Aluminarium on a mesmerizing multimedia exhibit space to open before the end of the year. We're also deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our destination food hall the new event and entertainment center and a unique spectacle show. Lastly, construction continues on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE.\nMuch of the Hotel Tower Foundation is complete with nearly all of the piles supporting the 1,500 room tower in the ground. On the back of several recent regulatory developments in the UAE, I've noticed increased chatter about the opportunities there. So I want to take a moment and give you our perspective. We believe it's highly unlikely that every Emirate will ultimately avail themselves of the right to host an integrated resource. There's a whole bunch of reasons for this, ranging from cultural nuances to population density to varying degrees of need for the additional visitation. Our view is that it will likely be us and us alone for a multiyear period, given that we are well underway on construction now. And of course, we all know the advantages of being first as we have seen in other markets. After that, it may be a duopoly or an oligopoly of 3. But I find either ultimate market structure undaunting, given the database advantages of being first and the fact that we very successfully operate in the 2 most competitive markets in the world, Vegas and Macau. As I've said before, this is the most exciting new market opening in decades.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $219.7 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $619 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 35.5%, higher than normal hold benefited EBITDA by around $12 million in Q3 and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA was up slightly year-over-year. The strength in the quarter was broad-based across the business. Hotel revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $178.5 million, a new third quarter record on the back of a 9% increase in ADR and 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Our other non-gaming businesses were strong across food and beverage, entertainment and retail, all up nicely year-on-year.\nIn the casino, our GGR increased around 22% year-over-year, driven by a 7.6% year-over-year increase in slot handle and a 6.5% increase in table drop along with higher table games hold. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.1 million in Q3 2023, up 14% year-over-year due to variable costs associated with revenue increases, roughly $10 million of nonrecurring items and certain structural changes including an accrual for the anticipated increases associated with a new union contract, our annual cost of living adjustments for nonunion employees and the launch of our production show.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $60.5 million on revenue of $210.4 million, both down around 1% year-on-year. EBITDA margin was 28.8%, broadly in line with Q3 2022. As Craig noted, business was largely stable year-on-year. In the casino, we generated $182.6 million of GGR, down 1% year-on-year as record slot handle was offset by lower table games volumes. Our non-gaming revenue was flat year-over-year at $54.4 million with record hotel revenue offset by lower food and beverage revenues. As noted on our prior call and as Craig mentioned earlier, business volumes at the property were impacted by the Sumner Tunnel restoration project, which is expected to continue intermittently over the next 12 months or so. While the tunnel construction is out of our control, we have stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of approximately $1.13 million per day in Q3 2023, down 0.5% year-over-year and down around 2% sequentially. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $255 million in the quarter on $819.8 million of operating revenue. We estimate lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $11 million during the quarter with higher than normal hold at Wynn Palace more than offset by lower than normal hold at Wynn Macau. We saw particular strength in [Indiscernible] direct CIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenues, all above Q3 2019 levels.\nEBITDA margin was 31.1% in the quarter, an increase of 300 basis points relative to Q3 2019 with Wynn Palace's margins reaching 33.7% or 660 basis points above Q3 2019 levels. Our concession-related non-gaming programming have accelerated over the past few months, with the favor 3x3 basketball tournament that Di Vinci Immersive Art Exhibition, a Hypercar Exhibition, some DJ events and several other well-received concerts and culinary events. EBITDA margin strength was driven by a combination of a favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.4 million per day in Q3, a decrease of 20% compared to $3 million in Q3 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we are well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time. In terms of CapEx, we are currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments and as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very net terms. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $300 million and $400 million in total between Q4 2023 and the end of 2024.\nTurning to Wind Interactive. You will recall we announced in August that we decided to rationalize the business to primarily focus on Massachusetts and Nevada, where we have a physical presence. As a result, our EBITDA burn rate decreased substantially both sequentially and year-over-year to $4.9 million in Q3 2023.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.3 billion as of September 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $2.5 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties run rating over $2.1 billion of annualized property EBITDA, together with our robust cash and liquidity creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally.\nTo that end, we repurchased $400 million of our 2025 Wynn Las Vegas senior notes at a discount to par during the quarter. Further, the board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on November 30th to stockholders of record as of November 20, 2023. We also repurchased approximately 597,000 shares, $56.2 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $114 million, primarily related to the [Indiscernible] Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements that Wynn Los Vegas. Concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings; Brian Gullbrants; and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, what a quarter. Who would have thought just 6 months ago that we would be run rating $2.2 billion of property EBITDA? To put that in context, peak annual property EBITDA for the company was $2 billion in 2018. Yet here we are today. We have a more diversified business with the addition of Encore Boston Harbor. We have a business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins into a resurging market, a business in Las Vegas that is more relevant than ever and is producing nearly double its 2018 EBITDA on much higher margins, and we have a very substantial growth opportunity in the UAE, the most exciting new gaming market in decades.\nI see tremendous value in our business, and I know our brightest days are ahead of us. Our path is the clearest it has been in years, and our team is committed and energized.\nTurning to the quarter and starting in Vegas, Wynn Las Vegas delivered $224 million of adjusted property EBITDA. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA was up 3% on a very difficult year-over-year comp. We saw strength all over the place: the casino, the hotel, the restaurants, retail, you name it, all supported by a consumer that seems more than willing to continue spending on unique luxury experiences. Now we obviously have a very particular customer type skewing heavily to luxury, and we continue to closely monitor whether or not interest rates and inflation begin to impact that consumer. But so far, so good. In fact, drop, handle and RevPAR are all up year-over-year in July. And that's obviously before we get into the latter portion of the year, which has a number of tailwinds from citywide programming.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $69 million of EBITDAR, an all-time property record. We generated record GGR in the casino, led by strong growth in slot handle and the addition of retail sports betting earlier this year. On the non-gaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue, driven by both ADR and occupancy. On the development front in Boston, we're advancing our East of Broadway expansion project now.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $246 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was 72% of pre-COVID levels. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag in the quarter as we held high in our VIP business, but that was more than offset by low hold on the mass table side. We saw strength across the property with several components of the business above 2019 levels. In the casino, mass table drop increased 4% versus Q2 2019, despite the fact that portions of Wynn Macau's casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. The quality of our product and service, the relaunch of our loyalty program and our very robust nongaming events calendar all helped drive 14.2% market share in the quarter, consistent with our share as we exited 2019.\nOn the non-gaming side, our retail business continues to be incredibly strong, with tenant retail sales increasing 47% relative to 2Q 2019. Looking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been impressive, building through the second quarter. The strength has continued into Q3, with mass drop per day in July exceeding what we experienced in each month in Q2 and reaching 120% of daily mass drop in 2019. In July, we also continued to experience robust hotel occupancy and very healthy tenant retail sales. On the development front, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years.\nLastly, construction is now underway on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE, with our [ seacant ] walls and soil compaction complete and over 40% of the required hotel piles in the ground. As I said earlier, this is the most exciting new market opening in decades, and we will bring our A game to this development. Our 40% equity ownership and management license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $224.1 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $578.1 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.8%. Slightly lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $2 million in Q2, and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year. Our hotel revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $177.8 million, a new second quarter record, on the back of an increase of 24,000 occupied room nights due to rooms that were out of service for renovations in Q2 2022. ADR occupancy and RevPAR were all up slightly compared to Q2 2022, despite the increase in available room nights, highlighting the appeal of our newly renovated room product. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail. In the casino, our GGR increased around 2% year-over-year, driven by a 14.8% year-over-year increase in slot handle and table drops that was roughly flat.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $69.1 million, an all-time property record. EBITDA margin was 31.1%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $193 million of GGR, a property record, with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year to $55.1 million, with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side, with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, of approximately $1.15 million in Q2 2023, up 3.6% year-over-year on increased business volumes and down 1% sequentially.\nAs you may have seen in the press, we were pleased to recently sign new union agreements that provide our employees with competitive wages, benefits and a best-in-class working environment that reflects our Wynn service standards. We expect the incremental OpEx from the new agreements to be partially offset by cost efficiencies we have identified in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Additionally, I would like to note that business volumes in Q3 are temporarily being negatively impacted by the Sumner Tunnel restoration project the City of Boston is conducting that will be ongoing through August 31. The impact is primarily being felt in our table games business, as both slots and nongaming revenue continued to grow year-on-year in July.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $246.2 million in the quarter on $769.9 million of operating revenue. As Craig noted, we held high in our VIP business, but this was more than offset by lower-than-expected hold on the mass table side. We were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter, with particular strength in mass casino drop, direct VIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenue all above Q2 2019 levels. EBITDA margin was 32% in the quarter, an increase of 280 basis points relative to Q2 2019, with Wynn Palace's margin reaching 33.4%, or 690 basis points above Q2 2019 levels.\nEBITDA margin strength was driven by a combination of a favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. In fact, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.2 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 29% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 2% from Q1 despite the meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitment. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023 through 2024, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $300 million and $400 million.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive, our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $15 million in Q2 2023. Our team continues to stay disciplined on costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $2.9 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties run rating approximately $2.2 billion of annualized property EBITDA, together with our robust cash and liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile for the company globally.\nWe're also pleased to announce that the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of August 21, 2023, highlighting our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $92 million, primarily related to the [ far biller ] renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Cameron -- I'm sorry, to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday.\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'm pleased to say that after 3 years of suspension, today, we announced that we are resuming payment of a quarterly dividend, initially $0.25 per share. We have a number of growth projects in flight that require capital and will ultimately add meaningful EBITDA to our business. But with Macau returning to profitability and North America continuing to perform well above historical levels, we have sufficient financial flexibility to also return capital to shareholders.\nI also want to express appreciation to our 27,000-plus team who were once again recently recognized by Forbes Travel Guide with 24 Five Star Awards, the most of any independent hotel company in the world. Thank you for all that you do.\nTurning to Las Vegas. I have to tell you, it's a fascinating time in our business. Despite the confluence of high inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and increasingly difficult year-over-year comps, Wynn Las Vegas delivered an all-time record in Q1 with $232 million of adjusted property EBITDA, supported by a consumer that continues to feel flush. We also subsequently delivered the best April in the history of the property. We continue to invest heavily in people, programming and the building to further distance ourselves as the clear leader in luxury in Vegas.\nLooking ahead, we currently have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power, healthy drop in handle and a robust programming calendar, particularly in the back half of the year. Yet I continue to watch the macro factors that I mentioned earlier, and I will note that with Q2 '23, we will begin comping against some very strong prior year quarters. Lastly, just as I have the past several quarters, I will continue to tell you exactly what we're seeing. And right now, things feel good around here.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDAR. We saw strength across the casino in terms of table drop, slot handle and overall GGR. On the nongaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into Q2 with EBITDA per day in April largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters.\nWe also launched retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor in Q1, which helped drive a 20% increase in sign-ups to our Wynn Rewards loyalty program year-to-date. I expect the book will continue to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time.\nOn the development front in Boston, we finalized the interiors and began to buy out structural materials for our upcoming projects across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $156 million of EBITDA in the quarter with lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacting EBITDA by about $10 million. In the casino, mass table drop reached 82% of Q1 2019 levels, and our VIP hold normalized market share was over 14% during the quarter despite unusually low hold in our mass business at Wynn Macau and the fact that significant portions of Wynn Macau's East casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. Encouragingly, that market share was consistent with full year 2019 levels.\nOn the nongaming side, our retail business was incredibly strong with tenant retail sales increasing 60% compared to the first quarter of 2019, once again highlighting the strength of our premium consumer.\nLooking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been very impressive, building through the first quarter and accelerating into April. Who would have thought even 6 months ago that the market would be run rating north of $22 billion of annual GGR.\nIn April, our mass drop per day increased versus Q1, our direct VIP turnover per day increased meaningfully versus Q1, and occupancy and retail sales were very healthy. More recently, the May Golden Week holiday period was particularly strong, outperforming Golden Week 2019 in several key areas. In the casino, our overall mass table drop during the holiday period was nearly 10% above 2019 Golden Week levels, and our direct VIP turnover was more than double 2019 levels.\nOutside of gaming, our tenant retail sales increased 36% compared to Golden Week 2019, and our hotel occupancy was 95%. Performance during and after the quarter was skewed towards Wynn Palace driven both by the mix of customers that have returned to Macau in the initial reopening wave and the renovation-related closures at Wynn Macau that I mentioned earlier. We are making a number of changes and improvements to Wynn Macau that I expect will drive longer-term market share gain. In the meantime, I expect that Wynn Palace will continue to pace ahead of Wynn Macau in the recovery.\nOn the development front in Macau, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years. We look forward to telling you more in due course.\nLastly, I hope that you were all able to review the information we provided a couple of weeks ago on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE. If you haven't listened to the presentation or read through the slide deck, you can find both on our IR website. I'm incredibly proud of the program and design elements we have put together thus far. And as we noted in the presentation, we think the resort will generate between $450 million and $600 million of steady-state EBITDA. The combination of our 40% equity ownership in the project along with our management and license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated an all-time record of $231.6 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $586.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Higher-than-normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $4 million in Q1. Our hotel occupancy was 88.8% in the quarter, up 1,190 basis points year-over-year and up 620 basis points versus Q1 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $493 during Q1 '23, up 14.1% versus Q1 '22 and 46% above Q1 2019 levels.\nOur other nongaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our Q1 '23 slot handle increased 33.5% year-over-year and with 99% of our Q1 2019 level. Similarly, our table drop was up 9.6% year-over-year and was 49% of our Q1 2019 levels. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 39.5% in the quarter.\nOn a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year at approximately 1,400 basis points compared to Q1 2019. OpEx excluding gaming tax per day was $3.7 million in Q1 '23, which was flat sequentially and up 20% compared to Q1 2019 levels but well below the 46% increase in operating revenues.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63.4 million with EBITDA margin of 29.3%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $191 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $50.9 million with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q1 '23. This is up relative to Q1 '22 on increased business volumes and flat sequentially.\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 '22. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $155.8 million in the quarter on $600.1 million of operating revenues. Lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $10 million in Q1. As Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter with particular strength in mass casino and luxury retail sales. Our OpEx excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.3 million per day in Q1, a decrease compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019 and up modestly from Q4 despite meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted last quarter, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $21.1 million in Q1 '23. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiencies.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $1.6 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.1 billion in the U.S.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston with the properties generating over $1.1 billion of adjusted property EBITDA in the 12 months through March 31, together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S.\nAs Craig noted, with our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, we're pleased to announce that the Board approved the resumption of our quarterly dividend with a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on June 6, 2023, to stockholders of record as of May 23, 2023, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $124 million primarily related to the spa and villa renovations and F&B enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Weitman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not go true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO, Treasurer & Director, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we prepared for this call, I looked at an old analyst note that was published after our Q4 2019 earnings. The expectation for 2022 EBITDAR at Wynn Las Vegas in that note was $482 million.\nHere we are 3 years in the global pandemic later and Wynn Las Vegas just printed $816 million of normalized adjusted property EBITDAR, $816 million. I'm confident that this is an all-time record for a stand-alone Las Vegas Strip property. And mind you, we did not deliver this result by nickel and diming on service standards and reducing staff to drive operating leverage.\nThe team did it by focusing on what we do best. Great products, great service, great programming, and it showed in our market share and pricing power. The Wynn Las Vegas team absolutely crushed it in 2022. Our business in Vegas is stronger and more relevant than it has ever been.\nI'll talk more about the fourth quarter in Vegas in our outlook in a moment. Turning to several other significant events. I'd like to touch on our concession renewal and the reopening of Macau. I was in Macau for nearly 3 weeks in December. And after going through the then required quarantine, I was fortunate to attend the signing ceremony for our new concession.\nI'm proud of the plan that we put forward as part of the concession renewal and believe that the CapEx and programming we proposed will be additive to our business there over the coming years. I would like to thank the government of the Macau for their faith in us. And importantly, I would like to thank the Wynn Macau team for their dedication to our business over the past 3 very difficult years.\nFortunately, recent actions by both Macau and Mainland authorities to reopen the market give us great confidence that the difficulties are behind us in the near-term future there are much brighter. Over the past several weeks, we've welcomed back an increasing number of guests as the region has reopened to travel and tourism in a meaningful way.\nWith our premium product and service levels, we are well positioned to lead the post-COVID recovery in Macau, and our strengths were evident during the recent Chinese New Year holiday period. In the casino, mass table drop reached 95% of 2019 Chinese New Year levels with strong play across the spectrum from premium mass to core mass.\nIn direct VIP turnover was 40% above pre-COVID Chinese New Year levels. And importantly, we estimate that our hold-normalized GGR market share during the month of January was consistent with 2019 levels despite all the changes in the junket environment, define the expectations of those who continue to incorrectly believe that we are solely of VIP-focused organization.\nOn the non-gaming side, hotel occupancy was 96%, and our tenant retail sales increased 34% compared to Chinese New Year 2019. Overall, during the Chinese New Year period, we delivered our strongest EBITDAR performance since the onset of the pandemic, approximately $4 million of normalized EBITDAR per day.\nTurning back to Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas turned in a fourth quarter record with $219 million of EBITDAR. We saw broad-based strength across casino, hotel, F&B, entertainment and retail, all well above Q4 2021 levels despite the difficult year-over-year comps. Our investment in people, facilities and programming and our team's deep sense of personal ownership of our business continue to drive growth.\nWe continue to monitor economic trends and forward bookings at Wynn Las Vegas. We're encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into Q1. Similarly, our forward-looking indicators also remain quite strong despite well-known macro concerns as room bookings are pacing at or above pre-COVID-19 levels on substantially higher ADRs.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDAR. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue and on the non-gaming side with strong hotel revenue driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into the first quarter with EBITDAR per day in January, largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters.\nWe were also pleased to launch retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor last week, averaging a little over $0.5 million a day in handle over the first 6 days, which is about 80% of the average daily handle at Wynn Las Vegas.\nDuring those 6 days, we also signed up about 30% more Wynn Rewards members than normal. We continue to expect the book to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time. We also continue to advance our plans for our upcoming development project across the street from the property that will include incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nAt Wynn Interactive, our overall EBITDAR burn rate in the quarter ticked up sequentially to $28 million due to a well-publicized World Series bet that went against us. Adjusted for that single bet, burn was roughly flat. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiency. We're looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for WynnBET in Massachusetts with the combination of our recently launched retail book and the expected upcoming launch of online sports betting.\nLastly, we are quickly advancing our planning for Wynn Al Marjan Island, our integrated resort in the UAE. We're in the late stages of programming for the resort, and I expect we will be driving piles for the foundation of the property by the middle of the year. I also expect we will share renderings, programming and plans publicly over the next few months.\nThe more time we spend in that market, the more confident we are in the project. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a fourth quarter record of $219.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $585.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $10.5 million in Q4. Our hotel occupancy was 89.9% in the quarter, up 350 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points versus Q4 2019.\nImportantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $492 during Q4 2022, up 11.8% versus Q4 2021 and 53% above Q4 2019 levels. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across F&B, entertainment, and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q4 2022 slot handle increased 20.9% year-over-year and with 69% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, our table drop was up 1.1% year-over-year and was 43% above Q4 2019 levels despite still suppressed international play during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDAR margin of 37.4% in the quarter.\nOn a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDAR margin was up approximately 1,300 basis points compared to Q4 2019. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $3.8 million in Q4 2022, up 25% compared to Q4 2019 levels but well below the 59% increase in operating revenue.\nIn Boston, before getting into the details, I'd like to point out that following the closing of the sale leaseback transaction on December 1, we're now reporting adjusted profit to EBITDAR for this business.\nIn Q4 2022, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $63.3 million with EBITDAR margin of 29%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and non-gaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $190 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our non-gaming revenue grew 13% year-over-year to a record $56.8 million with particular strength in the hotels, driven by 93.9% occupancy and a $404 ADR.\nWe've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q4 2022. This was a decrease of over 8% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and up modestly relative to Q3 2022. As we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDAR and OpEx comps were impacted by a combination of contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 2022, along with a non-recurring benefit of $2 million in Q4 last year. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDAR loss of $59.1 million in the quarter on $190.3 million of operating revenues, lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $25 million in Q4. While the COVID situation in the region was challenging during Q4, as Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the recent Chinese holiday period.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2 million per day in Q4, a decrease compared to $2.4 million in Q4 2021. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer-term, we are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of the new concession, we approach the tender process very prudently, carefully balancing our commitments to the government with our responsibilities to our shareholders and, of course, our liquidity position. We're currently advancing through the design and planning stages, for these projects require a number of government approvals creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near-term.\nAs such, for 2023, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million. Our future non-gaming investments, including new theater set to be home of a unique spectacle show and innovative food halls and an events and entertainment center. As Craig noted, we believe these investments play into our strength as we have a demonstrated track record of introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and ultimately, strong shareholder returns.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDAR burn rate increased sequentially to $28.3 million in Q4 2022. However, adjusting for the well-publicized World Series that Craig mentioned, it was roughly flat with our Q3 2022 burn rate of $17.7 million.\nThe team continues to control costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $952 million of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.5 billion in the U.S.\nThese numbers exclude the undrawn $500 million intercompany revolving credit facility when results entered into with Wynn Macau. We were pleased to close the sale leaseback transaction for the real estate of Encore Boston Harbor on December 1 with gross proceeds of $1.7 billion, further bolstering our already strong liquidity position.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston, with the properties generating $1.04 billion of adjusted property EBITDAR during 2022 together with our robust liquidity creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S.\nWith our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, I'd like to note our intention to repay our upcoming May 2023, Wynn Las Vegas bond maturity with cash from the balance sheet, reducing our domestic gross leverage by $500 million.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $27 million, primarily related to normal course maintenance. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nAnd I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO, Treasurer & Director, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before I get into the quarter, I'd like to thank the cast, crew and producers of Awakening, our new show at Wynn Las Vegas, which successfully opened on Monday. The show is yet another example of our willingness to innovate and push the envelope to drive the strip forward. I'm incredibly proud of the team behind the show.\nI'll kick off in Las Vegas, where the team turned in a third quarter record with $196 million of EBITDA or approximately $207 million adjusted for lower-than-normal holds. We saw broad-based strength across casino, hotel, food and beverage and retail, all well above third quarter 2021 levels despite the difficult year-over-year comps. The comparison to third quarter 2019 is even more impressive with our EBITDA more than doubling on a 36% increase in revenue. Our investment in people, facilities and programming and our team's deep sense of ownership continue to elevate Wynn Las Vegas above our peers. This quarter once again highlights the benefit of that deliberate investment strategy.\nLooking ahead, encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into the fourth quarter. In fact, our EBITDA during October was an all-time monthly record for the property. Similarly, our forward-looking indicators also remain quite strong despite well-known macro concerns as room bookings are pacing at or above pre-COVID levels on substantially higher ADRs. Near term, we expect the normal seasonal pattern to hold during the remainder of Q4, with some of the usual softness surrounding Thanksgiving, followed by a strong close to the year in the latter half of December.\nTurning to Boston, like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $61 million of EBITDA. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue and on the nongaming side with record hotel revenue driven by strength in both ADR and occupancy. These trends have continued into Q4, with EBITDA per day in October consistent with the third quarter levels.\nLooking ahead, we remain excited about sports betting in the Commonwealth, which is expected to kick off early next year. Our retail sports book there will soon be a significant opportunity for customer acquisition. We also continue to finalize our plans for our upcoming development project across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nIn Macau, the market continues to be challenging with market-wide GGR in the third quarter only reaching approximately 8% of the third quarter of 2019 levels, and our results have reflected that. Our team has done a fantastic job controlling costs in a very challenging operating environment through a combination of decreases in payroll and fixed OpEx. As a result, despite the nearly 2-week closure of casinos in the market in July, our overall EBITDA loss in the third quarter was $66 million, which was a meaningful improvement from a loss of $90 million in the second quarter even after adjusting for a $7 million bad debt credit that benefited the results in the third quarter.\nMore recently, we did see some encouraging pockets of demand during the October holiday period, particularly in our direct VIP business, where turnover was actually slightly above the comparable 2019 holiday period. And in our retail business, where tenant sales reached 74% of 2019 levels. This once again highlights the strong demand for Macau's unique tourism offering during periods when the market is accessible.\nThe authorities in Macau continued to advance the concession process according to the preestablished time line. We were pleased to submit our concession tender application in September, and the government is currently reviewing the proposals with decisions expected to be made by year-end. Long term, we remain excited about the prospects from Macau with so much pent-up demand for travel and tourism in Asia.\nAt Wynn Interactive, our overall EBITDA burn rate declined to $18 million in Q3 from $21 million in the second quarter of 2022, on the back of strong cost controls and improved marketing efficiency. We are looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for Wynn in Massachusetts.\nLastly, we're advancing quickly on our planning for Wynn Marjan, our integrated resort in the UAE. We're in the late stages of programming for the resort. Given the pristine beach setting and the somewhat malleable nature of the man-made island, we have an incredible canvas with which to work and design something truly unique. I expect we will share renderings, programming and plans more publicly in early 2023. I also expect we will be driving piles for the foundation of the property by the middle of next year. We look forward to sharing more details with you about this exciting project in due course.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig.\nAt Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a third quarter record of $195.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $544.4 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by about $12 million in Q3. Our hotel occupancy was 88.8% in the quarter, up 580 basis points year-over-year and up 90 basis points versus Q3 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience. With our overall ADR reaching $426 during Q3 2022, up 8.7% versus Q3 2021 and 39% above Q3 2019 levels. Our other nongaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above prepandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q3 2022 slot handle increased 31.6% year-over-year and was 72.2% above Q3 2019 levels. Similarly, our table drop was up 12.5% year-over-year, and was 32.4% above Q3 2019 levels despite still suppressed international play during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 36% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 1,300 basis points compared to Q3 2019.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, was $3.6 million in Q3 2022, up 10% compared to Q3 2019 levels, but well below the 36% increase in revenue due to lower headcount and broad-based cost efficiencies in areas that do not impact the guest experience. We remain committed to maintaining a cost structure that appropriately balances margins and our exacting service standards. In Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDA of $61.1 million in Q3 2022 with EBITDA margin of 28.9%.\nWe saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $184 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 33% year-over-year, with particular strength in the hotel, driven by 97% occupancy and a $398 ADR. We stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, of approximately $1.1 million in Q3 2022. This was a decrease of over 10% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and broadly in line with Q2 2022.\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by a combination of contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 2022, along with a onetime benefit of $3 million in Q3 of last year. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDA loss of $65.6 million in the quarter on $115.6 million of operating revenue as the COVID situation in the region has continued to suppress visitation. As Craig noted, while the business has remained challenging, we experienced some encouraging pockets of demand during the October Golden Week holiday period, particularly in our direct VIP and retail businesses.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $1.6 million per day in Q3, a sequential decrease compared to $1.9 million per day in Q2 2022. The team has done a great job remaining declined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate improved to $17.7 million in Q3 2022, from $21 million in Q2 2022, primarily driven by improved marketing efficiency and disciplined OpEx control.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $2.8 billion as of September 30. This was comprised of $997 million of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.8 billion in the U.S. These numbers exclude the undrawn $500 million intercompany revolving credit [facility, Wynn Resorts entered into] with Wynn Macau.\nOur previously announced sale leaseback transaction for the real estate of Encore Boston Harbor remains on track to close before the end of the year. Pro forma for the transaction, we have approximately $4.4 billion of consolidated global cash and liquidity.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston, with the properties generating trailing 12-month EBITDA of over $1 billion, together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy pro forma leverage profile in the U.S. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $87 million, primarily related to the Awakening theater at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before getting into the quarter, I'd really like to thank our 27,000 team members globally. 2020 so far has been very different in Macau than it has been in North America. Our folks in Macau have endured what I know is a difficult period of isolation and volatility while our teams in Las Vegas and Boston have responded admirably to meaningfully elevated business volumes.\nTo those operating in both circumstances, thank you. I appreciate you. Starting in Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas turned in another all-time record quarter with $227 million of EBITDA and broad-based strength across casino, hotel, food and beverage and retail, all well above 2Q 2019 levels. In fact, our EBITDA this quarter was over 40% above the pre-COVID Las Vegas Strip EBITDA record also delivered by Wynn Las Vegas in 2014.\nA few other all-time quarterly records to call out: record EBITDA margin, record slot handle in Wynn, record non-baccarat table Wynn, record hotel revenue and record revenue from restaurants and bars. Meanwhile, our customer satisfaction scores in the first half of 2022 were up 3% over the first half of 2019. Our performance in Las Vegas speaks for itself.\nLooking ahead, while we are keenly aware of the macro environment and the uncertainty facing the economy, we've been encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into Q3. In fact, our forward bookings continue to pace at pre-COVID levels on substantially higher ADRs. July was very strong for us with occupancy of 91%.\nWe expect the usual seasonal slowdown in August with occupancy declining in the mid- to high 80s before accelerating back to the low 90s in September as group's return in large numbers. While we haven't seen any noticeable signs of weakness in our current operations or in our outlook, we are watching this closely. Our experience during the pandemic has made us nimbler than ever, and we are confident that we can adapt quickly to changes in the economic landscape, should they arise.\nTurning to Boston. Encore also had a great quarter, generating $64 million of EBITDA, a second quarter record for the property. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue, and on the non-gaming side, we generated record hotel revenue with particular strength in cash ADR and occupancy. The positive momentum has continued into Q3. And again, similar to Las Vegas, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown. We were happy to see the Massachusetts legislature pass the sports betting bill and having already constructed a Sports Book at Encore Boston Harbor in 2021, we expect that retail sports betting will soon be a significant opportunity for property-wide customer acquisition in Boston.\nWe also continue to finalize our plans for our upcoming development projects across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. Design and planning for that project is on schedule, and we are excited for our next phase of growth in Boston.\nIn Macau, the market continues to be very difficult with market-wide GGR in July, only reaching approximately 2% of July '19 levels. Our results have reflected that in roll, drop, hotel occupancy and EBITDA. Overall, our EBITDA loss in Q2 was $90 million, which was negatively impacted by around $8 million from low VIP holds. So on a normalized basis, our EBITDA loss was $900,000 per day in 2Q. And despite the nearly 2-week market-wide casino closure in July, our EBITDA loss has been comparable at approximately $1 million per day quarter-to-date in Q3. Our team has done a fantastic job controlling costs in a very challenging operating environment through a combination of decreases in payroll and fixed OpEx.\nSeveral weeks ago, we announced some important leadership changes in Macau with Linda Chen moving into the role of President early next year; Frederic Luvisutto moving into the role of COO for the entire Macau business; and Craig Fullalove, assuming the role of CFO and CIO for the business. I know many of you know and as I do respect Ian immensely, so I'm pleased that he will remain at the company in an advisory role through 2023. I have immense confidence in Linda, Frederic and Craig and know that they are the right team for the future.\nThe authorities in Macau continue to advance the concession process according to the preestablished time line. We're currently working through our response to the concession tender RFP. Longer term, we remain excited about the prospects for Macau with so much pent-up demand for travel and tourism in Asia. Our market-leading assets and strong liquidity position us well to thrive as visitation returns to the market over time.\nAt Wynn Interactive, the strategy we implemented late last year to manage the business with a long-term shareholder-friendly view is working with our overall EBITDA burn rate declining to $21 million in Q2 from $32 million in 1Q, despite a 3% quarter-over-quarter decline in total turnover due to the seasonally weak second quarter sports calendar. We are looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for WynnBET in Massachusetts both in digital and retail sports betting.\nLastly, the design and programming for our project in the UAE are really coming along, and I grow more excited about the opportunity every day. The project parking along a beautiful white sand beach will contain a 200,000 square foot casino, an extensive food and beverage portfolio and numerous forms of entertainment and spectacle. The more time I spend in this project, the more I'm convinced in our ability to build robust gaming and non-gaming businesses.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated an all-time quarterly record of $226.7 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $561.1 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Higher than normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $6 million in Q2.\nOur hotel occupancy was 90.5% quarter, up 40 basis points versus Q2 2019. Importantly, we stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching $460 during Q2 2022, 38% above Q2 2019 levels.\nOur other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage and retail, which were also well above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q2 2022 slot handle was 63% above Q2 2019 levels, and our table dropped was 28% above Q2 2019 level, despite still suppressed international plays during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 40.4% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up over 1,200 basis points compared to Q2 2019.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $3.5 million in Q2 2022, in line with Q2 2019 levels despite a 21% increase in revenue due to lower head count and broad-based cost efficiencies in areas that do not impact guest experience. We remain committed to maintaining our cost structure that appropriately balance the market on our guest service standards.\nIn Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDA at $63.7 million through Q2 2022, with EBITDA margin at 13.3%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and non-gaming. In the casino, we generated $181 million of GGR, a property record with strength across both tables and slots. Our non-gaming revenue grew 78% year-over-year with particular strength in the hotel, driven by 94.1% occupancy and a [$309] APR.\nAs Craig noted earlier, Q2 strength continued into Q3 as consumer spending on the unique experience remains strong. We stay disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.1 million in Q2 2022. This was a decrease of approximately 13% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and up modestly relative to Q1 2022 on higher revenue and higher payroll. As we've previously foreshadowed, contractual labor agreements added around $45,000 per day for our OpEx base beginning late in the quarter. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered a EBITDA loss of $90.3 million in the quarter on $117.2 million of operating revenue as the COVID situation in the region has continued [press visitation].\nAs Craig noted, lower-than-normal VIP holds negatively impacted our EBITDA by around $8 million during the quarter. Businesses remained challenging into Q3 as local COVID outbreaks in Macau observed a shutdown of integrated resorts for nearly 2 weeks during July. Despite the closure, our quarter-to-date EBITDA burn was approximately $1 million per day, in line with Q2.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $1.9 million per day in Q2, a sequential decrease compared to $2.1 million in Q1 2022. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive . In Q2, the business generated approximately $704 million in total turnover, a decline of 3% sequentially versus Q1 due to a seasonally weaker sport calendar. Decreases in marketing expense and other OpEx drove an improvement in our EBITDA burn rate of $21 million in Q2 2022 from $31.5 million in Q1 2022.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $3.1 billion as of June 30. This is comprised of $1.3 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. These numbers exclude the $500 million intercompany revolving credit facility, Wynn Resort and Wynn (inaudible) with Wynn Macau, which further bolsters our already strong liquidity position in Macau and highlights the continued confidence we have in the long-term prospects for that business.\nOur previously announced sale leaseback transactions at a real estate Encore Boston Harbor remains on track for a Q4 close. Pro forma for the transaction, we have approximately $4.7 billion of consolidated global cash and liquidity. Importantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston with the property generating trailing 12-month EBITDA of just over $1 billion together with our robust liquidity creates a very healthy pro forma domestic leverage profile. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $90 million primarily related to the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel and the theater renovation.\nWith that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Vincent Zahn, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.\n\nVincent Zahn\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Ciaran Carruthers, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor Federal Securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Wynn Macau, Limited\n\nThanks, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'd like to start by saying that I'm genuinely honored to be speaking to you as the CEO of Wynn Resorts. I joined WYNN in 2017 because I had spent much of my career admiring the company for its dedication to its craft and to its people. I'm excited to lead the company forward, and I know that our best days are ahead of us.\nBefore we talk about the fourth quarter, I'd like to give you some additional context around a couple of transactions that we've announced over the past few weeks.\nFirst, let's touch on the sale leaseback of our real estate at Encore Boston Harbor that we announced today. We discussed the sale of real estate on past earnings calls, and we've always maintained that we believe our valuation over any reasonable period of time reflects the value of our real estate. We believe that to be the case today.\nSo why execute a sale leaseback? A sale-leaseback is after all, nothing more than a financing and capital structure decision. In our case, this transaction benefits our capital structure in a few different ways. First and foremost, it provides long-term capital to grow our business. In this case, capital to deploy adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor in the construction of additional parking and complementary non-gaming amenities that will drive Encore Boston Harbor to even higher levels of performance and capital to deploy an attractive greenfield projects like our development in the UAE, which I will discuss in a moment.\nSecond, it enables us to potentially retire near-term debt with a higher cost of capital than the lease. I would note here that this sale-leaseback transaction was executed at 17x rent or a 5.9% cap rate, a record for regional gaming assets by some 2 turns and an attractive long-term cost of capital.\nThird, it brings a new partner into our capital structure. Sumit and the team at Realty Income have been great partners in executing this transaction. And I would note that there are a number of highly bespoke terms in the lease that reflect our longer-term goals. These terms were only achievable due to the unique way that Realty Income is structured and their willingness to engage and align this transaction with our goals. Overall, this transaction gives us a lot of additional financial flexibility. The transaction will close near the end of the year.\nSome of you may ask, what about Wynn Las Vegas? In response to that, I would note a few important points. First, Las Vegas is a very different market when compared to regional markets. Potential operational deleveraging in an economic downturn is more extreme as we saw in 2009. And the need for continuous and sizable reinvestment in order to stay relevant is high.\nAs many of you know, it is fundamental to us that we maintain consistent service levels and CapEx throughout the business cycle. And I never want us to be in a position where in the midst of a downturn, we have to choose between our world-class service and escrowing rent or between paying rent and investing in our property.\nIn fact, our 2021 results speak to the power of our proprietor's mindset. With a host of new investments bearing fruit and with our team intact despite COVID, we continue to take market share and delivered the property's highest-ever annual EBITDA.\nFurther, the breakage costs related to a sale leaseback of Wynn Las Vegas would be a significant. Beyond the tax leakage, our capital structure in the U.S. has bond financing at both Wynn Las Vegas and a holding company above it.\nA sale of our Las Vegas real estate would trigger an acceleration of that debt, driving over $600 million in breakage. For now, we believe we will deliver far more long-term shareholder value by continuing to own our real estate in Las Vegas, and I am confident our equity valuation will continue to reflect that.\nLet's turn to our announcement regarding an integrated resort development in the UAE. We're thrilled about this project, which will further diversify our business, while extending our brand into the Middle East and Europe. I'm sure all of you are familiar with the UAE and with Dubai in particular. It's a dynamic country and we are proud to have the opportunity to deliver our exceptional hospitality there.\nRas Al Khaimah is about 45 minutes north of the Dubai Airport via a first-class multilane highway. The location on Marjan Island is stunning and will be a great setting for our resort. I do want to provide some clarity on a topic I have seen in a number of analyst notes and media reports regarding the project.\nIn any new jurisdiction, there are 3 things that need to happen to have an integrated resort with gaming. The first is enabling legislation, is gaming legal? The second is, regulation, how will gaming be conducted? The third is, licensure, who can operate a gaming establishment?\nWith respect to this project, no further enabling legislation is required. We're not looking at a multiyear process for legalization like we have seen in some other markets. Regulations are well advanced, having been modeled on those of Singapore and the United States. The tax rate and license structure are very reasonable. And finally, with the regulatory framework taking shape and a regulator in place, we will be licensed to conduct gaming in Ras Al Khaimah. In other words, where we go with these projects.\nWe're commencing master planning now and will begin mobilizing architecture and design in due course. I expect our ultimate design will be one or more iconic buildings that both take advantage of the pristine beach location and also show respect for the unique cultural aspects of the region. We're big believers in the potential for Ras Al Khaimah to be an amazing tourism and hospitality destination.\nLastly, I would point out that this is the first transaction where Wynn Resorts is being paid for its know-how and service excellence via a management agreement. I expect it to provide a very high return on invested capital. We have a lot happening around here, and I'm personally very excited about the future.\nTurning to the fourth quarter and starting in Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas had an absolute stunner of the quarter. $186 million of EBITDA despite holding a bit low. Drop was strong, handle was strong, RevPAR was strong, I could go on and on. To us, the quarter's results are a further indication of the fact that our unrelenting focus on service and great product are resonating with premium customers who after being cooped up for 2020 and the first part of 2021 are traveling and spending again with a vengeance.\nAs you've heard from some of our peers, January results in Las Vegas were impacted by Omicron, particularly in the group side. Encouragingly, forward bookings in January were very strong and February to date has accelerated further positioning us well into March and beyond.\nTo give you some context, our hotel occupancy in January was 61%. And with the latest wave of COVID quickly receiving, we expect occupancy to increase to the mid-80s in March. As we increasingly distance ourselves from our competitors, we believe we have strong pricing power on rooms, food and beverage and nightlife during 2022.\nIn Macau, the market continued to experience subdued visitation during the fourth quarter, and our results reflected that in roll, in drop and volatility of hold. Of course, you need to only look at Chinese New Year to remind yourself of the power of that market and the pent-up demand for visitation.\nDuring the holiday period, turnover per day in our direct program was up nearly 175% from 2021 and down only 12% from Chinese New Year 2019. Encouragingly, we are seeing both strong spend per customer and significant new customer sign-ups in our direct business, highlighting the strength of our market-leading product and service offering.\nOn the mass side, table drop was up 34% versus 2021, and that drop was 60% of our Chinese New Year 2019 levels. As we have seen before, when Macau is more accessible, demand snaps right back. Long term, I remain incredibly enthusiastic about the prospects for Macau. Between the shift to higher-margin premium mass customers and to customers who have more motivations to visit than just gaming, the market is evolving, and we are prepared to adapt and grow our business as we embrace those changes.\nFurther, the concession process continues in a methodical and logical manner with the amended gaming law currently sitting with the Assembly Committee. We continue to be pleased with the process and with the content of the amended law.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had an unbelievable quarter in both gaming volumes and RevPAR, resulting in $68 million of EBITDA in Q4. The team in Boston has really done a tremendous job, particularly in the casino, but we're just getting started. Our next phase of growth in Boston will be driven by database growth, particularly growth outside of adjacent areas and through our upcoming expansion project across the street from the property. That expansion will see us add additional amenities and importantly, additional parking. Parking, particularly on weekends, remains a constraint for us. Though Encore is now run rating higher EBITDA than a number of strip properties, Encore still has a tremendous amount of growth ahead of it.\nLastly, on Wynn Interactive, we generated about $785 million in turnover across casino and sports betting in Q4, which drove a 29% sequential increase in revenue. This was despite a meaningful curtailment in marketing spend in November and December. As you may recall on our Q3 call, we were very explicit about our view on the unsustainable nature of the current competitive environment in sports betting and we stated our intention to manage the business with a long-term shareholder-friendly view.\nTo that end, we began shifting our user acquisition mix in early November, focusing only on proven performance marketing channels where we know we can achieve positive ROI on spend, particularly in casino. By doing this, we meaningfully reduced our overall burn rate and as our remaining brand advertising commitments tailed off with the Super Bowl, I expect EBITDA burn levels to reduce even more drastically.\nOverall, we estimate Q1 2022 burn should be down some 60% from Q3 '21 to the $40 million range, and I expect Q2 2022 to be even lower.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Vince to run through some additional details on the quarter. Vince?\n\nVincent Zahn\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a record $186.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $493.9 million of operating revenue during the quarter we estimate low table hold negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in the quarter. Overall, our hotel occupancy reached 86% in the quarter, with 91% occupancy on weekends.\nImportantly, we have stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience, with our overall ADR reaching $441 during 4Q '21, 37% above 4Q '19 levels.\nOur other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across F&B and retail, which were also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our 4Q '21 slot handle was 40% above 4Q '19 levels, and our table drop was 41% above 4Q '19 levels despite still suppressed international play due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 37.7% in the quarter or approximately 39% when adjusted for low table hold. This was unchanged sequentially and up 1,350 basis points compared to 4Q '19 on a hold-adjusted basis.\nOpEx per day was $3.18 million in 4Q '21, approximately $145,000 per day above 4Q '19 levels due to a combination of higher cost of goods on materially higher nongaming revenue along with special event costs, including the Koepka-DeChambeau Golf match, among others. We remain committed to maintaining a cost structure that appropriately balances margin and our exacting service standards in Las Vegas.\nIn Boston, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $68.2 million in 4Q '21, with an EBITDA margin of 33.4%. We saw broad-based strength across the casino combined with solid hotel performance, which was aided by a favorable calendar set up during the quarter.\nAs Craig noted, regarding in Las Vegas and consistent with some of our regional peers, Omicron along with bad weather temporarily disrupted our performance at EBH in January. Encouragingly, we have already seen signs of improvement in the business as case counts have decreased across the region.\nAt EBH, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1 million in 4Q '21, excluding a $2 million nonrecurring accrual reversal. This was a decrease of over 20% compared to $1.3 million per day in 4Q '19 and a modest increase relative to $950,000 per day in 3Q '21, with the sequential increase driven by improved business volumes and increased operating hours, most notably from the hotel opening of full 7 days per week beginning on September 1.\nLooking ahead, we expect OpEx to increase modestly due to higher payroll, stemming from onetime contractual labor agreements coming into effect in 2022, which will add around $45,000 per day to our OpEx days. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow top line over time in Boston.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDA loss of $25.9 million in the quarter on $325.7 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA included a onetime bad debt provision that negatively impacted EBITDA by $24 million during the quarter. So we would have been essentially breakeven adjusting for that. While business in 4Q was challenging due to the evolving COVID situation, we remain disciplined on costs.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming taxes and the onetime provision I noted, was approximately $2.2 million per day in the fourth quarter. essentially unchanged sequentially. We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage in Macau as our businesses recover.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. In 4Q, the business generated approximately $785 million in total turnover, a 20% sequential increase relative to 3Q. Top line growth, combined with decreases in marketing spend and other OpEx, drove an improvement in our EBITDA burn rate to $79 million in 4Q '21 versus $104 million in 3Q '21. Since quarter end, we've continued to thoughtfully grow the business with launches in New York and Louisiana, and the initial reception from our customers has been very encouraging.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong, with global cash and revolver availability of $3.6 billion as of 12/31. In Macau, we had approximately $1.7 billion of available liquidity as of 12/31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion at 12/31.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $78 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery.\nWith that, Michelle, we will now open the call to Q&A."

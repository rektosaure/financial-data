At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Emerson's Q4 and Full Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please turn to slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. Before we begin the presentation, I would like to highlight our upcoming 2025 Investor Conference on 20 November 2025. We are looking forward to presenting on our transformed company, a global automation leader set to deliver a differentiated value creation framework.\nWe will discuss the drivers of our 4% to 7% organic growth framework, detail our plans for additional margin expansion, and outline our capital allocation priorities. Additional information about this event is now available on our website. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. 2025 marked the 135th anniversary of our company. The Emerson Electric Manufacturing Company was established in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1890. The development of a reliable electric motor was the vision of two Scotland-born brothers, Charles and Alexander Meston, made possible by the financial backing of John Wesley Emerson, a former Union Army officer, judge, and lawyer. Throughout nearly a century and a half of economic cycles, the Great Depression, two world wars, significant technology innovations, and a handful of iconic industrial leaders who navigated uncertain waters, our company completed 2025 stronger than ever.\nWe have transformed. We have momentum in our markets. We have great people, and we are optimistic about our future. Thank you to the 70,000 Emerson employees around the world, to our management team, our board of directors, and our investors for your trust. I am honored to work alongside each and every one of you in our value creation journey. Please turn to slide three. Emerson continues to see resilient demand as customers invest in automation technologies to drive digital transformation and enhance efficiency, reliability, and safety in their operations.\nUnderlying orders grew 6% in Q4, driven by sustained demand in our growth verticals and accelerating orders growth in test and measurement, up 27% and exceeding our expectations. We had a robust finish to the quarter, and I will discuss more details on demand on the next slide. 2025 was another solid year for Emerson. Underlying sales in Q4 were up 4%. Execution was strong in the quarter, with adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.5%, up 1.3 points. We delivered $1.62 adjusted earnings per share in the quarter at the top end of our guide.\nFor the full year, underlying sales grew 3%, slightly below expectations as Europe and China book-to-ship were softer than initially expected. Emerson delivered strong profitability with adjusted earnings per share of $6, up 9%, and free cash flow of $3.24 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Annual contract value of our software grew 10% year-over-year and ended the year at $1.56 billion. For fiscal 2026, we are guiding sales growth of 5.5% with underlying sales growth of approximately 4%, supported by sustained investment in our growth verticals and robust performance in test and measurement. We expect to deliver adjusted segment EBITDA margin of approximately 28% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.55, reflecting strong operational execution. ACV is projected to grow 10% plus as customers further invest to advance their digital transformation ambitions.\nWe plan to return approximately $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases, and $1.2 billion in dividends, including a 5% dividend per share increase. Please turn to slide four. Emerson delivered 6% underlying orders growth in the Q4, marking our third consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth. This reflects sustained momentum across key geographies, and we are seeing broad-based strength in North America, India, and the Middle East and Africa. However, demand in Europe and China continues to be soft. MRO spend across our $155 billion installed base remains resilient, supporting a healthy pace of business led by strength in North America. The capital cycle remains constructive, and large project bookings in power, LNG, life sciences, and aerospace and defense contributed to a better-than-expected finish to September.\nMomentum in power continues to build, and orders in our Ovation business were up 18% in the quarter and 30% in the year, driven by greenfield projects and modernizations. Test and measurement orders were up 27% in the Q4, with robust growth in all regions led by semiconductor, aerospace, and defense, and the broad-based portfolio business. Please turn to slide five. Emerson continues to see success in our growth platforms. Our technology leadership and ability to deliver differentiated solutions are enabling us to capture large-scale opportunities and drive sustainable growth. I'd like to highlight a few key wins from the quarter that supported our 6% orders growth. First, I will highlight two projects in power demonstrating strong adoption of our Ovation 4.0 distributed control system. In August, we talked about Ovation winning two greenfield combined-cycle plants with Entergy.\nOvation 4.0 has now been selected by Entergy to automate three more power generation facilities. Entergy today provides electricity to 3 million customers, and the five facilities will provide approximately 3.1 gigawatts of generation capacity. In another win, Ovation 4.0 was chosen to replace the existing excitation system at the Doel nuclear power station in Belgium, unifying the control systems across the site. Doel provides around 15% of the country's electricity, and Emerson will help ensure the delivery of safe and clean baseload power. Next, Emerson is excited to announce its support to Bechtel Energy and Woodside Energy in the automation of the Woodside Louisiana LNG project. The liquefaction and export terminal in Calcasieu Parish is a premier LNG project designed for safe, reliable, and efficient operations, delivering LNG to global markets.\nThis development can produce 16.5 million tons per annum, with a permitted expansion capacity of up to 27.6 million tons per annum. Emerson is proud to be chosen as a key automation partner for Bechtel Energy. Last, Emerson was selected as the automation provider for three manufacturing facilities being built in Indianapolis by a large US-based life science customer, a major step forward in their nearshoring initiatives and in advancing innovation and efficiency. Emerson will provide our leading DeltaV Control Systems and Software portfolio to enable reliable, scalable, and data-driven automation. Through this collaboration, Emerson will deploy state-of-the-art DeltaV technologies designed to accelerate the time to market of next-generation weight management drugs, enhance production performance, and ensure regulatory compliance.\nThese wins reinforce our position as a global automation leader and demonstrate the strength of our portfolio in addressing the challenges our customers face today. Our continued success is driven in part by our industry-leading innovation, and we are consistently investing to advance our technology, including investing 8% of sales in 2025. In the Q4, we launched two AI-powered applications to unlock productivity and workflow automation. First, we launched Guardian Virtual Advisor to enhance our DeltaV lifecycle management software. This solution combines Emerson's deep domain expertise and decades of data with conversational AI to help customers quickly resolve issues, optimize system performance, and reduce downtime.\nCurrently available for DeltaV, we are innovating it to expand across Emerson's automation platforms to support smarter decisions and operational excellence across the plant lifecycle. We also introduced AspenTech Subsurface Intelligence, a cloud-native AI-powered platform that accelerates decision-making for seismic interpretation. This AI platform automates workflows and improves collaboration across disciplines to help customers optimize production and reduce operational silos. Please turn to slide six.\nEmerson executed well in a fluid macroeconomic environment and continues to deliver excellent operational performance. Growth reflected sustained momentum in North America, India, and the Middle East and Africa, offset by persistent softness in Europe and China. LNG, power, and life sciences continue to attract significant investment globally, and collectively we're up 11% year-over-year. Sales and test and measurement accelerated sharply as we exited the year, up 12% in the Q4 with broad-based strength. Our test and measurement business continues to gain market share, driven by innovation and channel optimization. MRO for the company represented 65% of sales. Emerson achieved annual records for both gross profit margin of 52.8% and adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.6%.\nMargin expansion was driven by strong price cost, higher mix of software, and the benefit of cost reductions in synergy realization, offsetting a 20 basis point impact on gross profit from tariffs. We made meaningful progress integrating AspenTech, realizing $50 million of synergies in 2025, and now plan to achieve $100 million in run rate synergies by the end of 2026, two years ahead of plan. Earlier this year, we completed all the actions to achieve our commitment of $200 million of run rate synergies for test and measurement. Adjusted earnings per share of $6 was consistent with our guidance. Finally, we generated $3.24 billion in free cash flow, exceeding our August guidance of $3.2 billion and in line with our initial guidance as we offset approximately $200 million of acquisition-related headwinds.\nOur 2025 performance underscores our commitment to operating results and positions us well to continue investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders. Emerson's alignment with secular trends, leading technology, and improving orders momentum reinforce our confidence in our 2026 plans. I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman to discuss our 2025 results in more detail and expectations for 2026.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everybody. Please turn to slide seven for a more in-depth look at our 2025 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 3%. Growth was led by software and control, which grew 5%, and intelligent devices grew 2%. Our process and hybrid businesses were up 4% and were resilient throughout 2025. Our discrete businesses finished the year up slightly at 1%, with lingering weakness in automotive and factory automation. While our discrete businesses accelerated through the year, year-over-year volume was down and represented about a one-point headwind to Emerson's sales growth.\nPricing contributed two and a half points to growth as expected. Underlying growth was 5% in the Americas, and 3% in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, while Europe was down 2%. Our backlog ended the year at $7.4 billion. Backlog was up 3% year-over-year due to second-half orders growth of 5%, which positions us well for 2026. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.6% exceeded expectations and was up 160 basis points year-over-year.\n50 basis points of this expansion was due to a favorable software contract renewal year in 2025, and the remaining 110 basis points of improvement came from positive price-cost, the benefit of cost reductions, and synergies from the Test and Measurement and AspenTech acquisitions, which more than offset inflation and tariffs. Adjusted EPS came in at $6, a 9% increase year-over-year, and I will provide more details on the next slide. 2025 free cash flow exceeded our expectations. The free cash flow growth was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital efficiency, which helped offset approximately $200 million of transaction-related costs. Our 2025 free cash flow margin was 18%, up 140 basis points from the prior year.\nOverall, these results underscore the strength of our portfolio, the resilience of our end markets, and our ability to execute in a dynamic macro environment. Please turn to slide eight, where I will bridge 2025 adjusted EPS from the prior year. Operations delivered $0.62 of incremental EPS in 2025, which included a $0.15 benefit from higher software renewals in the year. Excluding this benefit, solid execution from operations contributed $0.47, reflecting continued margin expansion, segment mix, and synergy realization from test and measurement in AspenTech. Non-operating items were a $0.11 headwind due primarily to pension of $0.09 and stock-based compensation of $0.02. Please turn to slide nine, where I will discuss our 2026 sales outlook by region. The resilient demand environment we are seeing informs our view for 2026 underlying sales.\nThe Americas, India, and the Middle East and Africa are expected to remain strong drivers of growth in 2026, with muted demand in Europe and China. The Middle East and Africa is planned to grow high single digits, supported by a healthy capital cycle and significant greenfield investments. The Americas are projected to be up mid-single digits, driven by sustained strength in our growth verticals and MRO. Asia is forecasted to be up low single digits, led by robust growth in India and momentum in Southeast Asia and Japan, offsetting a flat China. Europe is expected to be flat year-over-year. We expect growth to come from the trends that are benefiting the power, LNG, life sciences, semiconductor, and aerospace and defense markets, which comprise approximately $6 billion of our $11.1 billion large project funnel.\nPower, including nuclear, is projected to see robust growth as electrification, modernization of the grid, and data center trends drive substantial investment. Energy security and self-reliance, as well as energy transition commitments, are supporting global LNG projects. Life sciences growth is projected to continue across greenfield projects and capacity expansions to meet demand for biologics and GLP-1s. Semiconductor is also expected to perform well in 2026, with expansions in North America driven by nearshoring investments and government incentives. Lastly, aerospace and defense is set to benefit from investments in new space projects and increased government spending commitments.\nPlease turn to slide 10 for an overview of our 2026 guidance. For the full year, we expect sales to be up approximately 5.5%, with underlying sales up approximately 4%, supported by healthy pace of business, meaningful growth in test and measurement, and approximately 2.5 points from price. We project Europe and China to remain weak. The year-over-year growth is also negatively impacted by about a point due to a software contract renewal dynamic, which I will discuss in more detail on the next slide.\nFull-year adjusted segment EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 28%, reflecting strong execution and continued margin expansion. Tax rate is modeled at 21.5% for the full year. We are guiding adjusted earnings per share of $6.35 to 6.55 and free cash flow of $3.5 to 3.6 billion. Turning to the Q1, sales growth is expected to be 4%, with underlying sales growth of 2%. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin is guided to be approximately 27%, and we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.40 in the Q1. Please turn to slide 11 for additional details on 2026 guidance. I would like to take a few minutes to provide further granularity on sales growth and to explain some dynamics affecting margins and EPS growth rates.\nOur test and measurement segment is planned to have high single-digit growth in both the first half and full year, while the control systems and software segment is expected to be down low single digits in the first half due to a $110 million headwind from a lower value of software contracts up for renewal in 2026. This headwind is projected to be $120 million for the full year. The underlying health of our software businesses remains robust, with ACV expected to grow 10% plus in 2026, but having fewer contracts up for renewal adversely affects GAAP revenues. This accounting dynamic does not affect cash flows and reverses through 2027 and 2028 when we expect to see tailwinds from renewals.\nThe intelligent devices business group is projected to grow 3% in the first half and 4% for the full year, with sustained strength in MRO across core verticals. Second-half growth is supported by backlog phasing and the timing of project shipments. Overall, Emerson expects to grow approximately 2% in the first half and 4% for the full year. Excluding the impact of software contract renewals, Emerson's growth rate is approximately 4% in the first half, 6% for the second half, and 5% for the full year. Please turn to slide 12 for additional detail on adjusted segment EBITDA margin and EPS guidance. Our Q1 adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $1.40 reflects strong operational execution despite a softer sales growth quarter and a tough comparison to Q1 2025.\nWe expect EPS contributions from operations of about $0.05 and non-operating items of approximately $0.04, offsetting a $0.07 impact from the software contract renewal dynamic just discussed. As a reminder, Q1 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.38 included the benefit of several dynamics such as discretionary cost containment and favorable project closeouts in control systems and software. It's also important to note that lower volume from renewals impacts Emerson's adjusted segment EBITDA margin by approximately 80 basis points in the quarter. For the full year, the renewal dynamic reduces adjusted EPS by approximately $0.15 and adjusted segment EBITDA margin by approximately 40 basis points. Operations is expected to generate about $0.50 of incremental EPS in 2026, with approximately 80 basis points of margin expansion from positive price cost and the continued benefit of synergy realization from AspenTech and test and measurement.\nPlease turn to slide 13 for a few comments on cash flow and capital allocation in 2026. As mentioned earlier, we are expecting free cash flow of $3.5 to 3.6 billion in 2026, representing approximately 10% growth, which will come from higher earnings and working capital efficiency. During the portfolio transformation, our capital allocation was weighted towards M&A. Increasing the dividend has been a priority for the last 69 years, but the annual increases to dividend per share were minimal during the transformation. Now that the transformation is complete, in 2026, we plan to raise our full-year dividend per share $0.11 or approximately 5%, which is a significant increase compared to prior years. This raise marks the beginning of our 70th consecutive year of increasing dividends and underscores that long-standing commitment.\nDuring the transformation, we consistently completed base share repurchases of $400 million to 500 million per year. 2023 and 2025 were significantly higher because we allocated a portion of proceeds from divestitures to share repurchase. For 2026, we intend to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchase, which we have planned to be ratable throughout the year. We previously communicated our intention to pay down approximately $1 billion of debt in 2026. That is still the plan and reflects our commitment to maintaining our strong A2A credit ratings. We ended 2025 with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and expect to end 2026 at approximately 2 times. With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. To allow for as many questions as possible, we ask that you each keep to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, maybe just start with some clarification on the software renewal. Is this an accounting change that was impacting the guide here, or is it really the timing of what your contracts are up for renewal? And then related, you called out a benefit in your 2025 bridge of $0.15. Is that related to this, or is that separate? Because you are expecting to recoup this in 2027 and 2028 that you called out.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks. Yeah, I'll start with the second half first, which is to say your understanding is correct. And thanks for the question on this contract renewal issue. It's an important dynamic that I want to make sure everyone understands. So we have a portfolio of multi-year term license contracts that have renewal dates over several years. And each year, there are so many that are up for renewal. And this year, we had more than normal that were up for renewal. And that's what drove the $120 million increase that we're calling out on the bridges. Next year, we revert to something more normal, but it represents about a $120 million headwind in 2026. And it is an accounting dynamic.\nRemember, since these are multi-year term licenses, you recognize multi-years of the revenue at the time that you execute the renewal. That revenue recognition pattern is one reason that the ACV, or the annual contract value, is so important, because ACV has the effect of smoothing out that accounting dynamic. The other important reason to measure ACV is that it more closely approximates the cash that we can expect out of that portfolio in the next 12 months. So as ACV grows, the cash flows grow. You have it right. That is the item that we're talking about. It's not a change in our accounting. It's not a change in the accounting rules. It's just an accounting dynamic that exists in revenue recognition for these multi-year term license contracts.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's really helpful. Just to make sure I heard it correctly, there's no impact on free cash flow. Is that correct?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThat is absolutely correct. And you made another point that I would like to reiterate, which is that this is a dynamic that will reverse in 2027 and 2028 relatively ratably over those two years.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. And then just as a follow-up on the test and measurement, this was above expectations in terms of orders. You called out some of the verticals. Is there anything else in terms of have you really turned the corner here? Because this was an expectation that you would start to see this, and you did highlight some share gains. But just any other color on the dynamics of that business would be helpful.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, Deane, there's a significant momentum certainly across the three categories that I described: semiconductors, aerospace, and defense, which has been relatively robust over the last two years to begin with. And then most encouraging has been the broad-based portfolio business. And that's where the multitude of tens of thousands of customers sit. It touches just about every industry macro that you can name. And seeing that resilience in that business and the return to growth there gives us, and broad-based geography gives us the confidence that momentum continues and that our guide on test and measurement for 2026 is solid.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good morning.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThis is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Just a quick numbers question.\nCan we get the orders growth by process and hybrid, discrete, and safety and productivity in the quarter? And any color that you could give on how Q1 orders are shaping up?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nWell, I think from an orders perspective, process hybrid orders, to your point, I mean, they stayed resilient at mid-single digits, discrete recovered to driven by test and measurement, which exposed in the discrete markets into a high single digit and waits to that 6% orders growth that we reported. S&P orders remained flat to low single digits in the quarter. And we expect good momentum to carry through into the Q1 of this year.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd then in fiscal 2025, excluding this timing dynamic, which I completely understand is driven by ASC 606 and was a long-standing driver of how AspenTech's results were reported. Correct. But excluding that impact, you had core ops of 110 basis points margin expansion in fiscal 2025. You're guiding for 80 basis points in fiscal 2026. It would seem like you have faster revenue growth, less tariff impact, further Aspen synergies. Are there any offsets to consider thinking about for margins in 2026?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo, I don't think so. You've got it right. As we look ahead, we've got the drag of the renewals, that's about 40 basis points. We've got some synergies. And the operations continue to drive about 60 basis points, which is what the operations have been driving for really the last two years, right in that 50 to 60 basis points range. And that's the margin expansion that we consistently talk about, driven by the Emerson management process and what we expect to continue into the future.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nWell, Mike, just digging a little bit more into that first half versus second half organic guide for 2026. The software growth mechanics are what they are, but you also talked about the timing of shipments and how they support the second half growth. Are you expecting any sort of larger project order recovery and/or change, for instance, in process markets to get you there? Or is it really just you have the visibility already in the backlog and pipeline and everything is just talk about the visibility there.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Andy. Ram here. Yes, we absolutely have the visibility. And the momentum that we had in terms of orders in the second half phases that backlog into the second half of 2026. That's point number one. Secondly, if you take out the software renewal dynamic, as Mike explained, the first half growth is 4%. The second half growth is 6% for an overall growth of 5% minus the software renewal dynamic, which is the core growth you've got to look at.\nAnd that sequential growth, second half to first half versus that is about 11%, which is what we executed this year, albeit with a better backlog phasing going into the second half of next year. So we feel relatively comfortable around the second half, first half guide. And the software renewal dynamic is what shows up as the 2% and 6%, but in reality, it's 4% and 6% for a weighted average 5% through the year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that, Ram. And there's obviously a lot of excitement about how our markets. You gave us the DeltaV up almost 20% in orders in Q4, innovation 30% for the year. But maybe you can give us a little more color on what you're expecting for 2026. Obviously, there's particular focus on nuclear. You guys have pretty good share there. Maybe you could remind us of that. And order growth was a little bit lower in Q4 than for the year, but do you expect acceleration in 2026 in that end market?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Andy, while I'm here, no, certainly we're excited about what we're seeing broadly, not just across generating capacity, but transmission distribution investments, which, as you know, impacts our Aspen business. We expect to continue to see investments across combined cycle in the United States, coal and nuclear in China, and nuclear broad-based across Eastern Europe and the UK. I think the underlying dynamics of demand, driven of course by data centers and by the age of the capacity that's in place today, should give us a good, and we project a very good three- to five-year run in this segment of the business at high single digits to low double digits growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Can you hear me okay? Good morning, Steve. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify. So is the Q1 orders should kind of sustain this, I don't know, like the 5% to 6% type of momentum that you saw in the Q4? Is that the messaging?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYes.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. Great. And then just on the bridges, it's a bit hard to parse out the software impact, but I think you have $0.50 of ops for the year, which I think is probably, I don't know, a 45% to 50% kind of core incremental. Am I getting into the right ballpark there? And then in Q1, you only have $0.05. Is there a reason why those incrementals may be a little bit weaker, kind of putting the software impact aside?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I think your leverage expectation is about right when you look at the core that way. When you look at Q1, it's really this dynamic of last year being as strong as it was with that discretionary cost, and some of the project closeouts and EBITDA margin in that quarter, I believe was 28%. And so it's sort of a comparison dynamic.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And Steve, yeah, we leveraged at 265% in Q1 2025, and it just puts us in a, it's just a tough comparison. Not just even if you take out the software renewal dynamic, it's a tough comparison for our base operations, just given the dynamics we just discussed.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThat makes a ton of sense. Thanks for the details always.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the trends in test and measurement and discrete automation. So I think in test and measurement, you're guiding still for high single digit growth later in the year despite the sort of pretty tough comp there. Maybe help us understand the visibility on that business. And then in the discrete world, any updates on some of the different end market trends, please.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Hi, Julian, Lal here. And I'll start on that. I'll have Ram add some color as well. And certainly, we have a high degree of confidence in what we're seeing in three of the four test and measurement markets: aerospace and defense, semiconductor, and then the broad-based portfolio business. However, and this leads over into your discrete question, the automotive business continues to be very weak. We're continuing to see weakness in the packaging, machine-making business, which is very Western Europe dependent: Italy, Germany, and of course, impacted in China and the US as well. So that segment of what has been a traditional discrete market is in the flat to low single digit range. And you've got test and measurement in that higher range that brings up our broad discrete orders. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And you said it. And I think from a geographic cut on the test and measurement side, very, very strong Asia driven by Semicon and portfolio, a very, very strong North America driven by aerospace and defense, semiconductors, and portfolio business. Europe is probably our most muted region because that's where we have a disproportionate exposure to automotive and the EV side. Though the aerospace and defense piece in Europe, as well as the portfolio business, is strong. Then in the core discrete business, as well described, North America is probably the market where we have good low to mid single digit growth in the core discrete business, but Europe and China remain weak in the factory automation and automotive space, as well described.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up question would be around. I know in the past you'd mentioned some of the project funnel was tied to elements such as hydrogen, clean fuels, carbon capture, and so forth. I suppose domestically in the US, the outlook there is worse today because of the subsidy environment changing. I just wondered if that type of activity, if you are seeing push-outs there yourselves, and if it represents much of your backlog or it was just something that was in the prospective funnel and never really came into the orders or backlog more fully.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nWell, Julian, thanks for the question. Nothing impacted in the backlog. These were projects that we've been highlighting as part of our funnel. There's been a significant reduction in the outlook of projects in this category on a forward basis. So we have adjusted our funnel accordingly, but none of it has been impacted in any backlog in the business. So to give you perspective, the funnel that we show today at $1.1 billion has approximately a $1.5 billion reduction in S&D projects. So we've removed a large number of carbon capture and energy management projects. We retained those customer engagements that are still relevant at that point, but that's a very significant reduction in the value of the funnel related to S&D. And that's broad-based across North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nThen just to add to that, Julian, the reason the funnel stays flat is we have seen a significant uptick in power generation, certainly LNG, and then continued build-out of the funnel in aerospace and defense, and certainly life sciences. So overall, the funnel remains flat, but to your question, appropriately adjusted for the slowness and sustainability and decarbonization project, mostly in North America, but some in Europe as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to probably ask a stupid question on the accounting for AspenTech, so please bear with me here. Can you just explain why this is a one-time issue? And just confirm that this is more of a first half 2025 renewal issue comping that as opposed to something this year. So that's my main question. And really just maybe talk about the difference in accounting for renewal versus a new contract and why renewals would have this kind of headwind. Thanks.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Nigel, it's not necessarily a one-time event. It's, again, just how the renewal dates stack up in the portfolio of these multi-year term contracts. And when you go into a particular year, there's going to be a number of contracts that are up for renewal. And whatever that is, it's sort of the revenue opportunity for that year. And we are certainly, in fact, working a bit to smooth that out, but historically, AspenTech was not concerned with the wrinkles that happened because of this accounting dynamic. Again, I want to stress it's nothing new, and it's not a different accounting. It's just the gap that is used on accounting for these contract renewal dynamics.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nAnd Nige, Ram here, just to add to that, now, as you rightly pointed out, this dynamic is largely driven by the software renewals within AspenTech. One of the initiatives we will continue to drive going forward is to manage the renewals dates as we renew these contracts to smooth them out in a fashion where we don't see these dynamics repeat as we move forward. It's certainly going to be a tailwind in 2027 and 2028, given the reset in 2026, but we want to make sure that going beyond 2028, we don't have another year where we see these renewals build up in a favorable fashion to reverse in the next year. So it's an initiative now that we're driving the integration of AspenTech that Vince Cervello and the team at Aspen are driving. But it's a good question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, it was a dumb question, I'm sure. And then just thinking about that in the plan, the acceleration within IT from 3% to 5% first half, second half, you called out some backlog timing. Clearly, with that kind of timing, we're talking here about longer cycle projects. So I'm wondering, are these greenfield projects? And if you can give any details on some of the MOCs just driving the acceleration.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Nigel, Lal here. Again, I'll reiterate a point that Ram and Mike made earlier. It's important to note that adjusted for the renewals, the first half to second half ramp is actually consistent with what we executed in 2025, which is a sequential 11% ramp up. It would be 4% growth in the first half and 6% in the second half of a 5% year. So that renewal dynamic, because it is first half, predominantly first half loaded, really impacts and skews that ramp up on the underlying business. But to your point, we feel great about the backlog situation. We have good visibility in our intelligent device business to execute this plan that we put forward.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nAnd just the projects that you referenced that are loaded into the second half that we want in H2 2025 are in life sciences, in power, in LNG, many examples that Lowe had in his script. But these are the very same projects, primarily power, LNG, and life sciences that will phase into second half of 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Sorry, I dialed in a little bit late, so excuse me if this has been asked. But I wanted to talk about PowerGen, how that funnel is progressing. I imagine there's obviously a lot of electricity demand. Wondering if you could just talk about that and how much visibility you have and kind of at what point does Emerson enter kind of that PowerGen life cycle versus, say, a turbine.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning. Yes, thanks for the question. We are certainly energized by what we see in the power generation, distribution, and transmission markets. Just in context of the funnel and the visibility that we have to the business, we added approximately $1 billion of projects into the $11.1 billion project funnel that is capturing broad-based modernizations and new capacity coming online over the next, let's say, three to four years. The activity is very robust, not just in the United States, but broad-based into Europe and into China in this segment.\nThat's one area of China growth that we did experience in 2025, and we expect that to continue into 2026. And just to give you perspectives, Ovation today controls approximately 30% of all the power generated in the world, over 50% in the United States, over 30% in China, over 30% in Europe. And we have great visibility well ahead because, obviously, we're upstream around turbine and boiler controls to the construction cycle. So we're in those conversations today early with the utilities around the world as they plan out their investments.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up on software. I know you have this renewal dynamic happening, but I guess I just wanted to ask how software annual contract value is trending versus your installed base. How do you expect that to kind of perform going forward? How do we think about attach rate trends there?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Our ACV, we shared the data at one point, finished the year at $1.56 billion, up 10%. We expect that to continue into another double-digit year next year. So very, very solid in terms of adoption of software. And the cash flow trends are trending with ACV with double-digit growth. And we're operating at a rule of 45 when you look at cash flow and ACV growth from a software perspective. So very positive trends and consistent with the long-range plan we laid out when we brought Aspen Tech in.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, good morning, all. Just wanted to come back to the power discussion one more time. So you gave some great examples on the traditional side and talked about nuclear being robust. I know Emerson's valve and instrument content is about 90% of the world's nuclear reactors. Is there any way you can sensitize the content per new reactor or anything you can add on the aftermarket side that you can capture there?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So in a nuclear reactor or a nuclear power plant, I mean, Emerson, typically, if you get the full scope, which is obviously the control system, the instrumentation, and the valves, we get $40 million of content for a complete greenfield nuclear reactor with an opportunity to deliver more than $40 million, 40-plus million dollars over a 10-year annuity from an MRO life cycle services perspective. So that is kind of the scope we operate in nuclear, a lot of valves, instruments, and control systems as part of that automation scope.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nOkay. Great. And then, maybe shifting back to Ovation, you saw the strength in orders this year, greenfield modernizations. Is this predominantly the power vertical driving this, or are you starting to see some sales synergies between Aspen and the legacy Emerson, as you mine that installed base?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, certainly it's a good question. Certainly, as you may recall, in the GGM business, there are absolute synergies between Ovation, which is inside the walls, the generating walls, and the distribution and transmission networks that utilities own throughout the world. So we are managing these on a broad account basis, covering both opportunities because, very honestly, the distribution and transmission network is in a state of upgrade as well. And if you're going to put the generating capacity onto the grid that we're talking about, we certainly see the investments going into the SCADA systems and the software systems to manage those loads within the grid.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nAbsolutely. And I think from a customer perspective, a lot of synergies of the same customers we deal with on the generation side are investing in Monarch to upgrade their transmission and distribution systems. And then from a product perspective, we're developing Ovation, for example, and substation control that extends beyond generation into transmission and distribution and symbiotically works with Monarch to deliver value for our customers.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Buscaglia BNP Paribas\n\nSenior Analyst for US Industrial Technology\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nMorning.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Buscaglia BNP Paribas\n\nSenior Analyst for US Industrial Technology\n\nYeah, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the LNG side of the story. Are you able to quantify what portion of that backlog is LNG? And then do your broader comments around Europe and China weakening impact your view of what's likely to move forward in 2026?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Your first question was, what portion of our $7.4 billion backlog is LNG?\n\nAndrew Buscaglia BNP Paribas\n\nSenior Analyst for US Industrial Technology\n\nI was thinking, yeah, that or the 11 billion you put out there.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nOh, okay. Of the $11 billion, I think LNG is what, about 2? Yeah, $2 billion is LNG. Since you asked of the $7.4 billion of backlog, about $350 million is LNG. And then your second question was dynamics around Europe and China?\n\nAndrew Buscaglia BNP Paribas\n\nSenior Analyst for US Industrial Technology\n\nYes. The kind of weakening of the, yeah.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nAt this point, obviously, when you talk about China, the core business that we do today, chemical, petrochemical refining, is really what's muted. But we're seeing pockets of opportunity. Certainly, power has remained strong. Our export business in China has remained strong. Shipbuilding and marine, which is a unique market for us, has remained strong. And then TNM, which has a decent-sized business in China, has seen strong recovery. So there are pockets of opportunity. I would say we're prudently and conservatively planning for a flat China. I think it's a wild card on China recovery.\nThere is a possibility it could recover into the second half of 2026, but we haven't built that into our plan. Similarly, in Europe, I think that the concerns around sustainability, decarbonization, bulk chemical, automotive, and factory automation remain. We haven't seen a catalyst to indicate that those will turn in Europe. So again, a plan for a flat Europe. But certainly, activity around LNG, which is EPC-driven, in Europe, life sciences, power, and specialty chemical is where we will see the opportunity going forward in aerospace and defense.\n\nAndrew Buscaglia BNP Paribas\n\nSenior Analyst for US Industrial Technology\n\nGot it. Maybe one more on your capital allocation in that pretty robust cash flow. Your stocks are rather cheap, probably relative to what you'd expect heading into the new year. So maybe can you talk about your balance between repo and expectations for M&A?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. We laid out the $1 billion expectation around repo. As far as M&A, that's opportunistic, and there's nothing right now that's in sight that we would say we're going to allocate to. So that's what 2026 looks like.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our time allowed for questions, and we'll conclude our call today. We thank you for your interest and participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining Emerson's Q3 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please turn to slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor Statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking the global Emerson teams for delivering yet another strong quarter. With the support of Emerson's Board of Directors, we are energized by the company we have created with highly differentiated technology, serving a diverse set of industries and customers, and a compelling value creation proposition for investors. Please turn to slide three. In May, we hosted approximately 3,000 attendees from 51 countries at Emerson Exchange, where we showcased how Emerson's accelerating innovation to lead the future of automation. Innovation is integral to Emerson, and three key product developments demonstrate the notable progress we are making to advance our world-class industrial software portfolio. First, we announced a strategic collaboration with TotalEnergies, a significant milestone in realizing Emerson's boundless automation vision with our new enterprise operations platform.\nBuilding on a nearly 30-year relationship, Emerson will deploy our Industrial Data Fabric to continuously collect, store, and contextualize millions of real-time data points from TotalEnergies' facilities, providing secure and unified access to data across the organization. The digital infrastructure, which also includes Emerson's advanced process control solutions, will enable TotalEnergies to optimize operational performance and accelerate AI implementation. This data fabric technology is foundational for Emerson's Enterprise Operations Platform, the industry's first software-defined, OT-ready digital platform that seamlessly integrates and optimizes industrial operations. Next, we released the Ovation AI-enabled Virtual Advisor, which is the first Gen AI advisor integrated into a control system for power generation. The Ovation Virtual Advisor, as part of Ovation 4.0, enables advanced power plant diagnostics using Microsoft Azure OpenAI to increase productivity and operational awareness.\nThis highly differentiated solution is driving strong traction, with over 80% of upcoming modernization projects involving an upgrade to Ovation 4.0. For example, Ovation was selected by Entergy to automate power generation at two greenfield combined-cycle power plants. Entergy today provides electricity to three million customers and is expanding in Texas and Mississippi with two 754-megawatt generation facilities. Emerson was chosen for our leading technology, local presence, and enterprise scalability across multiple sites. Third, Emerson unveiled Nigel AI Advisor in its market-leading test software. This innovation, the company's first step in integrating test-optimized AI technology into its trusted LabVIEW portfolio, will aid engineers in unlocking the full potential of our world-class software tools to address the increasing complexity of tests and measurement across industries like semiconductor, transportation, and electronics.\nNigel can analyze, code, and provide recommendations for improvements when developing and executing tests through plain language prompts, enabling engineers to focus on their own innovation and business goals. Please turn to slide four. Investments in automation continue to drive resilient demand in Emerson's process and hybrid markets as customers seek to modernize and improve their operations. The discrete recovery progressed further, particularly in test and measurement markets. North America, India, and the Middle East and Africa have been strong, and we expect these regions to remain growth drivers with sustained investment across LNG, power, and life sciences. Our industrial software ACV again grew double digits over the prior year and ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. Underlying orders grew 4%, led by test and measurement, up 16%, and with our process and hybrid businesses again up mid-single digits.\nMRO remained strong at 62% of sales, with software and cybersecurity upgrades driving increased activity in long-term service agreements. The dynamic tariff environment persisted, and our exposure was less than expected in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, we decided to ease the scope of surcharges, which meaningfully impacted our Q3 sales growth. Underlying sales growth was 3%, and we delivered excellent profitability. Emerson's adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 met the top end of our guide, and better-than-expected free cash flow generation led to a 21.3% margin. Mike Baughman will provide additional color on the results in a few slides. Our teams are committed to completing a strong 2025, and we are pleased to see the turn in our discrete end markets.\nIn the Q4, we expect underlying sales growth of 5% to 6%, driven by further improvements in test and measurement and sustained growth in our process and hybrid businesses. We project adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27%, higher than previously planned due to the impact of lower tariff exposure, with adjusted EPS of $1.58 to $1.62. As we look forward to fiscal 2026, we expect strong exit rates for underlying orders to support underlying sales within our growth framework. Additionally, we will be hosting an investor conference on 20 November in New York City. We look forward to talking about our transformed portfolio and a differentiated value creation framework. More details will be communicated as we approach the conference. Please turn to slide five. Emerson's demand outlook remains healthy.\nAs expected, underlying orders in our process and hybrid businesses grew mid-single digits in the quarter and are expected to maintain similar growth in the Q4. The secular need for energy security and affordability is leading to significant activity in LNG across the globe, and increasing electricity demand in the Americas and Asia is driving robust activity in power. For example, underlying orders in our Ovation business were up 40% in the quarter, and we expect to end the year up over 20%. We are also seeing strong demand in life sciences, with customers investing in biomedicines and GLP-1 drugs. The capital cycle remains constructive, and we continue to see new investments replenish projects booked from our $11.2 billion funnel. Underlying orders in our discrete businesses were up 6% in the Q4, led by test and measurement, which was up 16%, with robust growth across all world areas.\nThe recovery in these markets is building momentum, and we expect underlying orders growth in test and measurement to approach 20% in the Q4, supporting double-digit order rates in our discrete businesses as we exit the year. Emerson has now posted two consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit underlying orders growth, and July was a strong start to the Q4, with trailing three-month underlying orders growth of 6%. As we exit the year, we expect underlying orders growth between 5% and 7%. Please turn to slide six. Our view for full year 2025 underlying sales remains similar to what we communicated in the May earnings call. Demand trends are favorable and support our Q4 outlook for underlying sales growth to accelerate to 5% to 6%. We expect Q4 underlying sales for our process and hybrid businesses in the mid-single digits, driven by global investment in LNG, power, and life sciences.\nOur discrete businesses are expected to be up double digits in the quarter, reinforced by the recovery in test and measurement, which is expected to be up sharply with growth in the high teens. In the America, we expect broad-based strength in North America MRO and Greenfield projects. We plan to see growth accelerate in Europe, led by energy security and modernization projects coupled with recovery in discrete markets. Robust investment is expected to continue in the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia, and we expect China to be up slightly, supported by power and marine, with improving business fundamentals in test and measurement markets. We continue to see strength in customer adoption of our subscription software and expect double-digit ACV growth for the full year. Notably, ACV in AspenTech's digital grid management grew 26% in the Q3, with strong momentum across North America and Europe.\nPlease turn to slide seven. The tariff environment continues to be dynamic. Emerson's annualized gross incremental tariff impact is now approximately $210 million, which is down from our prior estimate of $455 million given the recent announcements. In the fiscal year, we are now expecting our gross tariff impact to be $130 million versus our prior estimate of $245 million. After our May earnings call, the tariff environment improved as announced tariffs were paused and deals were reached with a number of trade partners. Subsequently, due to the improved tariff environment and in consideration of our customers, we decided to ease a number of the surcharges we had in place. We now expect approximately $150 million of price actions for the fiscal year, which equates to 50 basis points of incremental price. This is a half-point reduction versus our prior guide.\nWe have implemented all the price actions and supply chain mitigations to completely offset the impact of this exposure. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Baughman.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal. Please turn to slide eight, where I will discuss our Q3 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 3%. Growth was led by our resilient process and hybrid businesses, which were up 3.5%, and our discrete businesses collectively turned positive, up 2% year-over-year. Price contributed 2.5 points in the quarter, less than previously expected due to easing some surcharges. Our sales fell short of guidance, driven primarily by this dynamic. Underlying growth was 7% in the Americas and 2% in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, while Europe was down 7%. Software and control grew 2%, and intelligent devices was up 3%. Backlog increased to $7.6 billion, and our book-to-bill for the quarter was one.\nSequentially, backlog was up 2% in both our process, hybrid, and discrete businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.1% met expectations and was negatively impacted by 40 basis points due to tariffs, which primarily affected profitability in intelligent devices. We had strong profit contributions from software and control, including synergy realization at AspenTech and test and measurement. Operating leverage was 25%, and excluding the impact of tariffs, operating leverage was 38%. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.52 grew 6% year-over-year, and I will discuss this in more depth on the next chart. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share of $4.38 is up 9%, with strong operational performance contributing an incremental $0.45. Finally, Emerson generated better-than-expected free cash flow of $970 million, resulting in a margin of 21.3%. The cash flow performance was led by higher earnings and improvements in working capital.\nYear-to-date, free cash flow is up 20% versus the prior year and at a margin of 18%. Please turn to slide nine. Emerson executed well again in Q3. Operations added $0.09 versus the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $1.43. Software and control added $0.06, and intelligent devices added $0.03. The AspenTech buy-in was slightly accretive in the quarter, driven by synergy realization. Non-operating items netted to zero, as share count and other favorability offset a $0.02 headwind from FX and a $0.02 headwind from pension. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 6% year on year to $1.52. Please turn to slide 10 for additional details on our Q4 and full year 2025 guidance.\nWe expect Q4 underlying sales growth of 5% to 6%, supported by meaningful acceleration in test and measurement, sustained healthy pace of business in our process and hybrid businesses, a strong backlog position as we enter the quarter, and expected incremental tariff-related revenue. Adjusted segment EBITDA is expected to be approximately 27%, up 80 basis points over the prior year, with operating leverage of approximately 40%. With this, we expect to land adjusted earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.62, a strong year-over-year growth of 7% to 10%. For the full year, we expect underlying sales to be up approximately 3.5%. Price is now expected to contribute approximately 2.5 points of growth versus three points in the prior guide due to decreased tariff exposure resulting in lower surcharges. We are increasing adjusted segment EBITDA margin guidance to approximately 27.5%, with operating leverage of approximately 70%.\nAdjusted EPS is increased at the midpoint to approximately $6 per share. Free cash flow was also increased to approximately $3.2 billion, resulting in a margin of approximately 18%, which includes $200 million of transaction-related headwinds. With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, you may press star one from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, for our first question. Thank you. And the first question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nPlease proceed with your questions.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGood morning.\nHey, I thought you were going with Jeffrey for the AI advisor. Just kidding. Hey, could we just maybe just sort of touch on the margins again and sort of intelligent devices in particular? So I kind of get the tariff math, but dollar sales were actually up in the quarter sequentially, and dollar profits were down sequentially. So could we just unpack that a little bit? Were you technically behind on price cost relative to tariffs in the quarter and expecting to catch that up in Q4, or maybe there's something going on in mix or else otherwise?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Jeff, thanks for the question. The intelligent devices, you're right, 24.4 and 25 with the adjusted EBITDA margin down about 1.1 points.\nAnd there was a meaningful impact of tariffs, which we expected, but there was also a meaningful impact with FX included in there that really wasn't expected that drove that down. When you take those two out, it's up 20 basis points. The other thing to bear in mind is that the tariffs largely hit that group. There isn't nearly as much tariffs in control systems and software. So that's where you see all of that tariff math reading through for the most part. There's some in the other, but it's primarily there. So the unexpected piece was the FX, which is FX, to be clear, of balance sheet exposures that then get marked to market, and that is in the segment EBITDA margins.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks for clarifying that.\nYeah, I was surprised FX was a headwind on that bridge given you got a translation positive, but the hedge is working through. Understood. And then maybe just on test and measurement, the inflection that you're seeing there, how would you kind of characterize vertical markets that might be driving that? Is it broad-based? Is it concentrated in a few areas? If there's any geographic color to add, be interested in that also.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I'll comment, Jeff, and I'll let Ram add as well. No, we saw very broad-based recovery across all segments and all world areas in test and measurement. I'll suggest that the most encouraging segment recovery has been in the portfolio business, which is the vast array of thousands of customers with a diversified end market basis and gives us the best indication of the recovery in the market.\nBut in addition to that, aerospace defense continued to remain strong as it has been for a number of quarters now, but the recovering semiconductor and, of course, easy comparisons in automotive made it possible to have a positive order number across all four of the segments. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And just to add to that from a world area, a region of the world perspective, Asia being the strongest, they went down first, so they're recovering, rebounding very strong. China has been actually very good in terms of recovery as well, followed by North America and Europe. So I think, as Lal said, every segment and every world area is strongly positive.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThat's great to hear. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nCan you just maybe talk about how you saw the quarter play out? I think you guys said the orders in April were up 7%, and I think you may have exited at a bit of a lower rate. Maybe May was weak and June came back. Just maybe some color on how these orders trended in May and June.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. We felt strongly about that mid-single-digit exit rate that we talked about at the beginning of the quarter. There were some flips and takes as we went through in terms of timing speed, which you always have on some of the orders. You can see some of it slipped into July. Some of it might have been pulled forward on some just large capital bookings. What remained very consistent throughout the quarter was our MRO bookings.\nThere was really no fluctuation there, and that gave us a really good basis. Then we had the capital fluctuations come in and out just based on timing.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Then just as we move into next year from a kind of software perspective, always tough for us to model that, is anything next year with regards to the comps at Aspen or anything like that from a growth perspective that we should keep in mind?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo, I think from an Aspen perspective, certainly ACV continues in terms of high single-digit growth into double digits as some of the synergies come through. So nothing in terms of ACV from an Aspen perspective that is concerning. And then certainly as it relates to our other businesses, the process segment will remain pretty consistent at mid-single digits with recovering discrete.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nLal, just a little bit more on your core process and hybrid markets. I know you expected mid-single-digit order growth. That's what you got. If you look at the business or the end markets, you expect stability or maybe slight improvement moving forward. How do you get that? Is it all from power and LNG? And maybe you could talk about some of the weaker markets, what you're seeing in chemical stabilization there, still getting weaker. How do you look at it?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, certainly LNG, power generation, and life sciences will continue to fuel process and hybrid on a forward basis here given the visibility we currently have. And we feel very positive about the underlying drivers across all three of those.\nChemicals is a mixed story. We actually are doing quite well in specialty chemicals. The bulk chemical story is negatively impacted in Europe and in China, and we just have a demand condition and an overcapacity condition that impacts those end markets. And so those are negative for us. But just about as I look forward into 2026, certainly I expect the momentum to continue as capacity is invested, not just to meet the energy security needs, but also to nationalize, localize manufacturing of drugs, and of course, the enormous expansion we have in generation and transmission distribution capacity.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGotcha. And then just back to test and measurement. I know, Lal, you've been working on sort of the commercialization of growth there.\nSo maybe you can talk about how much of the improvement is the markets as you answered Jeff's question, but maybe just your own self-help and where you are in that process of improving the business. Obviously, you mentioned LabVIEW, and the presentation is outperforming. So maybe you could talk about that as well.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I will, and I'll let Ram jump in here as well. Look, so much work has been done, Andy, as you know, by this team led by Ram and mand they've done an exceptional job resetting this company to address and to be a quick, more nimble responder to market opportunities. So certainly, we have seen market recovery, underlying market recovery, which fuels, but we believe that we're outperforming the market.\nThat is based on not just the reset of the commercial focus in the company, but also in the new products that we're bringing to market. The example I highlighted with LabVIEW is a new generation, new incremental product in the marketplace, and I think that's going to make a big difference across the segments. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah, you said it, Lal. I think the focus on new products, I think, as Lal said, LabVIEW, the software suite, they're launching a new DAC or a data acquisition product, which I think is a core capability that NI and NI customers were expecting. So I think that's going to be a net positive. But also on the commercial side, going back to the basics as it relates to country-specific growth plans, they have great exposure in many, many parts of the world.\nGoing back to the basics and developing go-to-market plans and growth initiatives, simple things, but hugely important as the market recovers, where our management system deployed is helping NI grow faster than the market, and that's clearly evident in the pace of business we're seeing.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey. Hey, good morning, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nI want to talk a little bit about Ovation, if you don't mind, and just maybe some of this is just going to be re-educating us on kind of how you guys make money there. But when you talk about orders up 40%, is this all new projects? Is it a mix of retrofit and new projects?\nHow do you guys kind of think about what goes into a new? Does a retrofit go into a new order example? And then I got to follow up on that too.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, certainly there are a couple of categories there. There's new project, new construction. I highlighted the Entergy combined cycle plants as an example. Those typically have long lead times. You book, you do the engineering work, construction begins, you start driving the automation in. They're an extension of life in plants. We're seeing in combined cycle, coal, and nuclear in the United States and Asia. And then lastly, there are modernizations, whether it's for cybersecurity purposes, AI purposes, or other plants put in new control systems and upgrade their Ovation. All three of those, Scott, as you know, are bookings.\nThey all have different implications to the ship ratio given the time it takes to implement in both. Ram, anything?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. You said it. I think traditionally, the power industry for us has been one of competitive displacement. As you know, greenfield opportunities have really picked up in the recent past, but over the years we've owned this. It was a competitive displacement story. But what is certainly a net positive for us is the greenfield capacity investment in combined cycle happening in the US to fuel the power needs for the data centers. But certainly, markets like China as well. There's a significant level of greenfield activity, and we're capitalizing on that with the technology position we have in Ovation.\nSo all three aspects of the business, greenfield, modernizations, as well as continued MRO and competitive displacement is fueling the order growth, which will convert to sales over the next couple of years.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And are those installs profitable? I mean, is it more of a loss leader and then you make money over time on the subscription, or do you make money on the install as well?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nWe make money on the install. We make more money on the aftermarket. It's the standard formula we've described in the past. I mean, obviously, there's a margin delta between when we win the project, greenfield and modernization, and then ongoing MRO is a very profitable revenue stream.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Helpful. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next questions are from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nCan you talk through control systems and software a little bit? We saw really good organic growth there last quarter, this quarter, more in that kind of little mid-single-digit range. Just talk about kind of what you saw within Aspen and then controls and how you're thinking about that growth into the Q4.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Joe, I'll start this one. Yeah. Remember last quarter, we talked about the total deal pulling into Q2, which would have been in Emerson Q3, their Q4 was traditionally their biggest. So we had that movement, but underlying Aspen ACV growth and continued revenue growth very strong this year. And then the systems business continues to do very well in the mid-single digits and continues to see all the dynamics that Lal and Ram have talked about.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Yeah. I think you said it.\nI think overall, from a full year perspective, mid-single-digit growth plus in the systems and software business. But as Mike described, the lumpiness associated with how Aspen recognizes ASC 606 with the Total, for example, as well as project lumpiness and how we execute within systems and software, we'll have variations from one quarter to the next. But overall, we feel very, very good about the high end of the four to seven range for underlying growth in our systems and software business.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And then just a little bit more color on the discrete side of the business and kind of contrasting test and measurement with legacy discrete. You did see order acceleration there in test and measurement. It looks like discrete orders may be pacing more flattish. And so what you're seeing in the different demand trends there and your expectation for kind of legacy discrete recovery?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'll start off, and Ram can add some color. So there are two very important dimensions of the legacy discrete, Joe, that differ from test and measurement. The first is exposure to automotive and packaging businesses, particularly in Western Europe and China. And both of those markets continue to be relatively depressed and challenging. And that certainly dampened the recovery there. Offset, of course, by some of the more traditional broad-based industrials, which have impacted positively, but generally speaking, are much more muted. And you're right, slightly positive as they came out of the quarter, but significantly more muted than the broad-based applications and market exposures that the test and measurement business has.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And I think the outsized market exposure for us in Europe, which has been the slowest market to recover for our traditional discrete business, our factory automation piece, versus test and measurement, points to the disparity in the pace and amplitude of recovery. But as Lal described, I think the automotive segment and then factory automation, as it relates to Europe and China, have more muted recovery than many of the markets in test and measurement.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Yes. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nLal, just a broader question, and good morning to everyone. Just a broader question on your power vertical. You sort of enter the power cycle with sort of very material endowment in terms of market share. The Ovation orders up nicely.\nClearly, the Aspen grid business is doing very well. What do you think is sustainable growth rate going forward? Can it stay elevated for the next, I don't know, 12 to 24 months, given what's happening in the power gen industry broadly?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andrew. I'll comment and if Ram or Mike have something to add. I certainly believe it can based on the visibility we have of opportunity across both markets, generation, and transmission distribution. I think it's sustainable in the high teens kind of range over the next couple of years. As a matter of fact, we'll probably highlight this market when we all get together in New York City in November as a growth factor for the company because the dollar spend that we're seeing, and it's not just a US story, obviously, is very meaningful and impactful.\nAs Ram described, it's been a significant shift for this team, which had been a, as you noted, it's a high participation rate company to begin with, but essentially grew over the last 20 years by driving competitive displacement. Now we've refocused the team really around project pursuit and expansion of market. So we see that momentum. We're very close to our customers because of that very large participation in the business, and we are very optimistic about the next 24 months at high rates of growth. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. To add to that, our customer intimacy in this business is very high. Based on, I mean, Bob Yeager, who runs this business, has great relationships with a lot of the major power companies here in the US.\nAnd certainly, I think their plan for continued investment and capacity expansion in combined cycle, and then certainly the Digital Grid Management space on the T&D side, supports an investment cycle that goes well beyond two years. Now, obviously, you can't call well beyond two years, but certainly for the next two years, we feel that the funnel is very, very strong on both sides, both generation as well as transmission and distribution. And so we expect these types of growth rates to continue.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thanks so much. And then just looking at where we are in the cycle, I think the narrative from a lot of companies back in the spring, early summer, was that tariffs are really impacting the ability of companies to sign off on large projects.\nI think with 65% of US trading partners sort of having some form of agreement with the US, how has the dialogue with your customers changed? Are you getting more visibility? What does the funnel look like? What's the likelihood of large projects actually being released into the calendar year and in early 2026? Thank you.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So, Andrew, Ram here. We haven't, from our perspective, certainly in LNG, power, life sciences, which is the majority of our project funnel that we continue to drive, we have seen no slowdown in decision-making or approvals to move projects forward. So I think that's the most important data point. Now, certainly in terms of some of the sustainability projects in our funnel, and that's not necessarily tariff-related, we have seen some project cancellations that have impacted the overall size of our funnel, but not in a meaningful fashion.\nBut the most important thing is where we see the growth in LNG, power, lif sciences, and certainly even in the US, chemical, petrochemical projects, and all of the activity in the Middle East, no slowdown. We continue to yield $350 to 400 million of projects within a quarter from our $11.2 billion funnel that has been consistent with what we've experienced in the last several quarters.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. And for the bot in the app, this is not the chatbot. This is the real person.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Nigel, we honored you with that.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThere you go. It's great. I hope it's got a British accent. Okay. So look, I think that when we... You've talked about the order push-outs.\nSo I just thought maybe we could just double-click into sort of the second half order rates. It looks to be mid-singles. I think you were pointing to high single-digit order rates in the second half of the year. So just wondering if you maybe just double-click into where you've seen some of the push-outs. I'm guessing some of the energy transition projects have either canceled or pushed out. And then maybe talk about the North American greenfields. Clearly, power and some of the other verticals you talked about. But I'm wondering, are we starting to see some of these reshoring announcements bearing fruit in terms of orders?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So first of all, I did not talk about order push-outs, Nigel. That was not one of the elements that we experienced in the quarter. There were dynamics around timing of bookings. Some came earlier in the quarter.\nSome came in July. But we didn't see any dimension of push-outs on bookings on capital. And as I mentioned in a prior comment, the MRO activity and booking pace on MRO, which is, as you know, 62% of the business, was very steady throughout the quarter. Ram, any comment? Why don't you comment on the greenfields?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I think the greenfields, which is LNG greenfields, power greenfield, life sciences greenfield, and even activity in chemical, ethylene, and methanol, continue to be positive for us in North America. So no push-outs, no slowdowns there. I think you may have picked up on the point. In terms of our funnel, we've seen some moves in sustainability and decarbonization projects in the funnel, but these are not in-the-quarter or near-term type projects. So that was maybe the commentary you picked up.\nBut in terms of greenfield activity, we stay very, very positive on the movement of these projects in North America.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Sorry about that. The chatbot gave me the wrong information there, so. And then moving on to the discrete automation, the discrete test measurement outlook. Clearly, we're hitting some really deeply favorable comps here. So we've got a mathematical uplift on comps. But are we seeing a genuine increase in investment from your customers? That's the first part of my second question. And just maybe just touch on this FX pinch to margins. Do you think that's going to be a factor in Q4 as well?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nI'll take the second part of that, Nigel. We are not planning for the FX pinch on margins in the Q4.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah.\nIn terms of the discrete markets, I mean, for us, obviously, the test and measurement growth rates certainly drove a majority of the discrete recovery in terms of momentum. Certainly, many markets within test and measurement is an inflection. For example, our largest single market is aerospace and defense. And that will see, as per the recent announcement, continued momentum in spending across the globe, certainly in Europe and North America where we have the best presence. So certainly, that's an inflection. Semiconductors, both RF and mixed signal, which is where we play. There'll be validation investment, R&D investment, as well as capacity investment. And then the broad-based T&M recovery is more a sign of markets getting more confident about the pace of investments and our distributors and integrators restocking on NI.\nSo yeah, I would say many parts of our discrete market have inflection points and sustained recovery. But certainly, the ones we're watching are factory automation investments out of Germany and China, where we haven't seen sustained inflection yet.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Dean Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDean Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Dean.\n\nDean Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey. When we were at the Emerson Exchange in San Antonio, we saw that demo of Ovation AI. Just remind us, is this still in beta test? Has it been launched? It was interesting, the first application, I guess it's not surprising, is Power Gen. What's the plan for the rollout for other applications?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I noted that on slide three, Dean, that Ovation Virtual Advisor has been launched, and it's integrated in Ovation 4.0.\nSo that's out in the marketplace, and it's off to a very good-looking start already. I gave an example also of Entergy, which is building two combined cycle 754 MW power plants in Mississippi and Texas, and they're using the technology. So there's a really good customer adoption there already on that product that you saw as a demo.\n\nDean Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood to hear. And then in your queue this morning, there's a reference to the One Big Beautiful Bill talking about the accelerated depreciation that you're saying it would not be a meaningful impact for Emerson. Can you just clarify, is that a reference to your own CapEx? And what about customer CapEx? With all this reshoring, there could be some benefit there. Could you just clarify?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYou are correct. That is a reference to ours.\nAnd you are also correct that it certainly could be a benefit to our customers as they think about CapEx. And just to expand on that a little bit, the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill are generally favorable for Emerson, avoiding some downsides that were in the outlook as part of TCJA and changing some rates there that will be modestly helpful as we move forward.\n\nDean Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust wanted to ask about the order outlook for Q4. I think previously it was up high singles. Now we're looking at 5% to 7% growth. Was that driven by a revision in the factory automation outlook? Can you guys just elaborate a bit there?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nLook, the process hybrid has remained very consistent for us in terms of outlook. We are still expecting that to exit in the mid-single digits as we were prior. Discrete recovery has been very, very encouraging as we went through the quarter, and you saw, Nicole. So double-digit exit rate there still expected. And then safety productivity, there's some comps in there, but lower single digits on that one. And so it's a mix of the different things, 5 to 7. I guess it's mid to mid single high. I don't know how you define it, Nicole, but it still falls in that band of expectation that we had.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Understood. Yeah, that's fair. And then just to follow up on the margin outlook for Q4, I think you guys said about 27% EBITDA margins. Usually, margins step down a little bit sequentially in the Q4.\nIs the divergence versus normal seasonality just driven by the moving pieces around tariffs?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I think, for us, in the Q4, if you're talking versus Q3, the fact that we're holding at that 27% clearly is an indication of tariff-related pricing getting more favorable in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We always planned it that way, that we would implement the pricing actions in Q3. We have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to them fully offsetting tariffs, but then we'll get totally green, as we call it, into Q4. And hence, Q4 margins very solid, up 80 basis points year over year and sequentially flat to Q3.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session and also conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.\nWe thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please note, this event is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Emerson's Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please turn to slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor Statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. I'd like to begin by extending my gratitude to Emerson's employees for continuing to deliver differentiated results. I'd also like to thank the Emerson Board of Directors, our customers, and shareholders for the trust you continue to place in us. Further, I'd like to congratulate the Test and Measurement team for an outstanding NI Connect last week, in which we introduced the latest technology to enable successful creation and innovation through open, flexible, and modular platforms. The LabVIEW company is alive and well. Next, I would like to congratulate two individuals, Antonio Pietri, former CEO of AspenTech since 2013, for a successful 29-year career.\nI would also like to congratulate Vincent Servello, who will lead the business as part of Emerson. Lastly, I'm looking forward to Emerson Exchange on May 19 to 22 in San Antonio, Texas. We will showcase our latest innovative solutions across the entire portfolio of Emerson businesses alongside over 2,000 attendees. Please turn to slide three. While Emerson continues to execute exceptionally well, we, like all companies, are operating in a period of unusual volatility and therefore have factored a variety of outcomes into our thinking that inform the outlook I will share with you today. Emerson delivered a strong Q2.\nUnderlying orders growth of 4% exceeded our expectations, and all regions were positive, including China. Demand remains resilient for our process and hybrid businesses, which were up 6%, and our discrete businesses collectively turned positive with test and measurement up 8%. Underlying sales came in at the top of our guide with record margin performance, and adjusted earnings per share exceeded our guidance by $0.06. We will go into more detail on the results in the following slides. We have conviction in our process and hybrid markets and are seeing strong indicators for a meaningful second-half discrete sales recovery. Our long-standing supply chain regionalization strategy and global footprint enable us to quickly respond to a variety of scenarios, including the recent tariffs. From these, we have a gross exposure of $245 million in 2025, which we expect to fully mitigate.\nRam Krishnan will walk through the details in a few slides. Emerson had an excellent first half, and we are confident in our plans for the year. We are guiding underlying sales growth of approximately 4% and raising the midpoint of our Adjusted EPS guide, now expecting between $5.90 to 6.05 per share. Our free cash flow guidance is $3.1 to 3.2 billion, reflecting good performance and costs related to the AspenTech transaction, and we now expect to return $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. We're also marking the completion of the portfolio transformation we began in 2021. On 12 March, we completed the buy-in of AspenTech, which now operates as an independent business unit within our control systems and software segment.\nWe expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to Adjusted EPS in 2025, and we are targeting $100 million of cost synergies by 2028, primarily through the harmonization of corporate costs and G&A, as well as R&D productivity. Integrating AspenTech is a key priority in 2025, and the organization is energized by the future opportunities with Emerson as we accelerate to double-digit ACV growth. Additionally, we have completed the integration of test and measurement and have executed all actions to achieve $200 million run rate cost synergies by the end of 2025. We are thankful for the hard work performed by our teams, and we will continue advancing operational excellence as this business returns to growth.\nFinally, following a strategic review of our safety and productivity business, which began in November, we concluded the best value for our shareholders is to retain the business. Safety and productivity comprises approximately 8% of sales, with market-leading profitability and cash generation. This business is underpinned by demand drivers such as reshoring and domestic manufacturing, and we will continue leveraging the Emerson management system to create meaningful value. Please turn to slide four. Our industrial software businesses continue to perform well, and the total company ACV is up 11% year-over-year with broad-based strength. Demand was better than expected in the quarter, with underlying orders growing 4% year-over-year.\nUnderlying sales were up 2%, with our Process and Hybrid businesses up mid-single digits. Emerson generated record profitability again in the Q2, with gross profit and Adjusted Segment EBITDA margins both matching the prior highs set in the Q1. Gross profit margin of 53.5% was a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year, demonstrating how customers continue to recognize the value of our leading technologies. Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin of 28.0% came in well above expectations and was a 200 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 were up 9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations. Emerson generated strong free cash flow of $738 million, a margin of 17%, up 14% year-over-year.\nMike Baughman will provide additional details on our financials in a few slides. Please turn to slide five. Emerson's trailing three-month underlying orders of 4% highlight the strong demand outlook for our business. Process and Hybrid markets remained healthy in the quarter, with 6% growth, and are expected to maintain mid-single digit growth in both the third and Q4. We continue to see significant capital investment in energy and LNG projects to support global demand, led by the Middle East and Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and the America. Our large project funnel, which provides a three-year outlook of capital activity, sits at $11.4 billion, and we were awarded approximately $375 million of content in the Q2.\nWe are also emerging from a prolonged discrete downturn, and our discrete businesses collectively turned positive in the Q2, with underlying orders exceeding our expectations at 3%.Test and measurement orders were up 8%, with tailwinds forming across the broad-based portfolio business, which traditionally has been a leading indicator. Aerospace and defense continues to perform well, with large project wins in the US, and we believe the favorable macro environment will continue in the second half. While we are seeing sustained positive momentum in industrial and discrete MRO markets, factory automation continues to be a watch area, and we believe demand may be pressured by macro uncertainty in the second half.\nOverall, improving underlying demand fundamentals coupled with easier second-half comps position our discrete businesses for accelerating year-over-year growth in the back half, and we expect to hit double digits as we exit the year. We are watching closely for signs of tariff-induced impacts to demand, but we have not seen any widespread indications. April was a strong start to the Q3, with trailing three-month underlying orders growth of 7%, and we continue to see significant demand for our process and hybrid businesses and recovery in discrete. Energy security, self-reliance, and energy transition commitments are expected to sustain a favorable spend environment in LNG and power, while nearshoring momentum is expected to drive further growth in life sciences.\nStrength in Process and Hybrid markets, combined with a nascent Discrete recovery, reinforces our expectations for mid-single digit growth in the Q3 and for high single digit growth as we exit the year. Please turn to slide six. Favorable demand trends support our view for underlying sales to accelerate in the second half and reinforce our full-year guide of approximately 4% growth. Beginning with Process and Hybrid, we saw growth across all world areas in the first half. First-half growth was led by Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with robust investment in energy and LNG projects offsetting continued weakness in China, specifically bulk chemical. The Americas were up mid-single digits, with solid MRO in North America and broad-based strength in Latin America. Europe saw low single digit growth with continued momentum in energy transition and life sciences.\nWe expect process and hybrid sales growth in the second half to remain in the mid-single digits, driven by sustained global investment in LNG, life sciences, and power. We are planning for gradual improvement in China, aided by easier comps and investment momentum in power and marine. Turning to discrete, underlying sales were down low single digits in the first half, with the most pronounced weakness in Europe and China. The orders recovery in the Q2 and a low base of comparison support our plan for high single digit underlying sales growth in the back half. We expect continued improvement in discrete MRO, as well as test and measurement markets, with regional growth led by the Americas and Asia ex China.\nWe now see a more muted recovery for factory automation and continue to see declines in automotive. These dynamics are expected to prolong weakness in Europe and China, although we expect to see sequential improvement in both regions in the second half. The improving business fundamentals reinforce our expectation for low single digit sales growth for the full year. And lastly, industrial software ended the first half with ACV of $1.5 billion, a growth of 11%, driven by demand for AspenTech's Digital Grid Management, Manufacturing and Supply Chain suites. DeltaV software recorded double-digit growth in subscriptions, and LabVIEW also contributed high single-digit growth.\nFor the full year, we expect double-digit ACV growth led by a strong EPC project backlog across energy and energy transition, with continued adoption for our industrial software across power, life sciences, semiconductor, and aerospace and defense. I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman to provide additional color on our financials.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal. Please turn to slide seven to discuss our Q2 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 2%, led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up approximately 4%. Our discrete businesses continued to show sequential improvement, but were still down approximately 1% year-over-year. Price contributed 1.5 points to growth. Software and control grew 7%, driven by higher software sales, while intelligent devices was flat due to safety and productivity, and discrete automation.\nBacklog increased to $7.5 billion, and our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.04. Sequentially, backlog was up 3%, led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits, while our discrete businesses were up low single digits. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 200 basis points to 28%, matching our record high from Q1 and exceeding our expectations. Margin expansion was driven by favorable price cost, segment mix, and the benefits of cost reductions and synergy realization. Strong profit contributions from test and measurement and control systems and software, which includes AspenTech, accounted for a significant portion of the margin expansion. Operating leverage was 180%.\nAdjusted earnings per share grew 9% to $1.48, up $0.12 year-over-year. I will discuss adjusted EPS in more depth on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow was $738 million, up 14% versus the prior year.This strong performance was led by higher earnings and favorable working capital. Free cash flow margin for the quarter was 17% and was burdened by $130 million of acquisition-related costs. Please turn to slide eight. Q2 was another strong quarter operationally. Bridging from prior year adjusted EPS of $1.36, operations added 14 cents. Excluding AspenTech, software and control added 4 cents, intelligent devices added 3 cents, and a full quarter of AspenTech ownership at 57% added 7 cents. The completion of the AspenTech buy-in benefited the quarter by a net 5 cents.\n7 cents from the incremental 43% ownership from 12 March to the end of the quarter less 2 cents from interest expense for debt taken on to complete the buy-in. AspenTech operations exceeded expectations, including 3 cents due to the timing of a key customer booking in France. This contract is the largest in AspenTech history and previously had been expected to book in Q3. Non-operating items, including FX and pension, were a $0.07 headwind. The $0.05 headwind for FX is primarily due to unfavorable balance sheet translation, with some unfavorable impact on sales early in the quarter. Overall, Adjusted EPS grew 9% year-over-year to $1.48. I will now pass the call to Ram to review our tariff mitigation plans before I finish up with our guidance.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide nine.I want to provide a clear picture of the estimated gross impacts of the current tariff situation, both from tariffs recently implemented on US imports and China's retaliatory tariffs on US exports. On an annualized basis, in 2024, Emerson imported $1.6 billion into the US, representing 19% of our annual cost of goods sold as raw materials and semi-finished products for our manufacturing plants and finished products to our distribution centers. The gross incremental tariff impact on these imports, driven by IEPA, steel, aluminum, and reciprocal tariffs, amounts to $320 million on an annualized basis. Tariff assumptions for US imports are as follows.\nIEPA enacted on 4 February and 4 March are held at 25%. Section 232 on steel and aluminum remain at current levels, and excluding China, reciprocal tariffs are modeled at an average rate of 15% to estimate the annualized impact. As you can see, most of our gross impact is driven by the 125% reciprocal tariff on imports from China, while the Mexico impact is significantly mitigated as 80% of our supply into the US from Mexico qualifies for USMCA exemptions. In 2025, we expect the gross incremental impact on US imports to be $185 million, around 1% of sales. Now, to quantify the tariff impact of US exports into our China operations, we exported $105 million of critical subassemblies and some finished product from the US to China in 2024 on an annualized basis.\nUnder the third round of China's retaliatory tariffs, which went into effect on 10 April 2024, we are now exposed to $135 million of incremental cost on an annualized basis. This assumes no waiver or exemption mechanism, and the country of origin for semiconductor fabrication will be based on the location of fabrication.In 2025, we expect the gross incremental impact to be $60 million, around 0.35% of sales. So, in total, our gross impact in 2025 is expected to be $245 million and $455 million on an annualized basis, which is around 2.5% of sales. We are mitigating these impacts through targeted surcharges and pricing actions, production reconfiguration using our global manufacturing footprint, and additional supply chain regionalization initiatives.\nIn 2025, we're targeting $190 million of incremental price and surcharges in the fiscal year, with another $55 million of operational mitigation benefits from inventory on hand and supply chain actions. These mitigation actions will completely offset the tariff headwinds in the fiscal year, with carryover benefit to completely cover the full annualized impact we will encounter in 2026 under these assumptions. As stated in the February call, we had pricing actions ready to be implemented when the first IEPA tariffs took effect. Pricing actions are underway across all of our businesses, and all increases will be completed inside the quarter, including surcharges to our backlog where applicable. The remainder of our mitigation centers around leveraging our global operational footprint that gives us a lot of flexibility to move production capacity around.\nClearly, our regionalization efforts over the years put us in a strong position to drive these actions with speed and effectiveness. Mike, I will now pass it over to you. Thanks, Ram. Please turn to slide 10, where I will walk through the details of our 2025 guide for sales and Adjusted EPS. As Lal and Ram discussed, the sustained momentum in process and hybrid markets, positive outlook on discrete, strong Q2 operational performance, and ability to navigate tariffs put us in a position to guide underlying sales growth in 2025 of approximately 4%, holding the midpoint of our February guide.We expect the pricing actions we are taking to mitigate tariffs to add an incremental point of price, so we now expect total price of approximately 3% in the year.\nThis is offset by pockets of reduced outlook for demand, including muted expectations in China, a slower recovery in factory automation, and weakened demand in safety and productivity from continued softness in construction markets. We now expect FX to be flat for the year versus the February expectation of one and a half points of unfavorable FX. Turning to EPS, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide and now expect to land the year between $5.90 and $6.05. We have an $0.08 benefit from the outstanding operational performance in Q2, and as Ram outlined, we expect to completely offset the earnings impact of tariffs in 2025.\nThe softer demand dynamics mentioned earlier result in an approximately $0.10 headwind for the year, while the impact of the change in our FX expectation provides approximately $0.05 of upside relative to the February guide. Please turn to slide 11 for additional details on our Q3 and full year 2025 guidance. We expect our process and hybrid businesses to grow mid-single digits for the year, supported by healthy backlog and pace of business. As discussed, discrete orders have turned positive and will benefit from easier sales comps, resulting in a meaningful second-half recovery and low single-digit full-year growth in our discrete businesses.\nAdjusted Segment EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be approximately 27%, up 100 basis points over the prior year, but lower than the first half of the year due to the effect of tariffs and segment mix.Free cash flow guidance is now $3.1 to 3.2 billion as we have rolled in the impact of the AspenTech acquisition. Strong operational performance in H1 helped offset AspenTech transaction-related headwinds of approximately $200 million. Including these headwinds, free cash flow margin is expected to be approximately 17%. For Q3, we expect underlying sales to be up 3.5 to 4.5% and FX to be favorable approximately 1 point.\nOur growth reflects the continued positive environment for our process and hybrid businesses and a return to growth in our discrete businesses. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA margin of approximately 27% and adjusted EPS between $1.48 and $1.52. Please turn to slide 12. Emerson has remained committed to disciplined capital allocation through the portfolio transformation, and we will continue to have four primary capital allocation priorities. The first remains reinvestment in the business to foster organic growth, and Emerson will continue these high-return investments to support our 4% to 7% growth framework. We are in our 69th year of increased dividends per share and expect to distribute $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividend in 2025.\nThe dividend will continue to be a priority. Our A2A credit ratings are also a priority for Emerson and influence how we manage our balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. The decision to retain the S&P business makes debt paydown a priority over the next two years. We have updated our guidance for fiscal 2025 share repurchase to $1.1 billion, which was completed in the first half. As we look beyond 2025, we expect to have available approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the next two years to allocate to share repurchase, and strategic bolt-on M&A. With this plan, we expect to bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA back to approximately 2x by the end of fiscal 2027. With that, we will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please cover your handset before pressing the keys.If any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw it, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. This morning's first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nHi, yes, good morning. Just a question on discrete automation. Clearly, you guys are seeing some momentum, right? You're highlighting test and measurement orders, but at the same time, you're highlighting factory automation, limited recovery. So what exactly is getting better in discrete? What end markets? Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHi, Andrew,\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\ngood morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Good morning. So a couple of things here. First, on test and measurement, the recovery in the test and measurement business has been driven by the portfolio business in aerospace and defense. The portfolio business is a broad-based business with tens of thousands of customers and is a great indicator of industrial activity across the world. We continue to be muted in semiconductor, although recovering, and certainly down on automotive. We saw those same negative trends in automotive across the traditional Emerson discrete business.That's predominantly impacting our China and Germany business, which has a higher exposure to automotive, although we see some of that in the US as well.\nNow, in terms of positives in underlying discrete, we saw some green shoots across a number of industries, some of the packaging industries, MRO markets and applications, which turned positive for us as well in the quarter. So overall, certainly in a different place than we were a quarter ago at +3%, but very encouraged about the turn in test and measurement. We believe that is sustained, as we indicated in our materials, and accelerating as we go through the year.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you. And just a follow-up question. If you look at the pharma announcements out there, right, I think Roche is talking about $50 billion in spend, Novartis $23 billion, J&J $55 billion, Eli Lilly $27 billion. I mean, these are sort of semiconductor-like numbers, and you guys do have a very strong position in this market. Just from your perspective, how much of it is political posturing, and how much of it do you actually see in your discussions with the customers, and when should we start seeing this activity if it is, in fact, real in your orders? Because clearly, one of your strongest global franchises. Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no. No, I think it's very real. I think companies are making serious commitments around reshoring the manufacturing. We've been speaking about life science reshoring, if you recall, Andrew, for a number of years now as one of the underlying drivers in our business. We're seeing real activity. Now, of course, it takes time.\nWe're seeing some early projects come into our funnel, but early days yet.There is tremendous demand for some underlying treatments out there: weight loss, diabetes. There are new cancer drugs coming onto the market, large molecule drugs being introduced. You're going to see that those manufacturing facilities and decisions on where to place those facilities are going to be heavily influenced by the current environment. So we're very excited about that. We're well-positioned and working closely with all of those customers on their plans. Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, Grant, on the numbers. Thank you, sir. Hey, I just wanted to ask on AspenTech and just get a sense now that you've closed the deal. I mean, what can you do?\nWhat do you feel like you can do with the asset now that you fully control the outcome that you really couldn't do before? I'll start off, and I'll hand it off to Ram to give his perspectives as well. Look, first, we're very excited about completing that transaction. We have a great management team that we put in place, which, much like we did at NI, is a combination of Emerson folks and AspenTech folks. So I think we have a team that can execute on a plan, predominantly driven around growth. The opportunity here is to drive ACV into the double-digit range and sustain that over time.\nWe believe the technology is highly differentiated, and we further believe, Scott, as we'll highlight at Emerson Exchange, that to deliver our vision of Boundless Automation and the next generation of distributed control system around enterprise software, the AspenTech and DeltaV Ovation platforms collaboratively coming together is going to be critical.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And Scott, I would say we're obviously, in terms of the accelerated momentum on the commercial engagements that we've already had with AspenTech, we're very encouraged by that, and that should continue both in terms of greenfield pursuits as well as the opportunities we see in end markets like power and life sciences, as well as the installed base of DeltaV and our opportunity to collaborate there to sell more AspenTech software.\nThen certainly on the technology front, as Lal pointed out, our vision of a software-defined automation architecture, this will enable faster execution of many of the roadmaps that we have been working with them on, but now, as a 100% part of Emerson, we will accelerate those roadmaps.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOkay. Guys, I just wanted to clarify on the sequential, the tariff impact. Do you expect to offset by the end of the fiscal year, calendar year? Can you do it faster than that? It wasn't entirely clear to me, but maybe I just missed it. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nWe will completely cover the tariffs by the end of 2025. We'll cover it, obviously, at the exposure in 2025, with the programs having momentum to cover it in 2026 as well, fiscal 2025.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOkay. You mean fiscal. Okay. Good. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, Multi-Industry, and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, Multi-Industry, and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, could you start with the decision to keep safety and productivity? It's got a great reputation, great brands. Did you not get the right multiple for it? Maybe it's not the right environment given the macro to maximize value. But just kind of what was the process, and would this be revisited?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, thanks for the question. Look, we did conduct a very thorough review of the S&P business. Through that review, obviously, the external environment has something to do with it. We ultimately concluded that the best value for the shareholders is to retain the business. And Dean, one of the things that this management team has been very focused on through the transformative transactions is value creation for shareholders in terms of not just the disposals, but certainly on the acquisition side as well. So look, at this point, we feel really good about the opportunities. We do believe the business is well aligned to the macros of re-shoring, and particularly US manufacturing. As you may know, this is entirely a US manufacturing business with manufacturing in Elyria, Ohio, with great technology to address those secular drivers.\nSo look, we will apply the Emerson management system. We see opportunities for value creation within a highly profitable segment, leading margins and cash flow, and we're excited to manage on a go-forward basis.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, Multi-Industry, and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's really helpful. And then, just a second question, you said no definitive signs of slowing, but you also call out pockets of softness in China, factory automation, and construction markets. If you just step back and say, what are the data points that you're basing that on? Is it funnel? Is it kind of any sort of leading indicators that you think that there's the slowing, the depth of it, the duration, and so forth? So for those three pockets of softness, what are the data points that you're basing it on?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYes. I'll break it up into a couple of pieces. China, predominantly, softness is in bulk chemical. We don't see project activity, spend activity to give us confidence in demand in that segment. Having said that, there are other segments in China that are interesting, particularly around power generation and coal and nuclear, and we're benefiting from those investments. We're also seeing nascent growth in China of export EPC business. These are Chinese homegrown EPCs that are now beginning to take their skills and capabilities around the world. So we are participating there. And then lastly, in China, the marine business. Shipbuilding in China has become a very large segment, certainly one that we've been participating in. In terms of factory automation, automotive has a big element to that for us, both in China and in Germany.\nAnd we're looking at, obviously, data around automotive spend, but mostly we see that as reflected in our daily orders and funnel activity in the area.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, Multi-Industry, and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. And the construction?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nOverall construction, outside of China, again, we don't see any underlying concerns here at this point in time. But again, and that's some of that, perhaps, reflected in the recovery in discrete globally. So I don't have any commentary there, Dean.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, Multi-Industry, and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and US Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Thanks, Andy. Lal, can you give us a little more color into the strength of your incrementals in Q2 and how you're thinking about incrementals in the second half? I know you've been talking about good material productivity versus cost, and mix has been positive for you, but is there anything else going on? I assume you're keeping a significant lid on cost. Do you expect temporary costs to come back in the second half? Maybe give us a little more color on what's going on.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Andy, it's Mike. I'll take that one. Yeah. Our leverage for the first half was exceedingly high, about 220%. There were some interesting dynamics there with FX effect on reported sales, so we had a lower growth at the top line. But we continued to drive all of the levers around profitability. We had some very good mix with AspenTech. The TNM synergy is reading through cost controls, as you mentioned, and we talked about last quarter.\nAnd then the hard work that was done last year around restructurings in the second half of the year was reading through in the first half of the year. The second half of the year this year, the leverage will probably look, in fact, a little lower than traditional. And there's a couple of things going on. Mainly, FX flips on us and the tariff impact, where we'll have a lot of sales coming through with no incremental profit, but fully offset, as Ram talked about. And the profitability will be a little bit lower due to the AspenTech timing that we talked about. They had the large sale that booked in Q2 that was modeled in for Q3. So on balance, we're looking at a great year with 60%-ish expected leverage in the full year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and US Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nThanks for that, Mike. And then I want to double-click on Aspen for a second. Maybe just a little more color as it enters your portfolio. I think you were originally expecting Aspen to be neutral EPS for FY25. It's coming in mildly accretive. What exactly is outperforming your expectations? And I know you talked about greater than 10% ACV growth, but maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing in the near to medium term in the business.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'll say a few comments in there, Ram, if you have something to add. So I think there are two predominant elements there, Andy. The first is timing. Obviously, we exceeded in the Q2. The timing does matter in terms of the EPS accretion. The second is our commitment around the opportunities of cost. The management team has pursued that very aggressively off the bat, particularly around G&A and corporate costs. We feel really good that this will contribute positively in the year. So an excellent start for the business. Yeah.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and US Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nYou said it. The pace of business across DGM continues to be robust, and we'll continue to accelerate in terms of momentum. The core AspenTech suites continue to perform very well. So we haven't seen any slowdown in demand. You augment that with the synergy actions that Lal referenced. We feel very good about the contribution AspenTech will make this year and into 2026 and beyond.Appreciate all the color.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning,\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nLal. Can you just talk about maybe what's within process, what's holding up for you guys, and where the strongest growth is, and maybe how the MRO is playing in there with kind of the field device MRO side?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Steve, this is Lal. Yeah. Look, MRO was about 62% of sales in the quarter, so it continues to be robust, which is important. And we watch that very carefully with our programs, as you know. But also the capital funnel continues to be important here. The awards at $375 million are relatively balanced, but the three areas that pick out in hybrid and process are life sciences, power, and LNG. And we have not seen any arrest in the momentum in those markets and continue to be relatively bullish as we go through the remaining of this year into the exit of 2025 and into 2026.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then just lastly, any variability around the end of the quarter, any signs of pre-buy or unusual customer activity? I know you guys are now guiding the second half for pretty decent order growth. Any kind of choppiness that you've seen out there in the last couple of months?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I looked for that really carefully. And I wanted to put the April order number out there to give you some reflection. We did not see any of that across our businesses. As you know, we're not a big stock inventory business across the portfolio, but we have not seen any signs of pre-buys, get ahead of tariffs or surcharges across the business. This has been underlying demand that has continued to accelerate in the segments that we expected and continued resiliency in process and hybrid.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\n\nJoe O’Dea\n\nSenior Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry/Machinery Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you expand on test and measurement a little bit? I think there were at least a couple of data points over the course of the past couple of months that pointed to some push-outs that was more on the production side and the R&D side.Just talk about where you sit on the validation side and end market exposures and why the demand trends for you could be a little bit more insulated from some of the other pressure that's out there.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So in test and measurement, we have four segments equally weighted, 20% to 25% of the sales mix. Two of those segments, aerospace, defense, and portfolio, are seeing very, very strong growth driven by underlying demand fundamentals. Certainly, the portfolio business, which is a broad variety of end markets, 30,000-plus customers, and mostly sold through distributors and integrators, represents the broadest exposure that we have to customers. So a strength in that segment bodes well for the overall recovery in the test and measurement markets overall. Then the aerospace and defense piece is stimulated by focused customer spending at large accounts.\nSo those two markets are very strong. Semiconductors, we are seeing recovery. We expect further recovery into the second half, supported by earnings releases from the likes of TI, for example, that saw robust demand for their analog segment. We play in analog and mixed signal, RF and mixed signal. So we expect that trend to get positive in the second half. The only segment where we haven't seen any signs of a recovery is the automotive piece, which is primarily EV battery testing. That's the one part that we're watching. But certainly, three of the four markets that we play in, we see strong fundamental demand.\n\nJoe O’Dea\n\nSenior Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry/Machinery Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's great color. And then, Lal, just wanted to ask on the portfolio and the comments in the release about portfolio transformation is complete now with Aspen buy-in. As you think about moving forward and capital available for bolt-ons, just how should we think about the sizing of that and thresholds that you think about where the types of deal values that we could see, but a threshold above which you just really wouldn't have an appetite for?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I think it's a, as we talked about in prior quarters, going forward, we're really thinking about bolt-on opportunities across the business. The way we scale those are sub-billion dollars. But again, we have to balance that with the overall capital allocation requirements in the business. We're committed around share repurchase and the dividend, of course. We have the debt paydown issue that Mike described. But with that said, we'll have ample room for those opportunities if they present themselves or they come into the market.\nBut at this point in time, really a focus on running and delivering value with the company we've created, which I think can create the most value through organic growth and investment in the company.\n\nJoe O’Dea\n\nSenior Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry/Machinery Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood to hear. Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc.\n\nKatie Fletcher\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey, good morning. This is Katie Fletcher for Ken. I was just wondering if you could give some more color around slide five. Orders are up about 4% in Q2 and then mid-single digits in Q3 and high single digits in Q4. So how does that translate to the second half? Sales are expected to be softer? Is that just driven more by mix or higher conservatism? Any color on that, please.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, I don't quite understand. So the order acceleration gives us confidence in the second half sales acceleration that we have in the plan, which then delivers an approximately 4% underlying sales growth overall for the year. If you recall, we grew slightly under 2% in the Q1, around 2% now in the Q2. We'll finish at underlying sales of 4% for the year. So it's an acceleration supported by the order ramp that we're seeing.\n\nKatie Fletcher\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc\n\nOkay. And then any color that you can give on the strategic project funnel? Noticed that slide wasn't included in the deck, so any additional details there would be helpful.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I shared that in my opening remarks. It's $11.4 billion in size. We were awarded $375 million of projects in the queue.That's generally consistent with awards over the last few quarters around that $350 to 400 million range. It was broad-based across LNG, power, life sciences, and sustainability recovery organization.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Thank you. That concludes both the question and answer session as well as the call itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. Amy Natason, Enterlines.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO Lal Karsanbhai for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. Today marks the anniversary of my fourth year as CEO of Emerson. I reflect on this time with tremendous admiration and gratitude for what we have accomplished as a team to deliver on our collective vision. Thank you to the Emerson Board of Directors for your trust and support, to the management team for your commitment and energy, and most importantly, to the 70,000 Emerson employees around the world for your dedication and deep care for our customers, our communities, and each other. All of you make me better.\nYesterday, alongside the Emerson Board of Directors, employees, community leaders, local CEOs, and Emerson retirees, we held the grand opening ceremonies for our new global headquarters in St. Louis. It was an exciting day. The modern offices align our work environment with the industrial technology company we created, an environment that fosters innovation, collaboration, and inclusiveness. Thank you to the Emerson leaders who brought our new space to life. I remain as energized as I was on 5 February 2021 about the future of our company. Please turn to slide three.\nWe are excited about our Q1 performance, and the outlook for the year is healthy market fundamentals, and our Emerson management system has positioned us to capitalize on value creation opportunities. Our process and hybrid markets continue to demonstrate stable demand as secular drivers propel continued investment in automation technology to drive efficiency, reliability, and safety. Energy security, nearshoring initiatives, and energy transition commitments are driving sustained spend in LNG, life sciences, power, and metals and mining.\nWe saw sequential orders improvement in our discrete businesses, although the amplitude was a little softer than expected as momentum in industrial, semiconductor, and discrete MRO was offset by muted performances in automotive and factory automation. We are expecting discrete orders to turn slightly positive in Q2, with a more meaningful orders ramp in the second half. We saw robust underlying demand for our software solutions across the portfolio, with 10% growth in ACV, or annual contract value, led by double-digit growth from control systems and software.\nEmerson again executed at a world-class level and demonstrated the profitability of our transformed portfolio, as margin, leverage, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow all exceeded our expectations. Q1 underlying sales were inside the guide, and I'll go into more detail on the next slide. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2025 plans and are energized by the robust operational start to the year and sustained high-level performance. We are pleased to reiterate our guidance for underlying sales, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow, with outstanding execution offsetting the profitability headwinds from the large movements in FX since our initial guide.\nAdditionally, we are increasing our expectations for operating leverage for the year to the 70s from the mid-40s. The growth and profitability of the Emerson portfolio is evident, supported by our exceptional team, world-class technology, and differentiated Emerson management system. Last week, we took a significant step forward in the final phase of our portfolio transformation by reaching an agreement with AspenTech, under which Emerson would acquire all outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock not already owned by Emerson for $265 per share, pursuant to an all-cash tender offer.\nYou can find our comments regarding the AspenTech agreement and pursuant tender process in our 27 January press release, and we will not be commenting further until appropriate. The strategic alternatives process for safety and productivity is still underway, and we will provide an update when appropriate. Now, I want to spend a few moments to talk about tariffs. In 2018, the United States enacted Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, primarily targeting exports from China. At that time, we acted immediately to use price and surcharges to protect profitability, and we also embarked on a program to de-risk our supply chain for raw materials, subassemblies, and finished goods.\nThe impact of those tariffs was de minimis due to our swift actions and ability to capture price. The current tariff situation is fluid, but based on our supply chain regionalization strategy, learnings from prior tariff responses, and planned price actions, we feel very good about our position. Starting with China, we do not expect a material impact based on actions taken since 2018. Next, we expect the impact from Canada to also be de minimis, as we do not have any material exposure there. Last, the situation in Mexico is evolving, and we are prepared for a variety of scenarios.\nWe are ready to implement price and surcharges to protect the P&L commitments of the company, and these assumptions are embedded in our guide. Please turn to slide four. Q1 once again showcased Emerson's ability to consistently execute. Underlying orders were up 1% year-over-year, led by healthy process and hybrid markets, which were up low single digits despite a difficult comp from the prior year, which benefited from the timing of mega project bookings. Orders growth was led by robust demand in the Middle East and strength in the US, both from MRO business and several project awards.\nWe saw exceptional demand growth in our power business, as well as continued strength in energy and energy transition projects globally. Chemical in the Middle East and Americas continues to see strong investment from capacity expansion and modernization efforts. Demand in China remained muted, as strength in power was offset by weakness in chemical and discrete end markets. Underlying sales were up 2%, led by sustained strength in our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits.\nWe saw healthy activity in power and energy markets globally with sustained capital project momentum, as customers are moving to meet the demand for energy security and affordability, as well as increasing electricity demand. Robust project activity in the Middle East offset softness in Asia, and we saw strength in North America MRO and Latin America broadly. MRO also performed well in the quarter, representing 64% of sales. Gross profit margin was a record, 53.5%, reflecting the value of our transformed portfolio.\nWe also delivered record adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 28%, a 340 basis point improvement driven by strong operational performance, including price-cost management, mix, and the benefits of cost reductions and synergy realization. This profit performance, in addition to the impact of FX, drove our operating leverage significantly above our guide. Adjusted Earnings Per Share exceeded expectations, as $1.38 was above the top end of our guide and up 13% year-over-year. Emerson also delivered strong free cash flow of $694 million, a margin of approximately 17%, and up 89% versus Q1 2024.\nAdditionally, Emerson completed approximately $1 billion of share repurchase in the quarter, as guided. Mike Baughman will provide additional color on our financials in a few slides. Please turn to slide five. Emerson's innovation and differentiated product portfolio continues to be recognized by our customers and industry experts, and I'd like to highlight two recent awards recognizing our DeltaV business. In December, Emerson's DeltaV Edge Environment was one of 10 products recognized as a 2024 Processing Breakthrough Product. Processing's annual award honors innovative technology solutions that made significant contributions to increase efficiency, productivity, safety, and profitability in industrial processing operations.\nDeltaV Edge Environment was selected because it is its first of its kind integrated software solution to help customers access and contextualize data to improve enterprise operational performance. It also enables customers to run AI tools on the edge, moving the compute process closer to the intelligent field to make better use of their data. We also recently released DeltaV Edge Environment 2.0, which now supports batch data integration to help life sciences, chemical, and other batch processing industries bridge the gap between OT and IT applications.\nDeltaV Edge Environment 2.0 provides secure, contextualized DCS data to help customers deploy advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning at the edge or in the cloud to make better operational and business decisions. This release is another step forward in our vision to Boundless Automation, as it helps to eliminate data silos and drive competitive advantage. Emerson was also awarded the 2025 IoT Breakthrough Award for Industrial IoT Innovation of the Year for its DeltaV Workflow Management software.\nThis year's program attracted more than 3,850 nominations globally, and the award recognizes Emerson's next-generation software as a service solution to help life sciences companies more efficiently develop, scale, and manufacture life-changing therapies. DeltaV Workflow Management provides a cloud-based solution with simple recipe authoring, execution, and electronic data capture, which helps life sciences customers scale and deliver drugs to market safely, efficiently, and quickly. Emerson has been recognized every year by the IoT Breakthrough Awards since their inception due to our industrial technology portfolio driving innovation across the world's essential industries.\nPlease turn to slide six. We see significant opportunity in front of us for LNG. When we announced LNG as part of our energy transition growth platform in 2022, we expected the current wave to add approximately 250 million tons per annum of operational capacity, predominantly across North America, the Middle East, and Africa. While we are approximately 2/3 through the initial 250 MTPA, we are seeing large incremental opportunities as additional projects are announced to meet the world's growing demand for gas. LNG will continue to play a large role as a transition fuel, and we'll also benefit from a rising demand for power generation.\nAn important milestone in the LNG project timeline is when an EPC is selected because this typically starts the process to award automation, which can take up to a year. In 2024, only 18 MTPA was awarded to EPCs, partly due to the US moratorium on export licenses. The LNG project pipeline continues to see significant growth, and we have solid visibility into a potential 80-plus MTPA per year being awarded to EPCs over the next three years as the moratorium has been lifted and the LNG wave is proving to be larger than we had initially expected. These are large, complex projects in which our differentiated portfolio, global scale, and demonstrated project execution capabilities enable a strong value proposition for customers.\nWe continue to see an opportunity for automation content of approximately $10 million per MTPA of liquefaction across our leading valve, instrument, and control system and software portfolio. We have continued to see a win rate of approximately 50% for the full portfolio and greater than 50% for control systems in large LNG projects, and are seen as a premier automation supplier globally. For example, around 70% of the world's LNG flows through Emerson valves, and we have one control system on six of the last 11 projects awarded.\nGiven the incremental opportunity for projects expected to move forward in our project scope, we see a potential for greater than $1 billion in Emerson orders over the next few years. We were recently awarded one such key win, Cedar LNG, a floating LNG facility in British Columbia. Cedar LNG is a partnership between Pembina and the Haisla Nation and is being executed by a leading EPC, Black & Veatch. Emerson will provide our leading technology from across the automation stack, including valves, instruments, control systems, and optimization software. Emerson was selected through our demonstrated LNG expertise and global reach. Please turn to slide seven.\nAs we communicated last year, power is an area where we have seen strong orders growth as the fundamental opportunities in this sector continue to accelerate. As such, we are now classifying traditional power as a growth platform for Emerson. Power and renewables represented approximately 10% of sales in 2024, and Emerson is poised to capitalize on positive trends across the power landscape as global project investment continues to increase in response to rising electricity demand forecasts and grid complexity. Installed renewable capacity globally is expected to triple by 2030, taxing an aging grid developed for the one-way flow of electrons.\nIt is estimated that over $3 trillion of grid infrastructure investment is required by 2030 to support electrification and renewable energy. Utilities are also making large investments for incremental generating capacity through a mix of greenfield, brownfield, and modernization projects. Emerson has leading solutions across the technology stack to serve customer needs for power generation, transmission, and distribution, including our industry-leading Ovation control systems, control valves, and AspenTech Digital Grid Management software.\nOur Ovation control system technology currently automates around 1.8TW or 20% of the electricity generated globally, including 50% of power generated in the US, and we also have a large install base in power across our instrument and valve portfolio. These projects include many types of generation, and I want to highlight our strength in combined cycle gas plants and nuclear power, including a recent win in nuclear. Ovation automates 18 of the 20 largest combined cycle gas plants in the US, and approximately 100 nuclear reactors globally also use the Ovation technology.\nOur control valves were the first ever to receive ASME certification decades ago for use in nuclear facilities, and have been installed in approximately 90% of the world's nuclear plants. Emerson has the most complete portfolio of nuclear-grade isolation, control, and safety valves and has been serving customers in the nuclear power industry for decades, with nuclear power sales of approximately $325 million last year. Emerson's expertise in intelligent devices for the nuclear power industry was critical to recently winning an award for the Sizewell C project in the UK.\nWithin the project, Framatome will deliver two pressurized water reactors that will generate 300GW of electricity, powering the equivalent of around 6 million homes for 60 years. Emerson will provide valves and instruments and was selected for our innovative technology and long history of high-quality solutions. Please turn to slide eight. We are in a resilient capital cycle with a healthy strategic project funnel, and I'd like to walk through some updates to align with our current portfolio and market opportunities. As discussed on the prior chart, we are now reclassifying our traditional power funnel as a growth platform.\nAdditionally, we have owned Test & Measurement for a year and integrated into our processes, including how we pursue projects and manage the business. While semiconductor has been in a tough cycle, we see it as a driver of future growth supported by macro trends such as nearshoring, advanced packaging, and the ubiquity of chips. We have included the large semiconductor project opportunities currently valued at $300 million, and are classifying it as a growth platform. With this addition, our funnel now is at $11.5 billion. Excluding semiconductor, our funnel is $11.2 billion, consistent with last quarter and up 7% year-over-year.\nMany verticals in the funnel were up double-digit year-over-year, led by life sciences, LNG, sustainability and decarbonization, nuclear, and traditional power. Combined with the approximately $400 million of project awards in the quarter that exited the funnel, this showcases a constructive environment in which customers continue to invest and advance projects. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide nine to discuss our Q1 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 2%, led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up approximately 5%, while our discrete businesses, including safety and productivity, were down approximately 4%. We continue to see strong performance from our growth platforms, which were collectively up mid-single digits, led by industrial software, energy transition, which includes LNG, and life sciences. Investment across greenfield, brownfield, and modernization projects continues at robust levels.\nPrice contributed 1.5 points to growth. Underlying growth was up 4% in Asia and the Middle East and up 3% in the Americas. Europe was down 2%. Software and control grew 4%, while intelligent devices grew 2%. Backlog increased slightly to $7.3 billion. Sequentially and excluding FX, total backlog was up 4%, led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits, while our discrete businesses were up low single digits. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 340 basis points to 28%, a record high. Margin expansion was driven by favorable price and net material inflation, mix, the benefit of cost reductions, and synergy realization.\nOperating leverage of 265% exceeded our guide due to outstanding profit performance and the effect of foreign exchange rates on margins. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $1.38, up $0.16, and is a strong start to the year. I will discuss adjusted EPS in more depth on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow was $694 million, up 89% versus the prior year. This strong performance was driven by higher earnings, improved working capital, and tailwinds from the prior year cash outflow of approximately $100 million for acquisition-related costs and integration activities. Free cash flow margin for the quarter was approximately 17%. Please turn to slide 10.\nWe delivered another exceptional quarter operationally in Q1. Adjusted Earnings Per Share increased $0.16 from the prior year due solely to operations. Software and control led the growth, contributing $0.09, and intelligent devices contributed $0.07. Corporate and other items netted to zero as headwinds from stock comp and pension were offset by an FX tailwind from an unfavorable impact last year. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 13% year-on-year to $1.38. Please turn to slide 11 for details on our Q2 and full year 2025 guidance.\nThe sustained momentum in process and hybrid markets and our strong Q1 operational performance put us in a position to reiterate our full year 2025 guidance for underlying sales, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. Overall, we expect our process and hybrid businesses to grow mid-single digits for the year, supported by backlog and a resilient funnel. We have lowered our full year outlook for our discrete businesses to the low single-digit range. Our discrete businesses have started the year slower than expected, but we expect a meaningful recovery against easier comps in the second half.\nAs Lal mentioned earlier, China demand has been muted, but we are looking to see growth in the second half as we are expecting recovery in chemical and discrete, with power continuing to be strong in the region. We are holding underlying sales at 3% to 5%, but lowered GAAP net sales guidance to 1.5% to 3.5% due to a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $350 million as the US dollar strengthened at the end of Q1. This FX movement unfavorably impacted adjusted EPS approximately $0.08, which we have predominantly offset with our strong Q1 operational performance to hold our prior guidance of $5.85 to 6.05 per share.\nWe are increasing our expectations for 2025 operating leverage to the 70s versus the mid-40s guidance from November due to the operating performance in Q1 and the impact of FX on leverage. We are reiterating our free cash flow guidance of $3.2 to 3.3 billion. For the year, we expect to return approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders through dividends of approximately $1.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, of which we completed approximately $1 billion in the Q1 as planned. In the Q2, we expect underlying sales to be up 1% to 2% and FX to be unfavorable by approximately 1.5 points.\nOur growth reflects tough prior year comps for our process and hybrid businesses, and continued softness in discrete. However, discrete volumes are expected to be up sequentially and better on a year-over-year basis compared to the Q1 year-over-year change. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA margin of approximately 26.5% and adjusted EPS between $1.38 and $1.42. Consistent with November's guide, our current guidance includes safety and productivity and a 57% ownership of AspenTech. We have provided the contribution of safety and productivity as a reference for investors to understand what an exit of this business could look like.\nFor the year, we continue to expect safety and productivity to contribute approximately $0.48 of adjusted EPS and approximately $200 million of free cash flow on flat underlying sales. Regarding AspenTech, we are expecting $0.11 in our Q2 adjusted EPS guide and $0.44 to $0.46 for the year, also the same as communicated in November. Finally, regarding the AspenTech transaction, while the effect of the pending AspenTech transaction is not part of our adjusted EPS guidance today, if we had assumed a successful close in the first half of calendar 2025, the minority buy-in would not have changed our current guidance range of $5.85 to $6.05. And with that, we will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. The first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just, Lal, thanks for the color on the geographic and congrats on the anniversary. I didn't realize today was the day. Could you just be a little more specific on Mexico, maybe the size of your COGS down there, and what parts of your business are most highly exposed?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nOh, good morning, Jeff. Thank you. Good to hear you. No, look, I think we feel very comfortable, obviously, with the understanding of the exposure related to potential tariffs in Mexico. We've done the work with our businesses to assess the required price and surcharge activities that we'd have to put in place, and we're ready to go. But I'm not going to go into the details on COGS, etc.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThen on the discussion on discrete that Mike went through, your commentary on discrete is collectively legacy Emerson Discrete plus Test & Measurement. Is there any distinction to be drawn between what you're expecting for the remainder of the year in those two businesses in terms of their trajectory or other factors?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, that's a correct interpretation. As we referenced the end market, we are referencing those two businesses. The color I gave really applies across both, as we have exposure in all markets, obviously, certainly one or two-weighted one way or the other. Strength in semiconductor in the quarter, which was encouraging to see. Certain elements of MRO were stronger and industrial applications of those products. The offset there we're watching very carefully is broader factory automation and, of course, automotive.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nJust a kind of a question on a little bit of a niche, which is the Forex side. I think it was a headwind on sales, but looks in the earnings bridge on in the slides that it was a benefit to EPS of like $0.04 or something. Can you just explain what's going on there?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Steve, it's Mike. The benefit of $0.04 was largely some transactional FX that was in the prior year that didn't happen in the current year. So we had a number of losses that didn't emerge. Again, that's not the translation of the P&L. That's just translating the non-functional balance sheet pieces. That's the $0.04 that we're referencing.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, great. Then just one follow-up on the incrementals. I mean, super strong core incrementals here. A little bit tough to explain just by operations. Did you guys have raw material deflation this quarter, or is that just a mixed impact? I mean, it was pretty much across the board. So just curious as to maybe a little bit more on the bridge for the process, whether that's deflation or beneficial mix.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Steve, Ram here. Yeah, I think we certainly had positive price, 1.5 points of positive price. We had favorable net material inflation, which is the deflation you referenced. We had strong mix, strong growth in AspenTech at good margins. So the mix was in our favor. So a lot of things went our way in the quarter as it relates to price costs, cost reductions, and favorable mix to drive the incrementals that you saw.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nWell, so project funnel at 11.2x semi was pretty stable, as you said, versus Q4. But obviously, there's a lot of geopolitical and macro noise out there. So maybe just stepping back and opining on the ability of the funnel to continue to grow. I know you highlighted LNG and power. So do they, for instance, now lead growth versus, let's say, clean energy type projects given the new US administration's focus? And then could you comment on your visibility into process and hybrid markets continuing to grow mid-single digits? I know you reiterated that, but confidence level on that?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, thanks, Andy. That's a great question. Certainly, we have not seen any abatement in the commitment of our customers to not just make investments to increase energy security and affordability efforts, but also to decarbonize their operations. They seem to be working hand in hand, and that's based on commitments that have been made to shareholders, employees, and communities. So we're continuing to see that across the world. Further, the investments in power generation seem to be relatively balanced. We certainly think that nuclear will have a, we are in the beginnings of a renaissance on the nuclear space, with not just the extension of life of plants, but the recommissioning of, in the past, mothball facilities.\nThere's three such in the United States that have been publicly announced so far. But in addition to that, combined cycle will play a big role. So gas burning, which ties back to the investments made in the field. But we're continuing to see acceleration as well in hydro, wind, and solar investments. And of course, the promise of hydrogen continues to be out there with significant investments being made in the Middle East and use cases being developed in Korea and Japan for that energy. So watching all of those carefully, we don't really have a sense today or concern about a slowdown in a sustainability funnel, and we would expect that to continue to be robust through the quarter.\nIn terms of process and hybrid, yes, we continue to be optimistic based on what we see in the marketplace, not just driven by the capital, but also by the modernizations and certainly by the MRO. 24% of total revenue in the quarter continues to be a very significant driver of our business and the profitability in the business as well. Ram and I are going to be traveling around. Ram will be in India and Asia. I'll be in the Middle East next week. We'll continue to get a sense with our customers of the investment, but nothing that we've heard to date would give me concern on the strength of the funnel.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nIt's helpful. Maybe a preview of your trip next week. In terms of geography, obviously, you mentioned China is still a little slow. Do you think China grows in 2025? And if it doesn't, can you offset it, for instance, with continued Middle East strength?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThat's exactly right. We were down mid-single digits in China in the quarter. We do expect it to better towards the second half, but growth is something we're going to be watching carefully there. The strength really comes from two world areas: the Americas, being one, driven by North America, and the Middle East and Africa region. That's the press. And then I will say, on a tertiary basis, India and other parts of Asia as well. Ram, anything to add?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, I think on China, certainly the one segment that we're watching very carefully, which is a significant part of our sales mix, is bulk chemicals. But there are pockets of activity in power and export. Certainly, we have a $20 billion installed base in China. We're driving that. But China overall, to your point, I think if we can drive to a flat year in China, I think that's what's baked into a plan. And as well said, the upside for us or where we have to really press hard is North America and the Middle East.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the call, you guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Wanted to spend a little bit more time on the margins. It sounds like price cost was the biggest driver of the margin strength in the quarter, and so maybe just confirmation around that. And then as well, how you think about that dynamic moving forward. Is that easing? And any color on the cost component of it? Is that market-based costs or more Emerson actions?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Joe, it's Mike. On price cost, yes, it was a driver, as it consistently is for us. I would say this quarter, cost reduction was actually a bigger driver. We did a lot of work last year in, as you know, Test & Measurement with the integration and in the Discrete business, measurement and analytical. We did a lot of cost work that's reading through. We also got off to a great start on just discretionary cost control in the Q1. I think we'll see some of that come back in the Q2. And I'm really glad we did that, given what we saw in FX and the FX headwind that we're going to face in the back half. The other thing that we thought that Ram touched on was mix.\nThere's business mix in there. The Aspen contribution in the quarter was significant. They had a very strong quarter, which drove the Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin up quite a bit. Now, again, that impact in Q2 won't be quite as big. And then there was the FX that we touched on, which also drove actually a full point of that 340 basis points in the quarter that we won't see. So it was a combination of all of those things. We'll continue to see cost reductions and price as we do every quarter. And to give you a little more color, those are running ahead of inflation. So it's a credit to the margin.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's great color. And then, well, just wanted to touch on your comment about being in the final phase of portfolio transformation and how we think about that vis-à-vis sort of future M&A appetite. You think about sort of post-portfolio transformation that we enter more of a bolt-on environment, but just overall what the future sort of portfolio priorities are.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe. Yeah, so I'll reiterate what I said, I think, three months ago. This was a very significant transformative effort for the company, a significant amount of M&A activity to put us in the position that we are in now. So on a go-forward basis, our focus will be on disciplined M&A around bolt-ons. We believe there continue to be billion, sub-billion-dollar opportunities to bring technology into the company and expand our customer relevance. But certainly returning cash to our shareholders through the dividends, share repurchase where appropriate, as we committed to, and investing back into our businesses.\nWe have a great portfolio of technology opportunities for organic investment. And that's where the focus will be as we get through this transformation here, which is right in front of us.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Just want to come back to the second half inflection in the Discrete Automation and National Instruments. I mean, easier comps, I get, and that's very clear. But what about any sort of near-term KPIs you're tracking? Obviously, we're seeing some good news on ISM, but are you seeing any kind of orders inflection or book-to-bill above one? Anything to kind of give you confidence that that's actually playing out?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Nigel here, Ram here. First off, we saw sequential orders growth in the discrete business in Q1. So that's a positive sign. Certainly, segments where we're seeing inflection is semis for National Instruments on the Test & Measurement side, and also the broader business, the portfolio business, which is, again, representative of our customers, the broad-based 35,000 customers stocking up in distribution and integrators putting stock back in. So that's a good sign. Certainly, the North America activity in our traditional Discrete Automation business has been promising.\nSo some green shoots, but again, the way the second half recovery for us will work is certainly sequential growth to the first half, which I think is built in at a pretty nominal rate to the plan, but certainly on a year-over-year basis, the second half comparisons, given the second half of last year, will be more promising. And so I think it's a thoughtful plan as it relates to how we expect the markets to come back. And the green shoots have certainly been semiconductors portfolio and North America in our discrete business.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, Ram. That's helpful. Then just switching to the LNG slides. Number one, did the moratorium have any impact in terms of the, I mean, I'm sure it did, but how significant is the lifting of the moratorium on new LNG permits? And then the pipeline, 75% North America, is a stunning number. Does your win rate vary across regions? And I'm just thinking, do you have a stronger win rate in North America versus global? And do you expect any sort of big order inflection in the back half of the year? Thanks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, good question. No, certainly the moratorium had an impact as investments paused. It was difficult, obviously, to think about financing, obtain financing in an environment where there was uncertainty of whether you could actually export the product. So we saw the delays in place there, which resulted in a significantly lower amount of awards to EPCs in 2024, as I described. In terms of the win rate itself, no. Look, we put significant effort over the last two and a half years to create an understanding and develop relationships in North America to ensure that we could be in a winning position.\nBut our story is even stronger, to be very honest, if you look at Middle East and Africa, where the early projects existed in Qatar predominantly. And so we feel really good globally, and our teams continue to operate and pursue in a very consistent fashion and win in a very consistent fashion around the world.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, all.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nOperator\n\nYeah, I wanted to come back to the power and renewables portion of the funnel. Pretty healthy contribution in the Q1 there on the project wins. Any context you can offer on the elongation of the sales cycle there or when these wins might begin to convert to the order backlog?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, not really a whole lot of color. You can imagine, I think, much like LNG, these are large, particularly when you're talking about additional capacity. Those are long lead time projects that take time to work themselves through backlog. I will suggest, however, and I'll ask Ram to add some color, that in the modernizations or capacity expansions, those go pretty quick. They're a little faster to bring online. So it really varies. But you're thinking about building a new combined cycle power plant, that's a five-year, six-year type of venture. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I think you said it. The modernization projects, which actually had a significant impact in Q1 orders performance for us in power, will go through faster in terms of conversion to sales. But certainly, the nuclear projects, which is a good portion of our funnel, as well as the combined cycle greenfield plants, take much longer to convert to sales.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay, got it. And then just a follow-up on orders, so up 1% in the quarter. What are you assuming for order growth for the year as part of this operating framework on the sales side? And then any color on book-to-bill embedded as part of the planning assumptions?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, but we don't forecast the orders publicly, so we're not going to comment on that. book-to-bill was greater than one, yeah, in the Q1. Book-to-bill was greater than one. We will see our typical seasonal book-to-bill with the first half being greater than one and the back half being under one. For the full year, I'll tell you that we're expecting book-to-bill to be about one. Yeah.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay, great. Appreciate the detail. Best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\n[inaudible]\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThe good news is, Deane, you didn't miss anything. We didn't comment on January. I'm not going to comment on it, but beginning of the quarter, and we feel good about the guide we just put out there.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. I know there was a reference to mega projects, and there's still lots of focus on where and how they play out. There was a reference to them on the automation side. Just what's your setup? What's your expectation? How might there be some ways you benefit and some of the starts that are coming, we think, over the next 12 months?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Deane, Ram Krishnan here. On the project funnel, the areas where I think we are well positioned to certainly capitalize are twofold. LNG, which Lal described in very much detail, and there's a big pipeline of new liquefaction capacity coming down the pipe, both in North America as well as in Qatar, where we're well positioned, and then certainly the power industry. But across the board, activity in terms of chemical modernizations in North America, greenfield chemical in the Middle East, certainly life sciences, diabetes-driven drugs, and investments in the US. So there's plenty of activity across life sciences, metals, and mining as well, where we feel pretty good.\nSo the $11.5 billion funnel, which, if you take semiconductors out, was $11.2 billion and up 7% year-over-year, represents a pretty robust set of activities across a diversified set of industries we're pursuing.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSaree Boroditsky\n\nSVP and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks for taking the question. You mentioned some of the costs and scenario actions you realized in the quarter as driving the margin. Could you just talk about how that plays out over the remainder of the year? I think you talked about some discretionary costs coming back starting in Q2, so maybe if we should expect less of a benefit going forward. Thank you.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nWell, yes, there will be a certainly compared to Q1, there will be a tempering of some of that cost reduction, but the cost reduction benefits will continue throughout the year. I think the other thing that we touched on that's important to think about is gross margin in Q1 was particularly high due to mix, and that will temper a bit as the year goes on as well. So I touched on the other drivers as you think about moving forward in comparing Q1 to the rest of the year, particularly around FX, which was the one point in the quarter. But we will continue to drive cost reductions throughout the year, and that will be an uplift to the margin as we move forward.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, you said it, Mike. I think price cost, which was positive in Q1, continues through the year. Cost reductions, which was positive in Q1, continues through the year. What will change is fundamentally the mix dynamic, which was hugely positive in Q1 and drove the 28% EBITDA margin at the segment level, will change. We've modeled that into the year. As well as dynamics around discretionary spend, which was throttled in the Q1, some of that, as Mike referenced, will come back. So that's how I would think about modeling margins for the rest of the year.\n\nSaree Boroditsky\n\nSVP and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. And just a quick one on the discretionary comments here. You talked about factory automation and auto as markets you're watching. Just maybe comment on what you're seeing from both of those and how you expect those to potentially accelerate in the second half.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I mean, both those markets have remained pretty depressed. Auto, very depressed, particularly on the EV side.Then certainly on the factory automation, though we've seen pockets of activity in North America, Europe, Germany, and then certainly China, where we have that exposure, have been muted. We are not expecting significant recovery on an absolute basis as we move into the second half, but the power of easier comparisons in the second half will drive growth in both those segments, and that's how it's modeled in for the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYeah, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the overall pace of control system competitive conversions. I think that's part of your story. A lot of end market focus today. But curious about win rate trends as you leverage the combined technology portfolio across Emerson for competitive displacement. Any updates on any revenue model changes there in terms of the install value versus recurring maintenance with the control system side of the business?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I mean, no major changes as it relates to, I think, the installed base win and the MRO conversions. That's pretty consistent with how we have traditionally operated in our control systems business, both with DeltaV Innovation. I think the competitive displacements, particularly in our power business, continue. That's been a strength of how we've driven differentiated growth in that space, and certainly with DeltaV as well. But we couldn't point to any significant change in the level of activity there. I think it's consistent with how we've performed in the past, and we continue to gain momentum.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then you talked a lot about margins on an overall Emerson level. I think in particular, measurement and analytical, and control systems and software hit kind of new threshold levels of profitability. And that doesn't get explained by AspenTech having a really strong quarter for Emerson's overall mix. So curious if you could talk a little bit about those couple of segments of profitability.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nEVP and CFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, so for the systems business, they had a very strong gross margin quarter. They had some favorable closeouts of projects due to strong execution. And they also benefited quite a bit from the SG&A spend during the quarter. And then on the MSOL business, the measurement analytical business, they had pretty consistent gross margins quarter to quarter, very good gross margins, but consistent, and benefited from the SG&A. And that was in part due to the work that was done last year to take some cost out of that cost phase.They had some discretionary as well. That's what was going on with those two, and we're really pleased with the performance there.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nSounds great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session, and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Mettler, the floor is yours, ma'am.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson Q3 2024 earnings conference call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Michael Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor Statement and note on non-GAAP measures. All financial metrics in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis. On 6 June 2024, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our remaining interests in the Copeland Joint Venture. We have included additional information and the accounting treatment of these transactions in the appendix of the presentation.\nI will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. Please turn to slide three. I would like to thank the 65,000 Emerson employees around the world for delivering another solid set of results. Your commitment to our vision and passion for our purpose comes to life every day. I am moved by our customer focus and the deep care you have for each other, and I am proud and honored to work alongside each of you. Thank you to the Board of Directors for your support of the management team and to our shareholders for your trust in us. Since I became CEO in 2021, we have talked openly about the transformation of Emerson, driven around the three pillars of culture, portfolio, and execution. We have moved rapidly to improve across all three.\nBefore we discuss the quarterly financial results, I want to highlight the results of our latest employee survey to show our employees are with us on this journey as our culture continues to evolve. Our latest company-wide engagement survey, inclusive of Test and Measurement, had a participation rate of 89%, up 1.4 points from our 2023 survey. We had an engagement score of 79%, a one-point improvement, and only one point from world-class levels of 80%. While this is an evergreen journey and we still have work to do, I am excited about the tangible steps we have taken to create a more inclusive and engaged organization. Now, let's jump into the operating results. Q3 was another solid quarter for Emerson.\nOrders in the quarter returned to growth and were up 3% year over year, driven by strong project activity in our Process and hybrid businesses, especially across life sciences, energy, and power. Notably, we won several large life science projects in North America and Europe, focused on expanding production capabilities for advanced medicines. The Middle East and Latin America saw exceptional demand, and we were awarded several large projects in each. As we expected, Process and hybrid markets remained steady at mid-single-digit growth as we continued to see investment, particularly in LNG, life sciences, energy, and sustainability. While capital project investments continued to progress, MRO orders were slightly softer than expected in the quarter. Discrete automation orders were softer than expected, down low single digits, both year over year and sequentially, as factory automation and markets remained weak.\nThe green shoots we were beginning to see through April and May took a step back in June, and we are now expecting a slower recovery. Though we expect discrete automation orders to be flat to slightly positive in Q4 on a low base of comparison. Excluded from underlying, Test and measurement orders remained soft, down 11%. Additionally, for total Emerson, we saw a weaker demand environment in China across most of our business segments. We now expect low single-digit underlying order growth for the second half and for the full year. Emerson delivered strong operating results with margin leverage, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow, all exceeding expectations. Sales came in at the low end of our guide, and I'll provide additional color on the next slide. Due to weaker orders, Test and measurement sales also came in slightly below expectations.\nHowever, profitability met expectations as we are seeing the impact of our synergy realization. Transportation and semiconductor markets remained weak, while aerospace and defense performed well, and we saw continued government spending and research. The European market was softer than expected amid lingering EV demand concerns, and China remained sluggish across most test and measurement segments. Due to this, we are looking into the second half of 2025 for recovery in this business. With softer orders, we are adjusting our full-year sales to be $1.45 to 1.5 billion, but the accelerated synergy actions we have taken will help protect profitability and position the business well for a return to growth. We continue to be excited by the value creation potential of our differentiated portfolio.\nEmerson's strong performance through the first nine months and resolute focus driven by our Emerson management system gives us the confidence to execute on our 2024 plan. We expect underlying sales of approximately 6%, and are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide to $5.45-5.50. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately $2.8 billion. We look forward to a strong finish to 2024 and are energized to deliver continued value creation for our shareholders. Please turn to slide four. Underlying sales growth was 3%. Life sciences and power markets continue to perform well, both up double-digit as we executed key projects across North America and Europe. Europe is seeing continued strength in energy, power, and sustainability markets, as well as their MRO business, particularly in Western Europe.\nIn the Americas, broad-based healthy growth across Latin America was slightly offset by slower MRO in North America. Robust performance in the Middle East, driven by strong project activity, was offset by broad-based weakness in Asia. Continuing the exceptional gross margin performance from last quarter, gross margins were 52.8% in Q3, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year. Our gross profit percentage year-to-date is 50.6%, even with the acquisition and integration costs incurred in Q1. This gives us confidence in our expectation that this portfolio would deliver greater than 50% gross margins as we look forward. Operating leverage was 67%, significantly stronger than expected due to better performance from AspenTech, project mix, and realization of more cost reductions than expected from actions taken throughout the year. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations at $1.43, above the top end of our guide and up 11% from 2023.\nEmerson generated robust free cash flow of $975 million, up 27% year over year, and with a free cash flow margin of 22.3% for the quarter. Michael will walk through additional details on our results in a few slides. We are pleased to deliver another strong quarter and are excited to continue demonstrating the value creation potential of our transformed portfolio. Please turn to slide five. We continue to see strong capital project investments, with our strategic project funnel now at $11 billion, up approximately $200 million from Q2. The funnel growth demonstrates the strong, sustained capital cycle aligned to our growth programs, as the increase predominantly came from projects supporting energy transition, life sciences, sustainability, and decarbonization. In Q3, Emerson was awarded approximately $350 million of project content, consistent with prior quarters.\nWe had wins in large traditional energy projects, as well as additional awards from offshore vessels in Brazil, as mentioned last quarter. Our growth programs also performed well in the quarter, accounting for a little under half of the awards, and I want to highlight a few key wins. Emerson was selected to automate Nemaska Lithium's Whabouchi mine at the Bécancour Lithium Conversion Facility projects in Québec, Canada, based on our proven ability to provide a differentiated solution, including a common control platform across sites. This mine is one of the largest high-purity lithium deposits in North America. Fueled by hydroelectric power, the Bécancour facility will convert the spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide. This is the first such conversion in Canada, and Nemaska Lithium projects will play an important role in the North America battery value chain.\nEmerson will provide much of our leading technology to automate both facilities, including DeltaV control systems and software, reliability solutions, valves, and instruments. This example highlights the breadth of the Emerson portfolio and demonstrates how we are well-suited to serve this emerging market. Next, I'd like to highlight Emerson was selected to support one of the largest renewable energy park projects in India, spearheaded by one of India's largest and most prominent renewable energy companies. Emerson will provide our Ovation Green SCADA solution, including pitch control and park power management for the wind turbines. Emerson was chosen for our scalable automation software and technologies that enhance wind turbine performance, as well as our comprehensive local support capabilities, including engineering, field support, and production.\nFinally, Emerson was chosen to automate a key green hydrogen project in Uzbekistan, which will use a 52-MW onshore wind farm to produce 3,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, which will be used to manufacture 500,000 tons of ammonia fertilizer. ACWA Power, a first mover on green hydrogen and part of the NEOM Green Hydrogen project, will operate the plant, and HDEC will design and construct the facility. Emerson was selected for our advanced technologies and domain expertise and will provide several technologies from our hydrogen portfolio, including instruments, control valves, and our Ovation Green control system. Turning to slide six, we remain focused on driving our strategic priorities, including accelerating innovation for profitable growth and enhancing our position as a global leader in automation. One of our breakthrough innovation priorities is software-defined automation.\nOur industry-leading Ovation Automation Platform just launched a software-defined, AI-ready platform for the power and water industries. The Ovation Automation Platform 4.0 builds upon our Boundless Automation vision to bring a unifying data fabric across the organizations to optimize operations from device to enterprise. Ovation 4.0 brings customer-focused innovation, such as secure generative AI models, to offer prescriptive operations and maintenance guidance together in a robust solutions portfolio. It also offers integration with our Ovation Green software to improve holistic awareness across traditional and renewable power generation and storage to aid customers who have an increasingly complex mix of generating assets. Customer-focused innovation is a hallmark of Emerson, and I wanted to highlight one of the key methods we have for formal engagements. Our Ovation business recently held their 37th users' conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with 70% of US.\nPower utilities participating in a multi-day event focused on the power and water industries. This conference featured interactive technology exhibits, customer case studies, and collaborative industry sessions focused on emerging technical and business topics. Ovation users' group creates a world-class engagement as users provide direct input for potential project product enhancements, which helps inform our strategic product development plans. We also took a key step forward in our transformation and simplification journey in Q3 as we announced a definitive agreement to sell our remaining interest in the Copeland Joint Venture. Private equity funds managed by Blackstone will purchase the equity stake while Copeland repurchased the seller's note. The transaction involving the Copeland note receivable closed on 2 August with pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.9 billion, which will be used to pay down debt. We expect the equity portion to close by the end of August.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael Baughman to walk through our financial results in more detail.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide seven to discuss our Q3 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 3%, led by our process and hybrid businesses, and partially offset by continued softness in discrete. Price contributed two points of growth. Underlying growth was similar across regions, with Europe up 4%, the Americas up 3%, and Asia and the Middle East up 2%. Intelligent devices grew 2%, while software and control grew 7%. AspenTech sales were stronger than expected, growing at 7%. Discrete automation was down mid-single digits, lower than expected due to a slower pace of recovery amidst continued market weakness. Test and measurement, which is not included in the underlying metric, contributed $355 million to our net sales, slightly below expectations for the quarter.\nAs expected, backlog decreased slightly from Q2 and exited Q3 at $7.4 billion. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 20 basis points to 27.1% due to strong gross margin performance, favorable price cost, and the benefit of cost reductions. This quarter's adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.1% is a record high compared to 26.9% last year in Q3, which was the previous record high. Test and measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.4%, sequentially flat on slightly lower volume as we continue to see the benefit of our synergy actions. Operating leverage excluding test and measurement was 67%, exceeding expectations. This outperformance was driven by a higher portion of software revenue and fewer lower-margin project shipments than expected, offset by negative geographic mix. Strong quarters from AspenTech and control systems and software benefited leverage.\nDiscrete automation had sequential margin improvement from cost actions we took as we saw market conditions continue to decline. The operating leverage from our test and from our measurement and analytical business was diluted in the quarter, primarily due to geographic mix and slower MRO. Adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $1.43, and I will discuss that in more depth on the next chart. Finally, free cash flow was $975 million, up 27% versus the prior year and above expectations. This was driven by earnings and improvements in working capital, especially in inventory and receivables. Free cash flow margin in the quarter was 22.3%, inclusive of $40 million of cash outflow for acquisition-related costs, integration activities, and elevated capital expenditures. To date, we have incurred $210 million of the anticipated $250 million headwind we discussed last November. Please turn to slide eight.\nOur adjusted earnings per share increased $0.14 from the prior year. Strong performance from operations, especially in our software and control businesses, contributed $0.16. Corporate was a $0.02 drag due to a higher income tax rate caused by an earnings mix skewed toward higher-rate jurisdictions. AspenTech contributed an incremental $0.03 versus the prior year, higher than expected due to outperformance in GACV and higher revenue. Test and measurement contributed $0.09, slightly below expectations driven by lower volume. We also had a $0.01 headwind to expectations in Q3 as we stopped accruing interest income from the Copeland note receivable when we reached a definitive agreement to sell it on 6 June 2024. Please turn to the next slide for details on our updated guidance for 2024.\nFiscal year 2024 underlying sales are now expected to grow approximately 6%, in line with the midpoint of our May guidance, which is supported by our process and hybrid businesses, which continue to perform well amid a delayed discrete recovery, and a weaker China. Reported net sales growth is expected to be approximately 15%, with test and measurement contributing approximately 9.5 points of growth, offset by a half-point drag from FX. We are increasing our operating leverage expectations to the mid to high 40s, driven by the strong leverage performance through the first nine months and strong leverage expected in Q4. We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS guidance and expect $5.45-5.50. Test and measurement is now expected to contribute $0.42-0.44.\nTest and measurement is a business with very strong leverage, so the impact of our synergy actions is helping maintain profitability despite a weaker volume environment than initially planned. For the full year, we expect test and measurement's adjusted segment EBITDA margin to be approximately 23%, a couple points above the prior year, benefiting from the synergy realization. With AspenTech's strong results in Q3, we are bringing their expected EPS contribution back up to $0.32-0.34. We are also raising our free cash flow expectations for the year to approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the working capital improvements and Q3's performance. Dividend and tax rate expectations are unchanged, and we now expect approximately $300 million of share repurchase. We have been focused on debt paydown, particularly with short-term interest rates staying higher for longer, and we retired EUR 500 million of term debt that came due in Q3.\nOur performance through the first nine months has exceeded expectations, and we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Our transformed portfolio is meaningfully improved, with higher profitability driven by gross profit margins above 50% and higher organic growth driven by secular trends, and our Emerson management system is driving operational excellence. With that, I'll turn the call over to the Q&A portion of our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. At this time, we will just pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nThe first question we have will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, two questions, one big picture and one smaller picture, I guess. First off, kind of the big picture stuff. Hey, Lal, this idea of kind of software-defined automation and what you're doing with Ovation, I think this is also sort of instrumental to better collaborating, integrating, whatever you want to say, between DeltaV and Aspen's offerings. Maybe you could kind of address that, if I'm correct in that assumption, and where you're at and sort of kind of propagating that change in technology posture across the rest of the portfolio.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, good morning, Jeff. Good to hear from you. No, you're absolutely right. As we laid out that vision, it certainly is designed to accomplish a couple of factors.\nThe first being to liberate the data that exists in silos across operations and broad industry. And the second then is to actually use the analytics power to drive productivity, efficiency, higher levels of safety, and efficiency with analytic packages, inclusive of much of what AspenTech can bring to the table to optimize facilities and production. So that vision certainly exists. We are on the path to bring compute out of centralized siloed data approaches into the edge, which is a first step with products that are already released in the marketplace with DeltaV. And we'll continue to move forward to deliver on the vision. But this step with Ovation was very critical as well because, as you know, that serves the power and water industries exclusively, and to be able to bring that capability into those markets was critical.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nRight.\nAnd then kind of more near term, and I may have missed it. I was on five or 10 minutes late. But kind of the shorter cycle elements of the portfolio, just your view on when discrete bottoms, when NI bottoms, you brought down the order outlook a little bit for the year, which is probably tied to those end markets. But maybe just what you see as we start to look into 2025 and the eventual bottoming and turning in those end markets.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, certainly. So the discrete cycle recovery has been slower than expected. We certainly believe that we can get close to positive orders in the last quarter of the year here on discrete, but that will be, of course, based on some very weak comparisons. But that will start us on the path to recovery into 2025. Test and measurement, a little slower.\nWe're watching our customers very carefully there, speaking, engaging with them. We're watching our peers in the marketplace as well and their performance. We foresee sales turning positive there in H2 2025, with orders turning positive in H1 2025. Then lastly, Jeff, I'll just add that offsetting a lot of that is what continues to be a strong capital cycle formation cycle here with process and hybrid markets, and also momentum in what we see at AspenTech. So those offset a little bit of how we're thinking. Certainly, I believe that as we think about 2025 and start to guide that, we will be probably towards the lower end of that range that we've given on our through-the-cycle expectations, but well within that.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\nThanks for the question. Just want to pick up on the last question from Jeff there. The $1.45-1.5 billion range for test and measurement in the four keys is actually quite wide. So I think just given the expectation that we don't get to revenue growth until the second half of the year, it seems that we're tracking towards the lower end of that range. Just wanted to make sure that was correct.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nWe got it because we still have confidence that we can hit within that guide, Nigel. I certainly wouldn't write it up to the low end of the range at this point. This is the best guide that we feel we can commit to as a management team. Obviously, at some point in the midpoint is how you can think about it.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, great.\nJust to kind of zoom in out to sort of a general comment on the environment out there, obviously, we've seen deterioration in sort of general industrial markets. Feels like some projects are getting delayed with some of the uncertainty, maybe higher rates. Just give us an overview in terms of what you're seeing out there from customers, maybe a bit more of an end market overview. Just wondering, obviously, the funnel remains very vibrant, increased slightly Q to Q. But what about this funnel-to-order kind of conversion process? Are you starting to see longer decision-making?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYep. Thanks, Nigel. Yeah, I'll comment. Of course, the funnel did grow, as you noted. We booked approximately an equal amount that we've been booking historically on a quarterly basis, $350 million in value.\nThe mix changes a little bit depending on end market timing, and we shared that with you as well in the deck. So I continue to look at the funnel and the capital formation cycle in a positive manner. I haven't seen degradation of projects or projects being eliminated. I haven't seen any slowdown in the expansion of the sustainability projects or the LNG, particularly as it relates to the Middle East and Africa. So I'm still very optimistic there. Now, what we do, we are watching very carefully, is that projects that have been booked, the pace at which our customers are willing to accept product, whether there are delays that are being implemented around inspections and other areas; we're watching that very carefully.\nAnd we have experienced some of that in the quarter, which obviously contributed to our lower sales, 3% versus the low end of our guide versus the expectation. But there's some of that going on, which obviously we're watching very carefully.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nI would just add to that, Nigel, some of that read through in the leverage this quarter. We talked in the comments about some projects that did get pushed out, which was a little addition by subtraction because those projects are generally lower margin. So it was part of the 67% in the quarter. That's a very good point. And of course, lastly, Nigel, to the question, our process and hybrid orders are still up mid-single digits. And that's important to recognize.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSounds great. Thanks, Lal.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. And next, we have Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody, and congrats on navigating through the choppiness here. I'm kind of curious. I mean, you're going to have a fair amount of cash on hand once you get this Copeland thing done. Seems kind of in a good spot from a leverage. Do you feel like you—I mean, I guess my question really is, what do you plan to do on the proceeds? But I guess more explicitly, do you feel like you have the capacity to do M&A, or are we still digesting NI at this point and want to focus on that?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, certainly. I feel great about the balance sheet and what we have to do in terms of maintaining our investment grade. And I think that's very important. We are working very hard to integrate National Instruments and feel really good about the progress that that team continues to make.\nIt's a set of markets that we like that will drive differentiation and through the cycle growth for our company. I think that we feel very good. Having said all that, we will have the capacity if we wish to put that balance sheet to work. That's something that Scott, as you know, will continue to evaluate with time and on what the right move would be in terms of the majority position that we own in AspenTech.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Fair enough. I wanted to follow up on Jeff's question on Ovation because I think you put it on a slide, and it's not a product line. I think historically, you guys had talked about a lot, but it is a pretty powerful installed base that you have. I mean, how big a deal is this 4.0 upgrade?\nIs there a way for us to think about what percentage of your installed base you would expect to upgrade? Or is there some sort of kind of way to tangibly think about the impact of this iteration? Is iteration even the right word to use? Is it a step change, a meaningful step change where you kind of hit that tipping point where people, like you said, 70% of the people came to your event, where people just generally hit the bid on that more so than maybe they did in the past? Any color there would be helpful, Lal.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. From an Ovation perspective, we've continued to have significant releases in the capabilities of that technology over time.\nThis is certainly a significant one, which incorporates a lot of technology from Aspen and fundamentally from an optimization perspective, from an analytics perspective, and in terms of copilots, provides capability that we've not had in Ovation before. I think it is significant given the fact that the investment in the power generation infrastructure in this country and globally is at a tipping point. Just given the boom in AI and data centers, and we talked about it in the last earnings call, we expect the power generation investments, as well as transmission, distribution, and renewables, to be a very, very important growth vector for us. Ovation 4.0 certainly positions us very well in that capacity.\nAnd frankly, on greenfield or modernizations or lifetime extensions of power plants, but also the opportunity to go in and upgrade existing systems with the new capabilities that we have in 4.0. So that's really what we're very excited about.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nAnd I think the step change here, to your question, Scott, lands on the use of the AI models, which will enable planning purposes around maintenance, taking down assets for turnaround activity. It will give a higher probability that you're actually going to work on the maintenance records and elements that are most needed in the plant. And I think that's incrementally new and different in the marketplace. And then lastly, Scott, we're highlighting this innovation, but innovation is a core pathway, as we've talked in the past, of how we drive differentiated growth at Emerson. Accelerated innovation across our businesses is critical. And we've seen that.\nYou see that as we report R&D spend as a percent of sales, that we have stepped that up. And this is an element and one of the results of that.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we have Deane Dray of RBC Capital.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, I'd like to go back to page five and ask whether you're seeing much demand or overlap with the mega projects. I guess the latest count is 440 projects over a billion. How much does this funnel overlay to those, and what kind of visibility do you have?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nSo, in terms of, I'm not quite sure the reference you made, Deane. Can you clarify the mega projects you referenced?\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah.\nThis has been a big focus across the industrials for the past year, looking at North America non-res construction projects over a billion dollars. It encompasses everything from software to batteries. It's a way for us to look at all these secular drivers and how are they translating actually into projects. It's become this benchmark indicator that we're using now. That's the reason I'm asking. You're looking at this funnel. It's a global funnel, I get it. For North America, how much overlap do you have with these so-called mega projects? Or maybe you don't have that information.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. We'll go back and map that. What I will tell you is, in terms of LNG, in terms of energy, in terms of life sciences, and frankly also semiconductors and EVs, we have our own map of all the project activity in North America.\nWe'll go back and map it with what you're referencing. But I will tell you that we are certainly participating, and every one of those projects are in our funnel with very, very good win rates. But it's an action we'll take away and work with Colleen and get that map. But our participation in North America on those large projects remains very solid. And we had a very good level of project activity in North America, particularly in life sciences, power, and the control systems business, even in the current quarter.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nYeah. And as a reminder, that funnel represents our automation content versus what the entirety of a project is out there in the universe. So that's also to keep in mind.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOf course. All right. So we'll be looking forward to that.\nThen the second question is a bit of a follow-up from Scott on the balance sheet and the cash. Just can you talk to the decrease in buybacks? I know you said that your use of capital was to buying back the Copeland note, but all cash is fungible. And just directionally, to be pulling away from buybacks, just maybe I know it's early to talk about 25, but just where do buybacks fit in your priorities?\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Deane, it's Mike. Yeah, buybacks are definitely still in the priority along with the dividend and returning capital shareholders generally. We will exit the year with the commercial paper paid off and $3.5+ billion of cash on the balance sheet. But our capital allocation will remain the same. We will continue to focus on funding our organic growth initiatives.\nWe'll continue to be committed to the dividend and bolt-on M&A that improves the portfolio. And then, of course, there'll be share buybacks. So yeah, we will continue with share buyback. We'll be in the market this quarter at, we think, roughly $125 million, which gets us back to that roughly $500 million a year pace.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nCould you just talk about the seasonality of your underlying cash flow, putting Aspen aside? Typically, I think you have a pretty strong Q4 historically, and you're raising it this year. I guess, how do we think about cash in the Q4 and then into next year?\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah.\nSo we took the guide up to 2.8, which would imply about $800 million coming through in the fourth quarter, which I think is reasonably consistent, seeing a fourth quarter increase. So this third quarter was particularly good. And remember, that has test and measurement in there, which they had a great quarter and peeled about $50 million off the balance sheet, which did skew the numbers this year. So we feel good about the 2.8 for the year. And looking at the 800, it looks pretty in line with some of the prior years.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nAnd then just looking out to next year, anything in the bridge that's more mechanical that you know of today, whether it's merit increases, bonus payments, or anything that's kind of outside the normal operating leverage dynamics that we should be aware of?\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nCan't think of anything in the kind of run the business.\nBut at corporate, I would say we are looking at a headwind and a tailwind that will largely offset and be a slight headwind. We will have an increase in pension expense, all things equal, just given the way the deferral accounting works. And then we'll have a lower interest expense because of the Copeland proceeds that come in. Those two should be net. Lower interest expense overall with more cash. Yeah. So that should net to a pretty small headwind at corporate.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nOkay. And then one last quick one for you guys. What are the plans for Aspen? Are you guys planning to move on that this year?\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNot in this fiscal, as I said. We'll continue to evaluate, Steve, as we go through time here.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nSorry. I meant, sorry. I'm already on to 25. I meant fiscal 25. I'm already thinking about next year. Sorry about that. Forward-looking.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo comment there.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nLal, operating leverage for Emerson has continued to be impressive. And obviously, you raised your guidance for this year to mid-40s, which is higher than the algorithm you gave us at your last investor day. We know price maybe is fading a bit as a help. Maybe supply chain winds are less likely to help in FY25. I think you just answered Steve's question about sort of other puts and takes. But can you sustain incrementals in the 40s in 2025 from what you see today?\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. We believe we can. We have a significantly higher margin portfolio today with a 1,000 basis point move over the transformation of Emerson to plus 50% GP portfolio.\nI think our expectation certainly is that next year will be very similar to the leverage rate of this year.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. And then, Lal, you mentioned you have decent visibility toward, I think, the low end of your 4% -7 through the cycle revenue growth as an initial read in FY25. I guess, what do you need to see to achieve that kind of growth?\n\nOperator\n\nDo you need, for instance? Yeah. Go ahead, Lal.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So I mean, obviously, what we're seeing right now is based on the order rates that the second half of this year will generate. And that points to the low end of the 4%-7. Now, what has to change? The areas we're really focused on are pace of discrete recovery, the amplitude of the recovery, and then China.\nAnd now, the North American KOB3, or the pace of business, is something we're watching. We're not really concerned. Our process hybrid business continues to have order rates of mid-single digits. The capital cycle still remains strong. So that we feel very good about. It's really the pace and amplitude of discrete recovery and China is going to dictate how we guide into next year as we come off that low single-digit order growth we've seen in the second half of 2024.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nLal, are you seeing China stable at low levels, or is it getting worse? What's China looking like right now?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'd suggest stable, Andy, at this point.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. I think.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning, Lal.\nMaybe where I wanted to start was just around the different end market verticals because I suppose the lowered orders guide and the slight miss on sales in Q3, was that solely tied to discrete automation? Because I suppose listening to an automation peer half an hour ago, they do talk about weaker energy transition CapEx, weaker chemicals, and mining spend. And Aspen last night referred to some weakness in those types of process verticals as well. So just trying to understand that element of sort of process versus discrete, the outlook there.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I'll answer and let Ram add some color as well from his perspective. Certainly, we continue to see strong capital formation cycle here, particularly as it relates to energy, energy transition, power generation, life sciences, metals, and mining.\nThat is relatively broad from Western Europe through the United States and into the Middle East and Latin America. So I don't have a whole lot of concern today around those markets. I highlighted a few specific wins, but there were others in that $350 million bucket that we won. So mid-single digit order growth in Process and hybrid in the quarter, low single digit for the company impacted by the discrete automation business and the discrete orders, which remains negative through the quarter. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And you said it. I mean, I think the cap for us, energy, power, life sciences is driving a majority of our capital project wins as well as the momentum in our Process hybrid business. Certainly, we are not a big player in hybrid markets like food and beverage, which could be the dynamic you're referencing in terms of some slowdown.\nBut our life sciences business continues to be very good. Our metals and mining business continues to be very good. So no slowdown. We're not seeing any kind of slowdown in that area. But the area we're watching very carefully, as I referenced, is the pace of discrete recovery, particularly markets like semiconductors and EVs, which impact NI, but also our markets like automotive, which impact our broader discrete automation business. Now, the one segment of test and measurement where we've seen good momentum is aerospace and defense driven by government spending. It's 25% of their overall mix. So that's certainly come out strong, and that's driven growth in North America. But we are yet to see sustained recoveries in semis and EVs, which are markets we're watching closely.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\nAnd then just my follow-up, and it's somewhat related, but if I look at your backlog, I think that was $7.4 billion at the end of June. So sort of down a little bit sequentially and down a little bit from where it was in December as well. When you think about that backlog, it's moving around into a year on seasonal factors as much as anything else. Do you still feel confident about sort of decent backlog growth as you enter fiscal 2025?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYes. Yes, we do. That backlog reduction for us, frankly, about $100 million, it was all in test and measurement. Our backlog in the base Emerson business was held effectively flat. Now, we typically see a backlog reduction in Q4, but it'll be up year over year, and we feel pretty good about backlog levels as we enter 2025.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI would add to the earlier comment about the capital formation. Interestingly, in the quarter, the control systems business actually had a book-to-bill above one, record order level. Record order levels. For the full year, we expect Emerson at right around one book-to-bill.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nYep. That's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Brett Linzey of Mizuho.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Hey, just wanted to come back to the discrete comments around pace and amplitude of the recovery. As that business comes back, should we think about the operating leverage above the 45% framework given some of the cost containment and some of the actions you've taken there?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I would say for our discrete automation business, it'll be right around in the 40s. Certainly, the other business that's exposed to the discrete end markets, test and measurement, given the 75+% GPs, will be much higher.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay.\nGot it. And then just on power generation, so you've talked about some of the momentum there in that business. I think the grid results at Aspen look pretty encouraging. Any update on the strategic funnel and how that tracked through the quarter and some of the activity you're working on there?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I mean, I think our OSI, so Aspen clearly referenced the capital formation in grid modernization, which is fundamentally transmission and distribution investments. So our exposure to the T&D side is through OSI at Aspen. On the power generation side, which is the Ovation business, that project funnel continues to build both in North America, Europe, but also we're having a very, very strong year in China, interestingly. So overall, the generation capacity that is being invested in across the globe continues to be robust.\nThe innovation that we're driving with the likes of Ovation 4.0, as well as our Ovation Green that is positioned for renewable investments, the activity there is very robust. Lal referenced that one project in India with a very strategic investment that's happening in India. The renewable space is just an example of the types of activities we're involved in with the Ovation platform.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Great. Appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer Holdings\n\nThanks. Good morning. I had a question on the MRO. Curious if how that performed specifically in the quarter. Sorry if I didn't catch it, but wondering if there's an impact of some customer inventory rebalancing, if you're seeing any of that from maybe accelerated lot sizes in prior years, or if end markets are mainly what you're seeing on the MRO side.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. This is Lal.\nCertainly, in totality, MRO didn't really change a whole lot. It remains at 64% of the revenue in the quarter, which is relatively consistent to where we've been and well within my expectation for the year. Having said that, there were a few ebbs and flows, as I discussed on the call. European MRO was very strong in the quarter. North America MRO was softer in the quarter. We haven't seen anything there that is alarming in any way. We're not a heavy inventory-driven company from a distribution or customer-level perspective. Our equipment's generally bought and put into operation shortly thereafter. And so consequently, nothing alarming on the MRO side. But again, strength in Europe, weakness in North America, or softness in North America characterized the quarter for MRO.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah.\nJust to build on that a little, the North American softness, you'll recall in prior quarters, we had talked about how, particularly in the measurement analytical business, there was some strength, and we saw a little bit of that reverse in the quarter. But as Lal said, nothing concerning.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer Holdings\n\nGotcha. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\nMaybe just starting with the T&M business. Sounds like the synergy progress is going a bit better than planned. Are you guys actually raising the synergy guidance there, or is it more about timing, coming through faster than expected, and maybe any updated thoughts on synergies in fiscal 2024?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo. Good morning. No. Look, we raised the guide a few quarters ago. We've continued to execute across that pace.\nSo no change to the synergy guide, but we are maintaining the pace, certainly, to be able to deliver these results.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Got it. Thanks, Lal. And then if I could ask a bit of a detailed, a little bit more detailed question. The discrete automation comps do get a lot easier in the fourth quarter. Is it possible that organic revenue could turn positive, or do you think that that's more of an H1 2025 event at this point?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGo ahead.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. It's an H1 2025. I think orders turned positive in Q4. At this point, we're planning on an H1 2025 recovery in sales for the discrete automation business.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nMichael Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWell, this concludes our question-and-answer session and today's event. I would like to thank the management team for their time today and thank you all for attending today's presentation.\nAt this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a great day, everyone.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star, then one, on a touch-tone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson Q2 2024 earnings conference call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on slide two.\nThis presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor Statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking Emerson's global team for yet again delivering very strong operating results. It is a testament of the strength of our people, the culture we are building, the portfolio we have created, and the value of the Emerson management system. I would also like to thank the Emerson Board of Directors for your continued support of the management team and to our shareholders for the trust you place in us.\nThe Q2 was characterized by strong operating performance, which exceeded our expectations. We continue to have confidence in the underlying market conditions driven by demand in the process and hybrid markets, aligned with secular macro trends: energy security and affordability, sustainability, nearshoring, and digital transformation. The P&L execution was nearly flawless in the quarter. Underlying sales grew 8%, operations leveraged at 54%, expanding EBITDA by 140 basis points to 26%, and delivering 25% EPS growth and 32% free cash flow growth.\n2024 is the year of execution, with no major portfolio moves planned, and through the first half, we feel confident and have raised our outlook for the year. We are energized about the power of our differentiated automation portfolio. Our NI team, led by Ritu Favre, continues to drive the integration plan and have again accelerated cost-out activities in response to a slower-than-anticipated market recovery. We will now deliver $100 million of synergies in 2024. Further, I'm excited about David Baker's appointment as CFO of AspenTech. Dave is an experienced global automation CFO and a 27-year veteran of Emerson.\nHe will bring a degree of structure, forecasting accuracy, and work with Antonio Pietri to reinforce a diligent management process. Lastly, I remain excited about what we can accomplish at Emerson. Our technology stack, comprised of intelligent devices, control, and software, is highly differentiated in the marketplace, delivering scaled value to our customers. Further, innovation is alive and well at Emerson, and we continue to stretch the boundaries of the possible in automation. Please turn to slide three.\nEmerson and our board are committed to ongoing board refreshments, and today, we have the privilege of announcing the newest member elected to our Board of Directors. Calvin Butler is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, the nation's largest utility company by customer count and a member of its Board of Directors. As part of Exelon and its operating companies, Calvin has held senior management roles in executive management, operations, corporate affairs, and regulatory and external affairs.\nHe is a passionate advocate for community equity, and his unique expertise in reliable, clean, and affordable energy solutions will benefit Emerson as we continue to enable the energy transition and decarbonization for our broad customer base. He also has a local connection, as he was born and raised in St. Louis and graduated with a law degree from Washington University's School of Law. Calvin will officially join our board on 1 August 2024. This will expand Emerson's board to 12 members, half of whom are women or people of color.\nHaving the right skills represented on Emerson's board is critical to our continued success, and we are excited to have Calvin join us. Please turn to slide four. The Q2 exceeded our expectations, and our strong results highlight our continued focus on execution. Sales, operating leverage, and adjusted earnings all exceeded Q2 expectations.Stronger volumes were driven by outstanding operational performance and more backlog conversion than expected. Price, cost, and business segment mix were also more favorable than expected. Orders in the first half met our low single-digit growth expectations with a book-to-bill greater than one.\nFor the first half, process and hybrid saw mid-single-digit growth, while, as expected, discrete saw a decline of mid-single-digit. The demand environment for process and hybrid markets remains favorable. Discrete automation orders were down year-over-year on a tough comparison but were up sequentially low single digits, and we now expect their orders to turn positive in Q4, a quarter delay from our original expectation. While not impacting underlying, test and measurement orders were softer than anticipated in Q2, down 15%.\nFor the second half, we expect mid-single-digit underlying growth in orders and low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth for the full year, led by process and hybrid resilience with delayed discrete improvement. Test and measurement continues to perform and delivered slightly better than expected Q2 results for both sales and earnings. The turn to positive orders in this business is now expected in the first half of 2025, Q2 delayed than our original expectation. We are seeing continued softness in transportation and semiconductor demand driven by constrained CapEx environment, while aerospace and defense is expected to be positive due to continued strength in government research and defense spending.\nThis extended downturn enables another acceleration of synergy actions, and we now expect to realize $100 million of synergies in 2024, up from our prior expectation of $80 million as we pull in additional actions that will begin this quarter and were in the plan for 2025. Our differentiated portfolio is driving value creation for our shareholders. While we remain cautious on the timing of a recovery in discrete end markets and were slightly impacted by AspenTech's latest guidance revision, Emerson's first-half performance, stable process and hybrid demand, and additional self-help actions provide confidence to increase our full-year guidance.\nWe are increasing our underlying sales guidance to 5.5% to 6.5% and raising our adjusted EPS expectations to $5.40 to $5.50. We remain focused on execution and integration this year, leveraging our Emerson management system, and we are energized as we look ahead at the strength of our new portfolio to deliver differentiated results. Our leading technology and exposure to secular growth markets pave the way for continued value creation. Please turn to slide five. Emerson's Q2 exceeded guidance in underlying sales and profitability.\nUnderlying sales for the quarter grew 8%, with our process and hybrid businesses again exceeding expectations and better backlog conversion than initially expected. Energy security and affordability and sustainability commitments drove strong performance in energy, LNG, chemical, and power. Hybrid end market strength continued with life sciences project momentum in North America, Europe, and Asia, and robust metals and mining activity. Factory automation demand remained soft, with continued weakness in China, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East were particularly strong in the quarter, with persistent strength in process markets driven by energy transition and traditional energy markets.\nOne noteworthy example is India, which has seen double-digit growth in five of the last , including this quarter, driven by broad economic expansion across multiple segments. Our growth platforms also continue to perform strongly, with underlying sales up double-digit in the quarter. Our profitability continues to reflect the strength of our new portfolio. Gross margin has significantly improved since we started our portfolio journey when I took over as CEO in 2021. Gross margins at that time were in the low 40s, and in this fiscal year, we expect to achieve gross margins over 50%, nearly a 1,000 basis point improvement. In Q2, gross margin was 52.2%, a 430 basis point improvement from the prior year.\nOperating leverage was 54%, stronger than our expected low to mid-40s, again due to stronger volumes and favorable price, cost, and mix. Adjusted EPS also came in ahead of plan at $1.36, $0.10 above the top end of our guide and up 25% from 2023. Emerson generated free cash flow of $675 million, up 32% year-over-year. Mike Baughman will go through additional details on our results in a few slides. We are pleased with our Q2 performance and the persistent strength in our process and hybrid businesses, giving us additional confidence as we look to the rest of the year.\nPlease turn to slide six. Our strategic project funnel continues to grow and now sits at $10.8 billion, up approximately $400 million from Q1, with our growth programs up by $300 million and representing nearly two-thirds of the funnel. The funnel growth is in line with a constructive CapEx environment for our process and hybrid customers. This also reflects our exposure to robust secular trends, as the increase primarily came from projects supporting sustainability, decarbonization, and energy security and affordability.\nIn the Q2, Emerson was awarded approximately $350 million of project content, with the increase in traditional energy stemming from the award of several large offshore vessels in Brazil. Our growth programs continue to demonstrate success, and I want to highlight three key project wins. First, Emerson and AspenTech were awarded an automation pilot project for a large chemical company in China. This is an important synergy win, as the customer is developing a pathway to software-driven autonomous operations.\nThe multi-year agreement is an integrated solution for Emerson and AspenTech software that will provide high-fidelity hybrid models and control automation for optimizing process operations based on real-time production data to increase product yield and reduce energy consumption. This example showcases the unique ability of the integrated Emerson and AspenTech portfolio to provide differentiated solutions for our customers. In the energy transition space, Emerson was selected to support Shell's proposed Polaris carbon capture project in Canada.\nPolaris, subject to final investment decision by Shell, would capture CO2 from the refinery and chemical plant located at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Scotford, Alberta. Emerson is providing much of our leading technology, including instruments and valves. And finally, Emerson was chosen to automate a $4 billion manufacturing complex being built in Indiana by a large US-based life science customer. Emerson will provide our leading DeltaV control systems and software portfolio, including a five-year subscription agreement for our DeltaV MES. Please turn to slide seven.\nThis is a transformative moment for the US power industry, as data centers are driving electricity demand increases not seen since the early 2000s. At the same time, power producers are retiring carbon-intensive assets in a drive to decarbonize their operations and investing in the resilience and optimization of the grid. The grid is also experiencing an unprecedented shift from the unidirectional grid of the past to a bidirectional, intelligent grid of the future, which will be increasingly supported by intermittent power sources. There are multiple factors driving this generational increase in US electricity demand, and data centers alone account for nearly 1/3 of all new US electrical demand.\nAI data center racks consume significantly more power than traditional data centers, with a search on ChatGPT consuming six to 10 times the power of a traditional search on Google. Hyperscalers are revising CapEx estimates upward and increasing annual CapEx significantly in 2024 and build their AI infrastructure. This is expected to continue for multiple years. The increase in demand is real, and it is happening today. Utilities in key regions across the US are revising load growth estimates upward materially from recent years' estimates.\nGeorgia Power issued a revised assessment in which projected load growth was 17 times greater than previously forecast, resulting in approximately 30% greater total winter peak demand for the 2030 to 2031 winter. Dominion Energy has been a key beneficiary of traditional data center growth, and forecasting another tailwind for AI data Centers, more than doubling their 10-year average annual summer peak load growth from 2022. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation recently put out their annual nine-year growth forecast, with new demand more than doubling from the prior year forecast.\nWhile Emerson does not have material content in data centers, Emerson is a key player in the power industry for generation, transmission, and distribution, all of which are set to be beneficiaries. Approximately 9% of Emerson's sales are in power, and while we have a strong portfolio across our technology stack, I want to highlight the software and control layer, which is relevant across the power landscape from generation, through transmission, and distribution.\nThe Ovation Automation Platform and Ovation Green portfolio of renewable solutions are purpose-built for power generation, greenfield build, and plant modernization applications. Together, our Ovation Automation Technology and Green solutions automate approximately 50% of North America and 20% of global power generation. Emerson's strategic project funnel in power is up 45% year-over-year, reflecting the emerging potential, and I'd like to mention a key win from the quarter. Emerson was selected by a large Midwest utility to modernize nine sites with the latest Ovation hardware, software, and cybersecurity solutions.\nWe were awarded based on our demonstrated ability to execute plant modernizations while ensuring safety, quality, and reliability, all vital important in the power industry. With the increasing mix of generation sources and rise of distributed resources and microgrids, utilities must now also manage the integration of varying and bidirectional power flows. AspenTech's Digital Grid Management, or DGM, software also plays a critical role in managing the ever-increasing complexity of today's grid to maintain stability and control through real-time power management and demand-side management software.\nDGM is a strong participant in these markets, with approximately 40% share in North America and approximately 20% globally. The necessity of grid digitalization is driving investments in the advanced capabilities this software provides, with the market forecasted to grow in the high teens. Emerson's leading products and application expertise across the power landscape make us well-positioned to capture the coming investments, both in the US and globally, and we are excited to watch the future of power generation, transmission, and distribution unfold. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide eight to discuss our Q2 financial results. Underlying sales growth was 8%, led by our process and hybrid businesses. Price contributed approximately three points of growth, slightly higher than expected due to the mix of our shipments this quarter. Growth was led by Europe, which was up 12%, and Asia, Middle East, and Africa, up 11%. The Americas also had solid growth, up 4%. Intelligent devices and software and control grew by 6% and 14%, respectively.\nAspenTech sales increased significantly over the prior year, up 21% on an underlying basis. Discrete automation was down mid-single digits, as expected, due to continued market softness and against a tough prior year comp. Test and measurement, which is not included in the underlying measure, contributed $367 million to our net sales, exceeding expectations for the quarter on stronger backlog conversion. Backlog was essentially flat to the prior quarter at $7.55 billion.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 26%, and as Lal mentioned, gross profit margins of 52.2% contributed to this margin expansion. Leverage on volume, favorable mix, price, net material deflation, and productivity programs all contributed to the margin improvement. Operating leverage, excluding test and measurement, was 54%, exceeding expectations. Test and measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.4%, above expectations driven by leverage on slightly higher sales volume, mix, and higher cost actions. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.36, and I will discuss additional details on adjusted EPS on the next chart.\nLastly, free cash flow improved 32% to $675 million, exceeding expectations driven by earnings and improved inventory levels. Acquisition-related costs, integration activities, and higher CapEx reduced the quarter's free cash flow by approximately $70 million. Please turn to slide nine. Adjusted EPS growth of $0.27 was driven entirely by operations, as other non-operating items netted to zero. Software and control led the growth, contributing $0.18, and intelligent devices contributed $0.09. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 25% year-on-year to $1.36.\nPlease turn to slide 10 for details on our updated guidance for Q3 in 2024. Underlying sales are now expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5%, which raises the bottom of our February range. Our process and hybrid businesses are performing well and support the outlook for the rest of the year. We still expect underlying sales of our discrete automation segment to turn positive in Q4, and we are watching the orders progression, which we believe is now delayed by Q1.\nReported net sales growth is expected to be 15% to 16%, with Test and Measurement contributing approximately 10 points of growth, or approximately $1.5 billion in sales, the low end of the February guide, offset by a half-point drag from FX. Incremental margins are held at low to mid-40s, which suggest mid-30s incrementals for the second half. The second half will see a change in mix with higher project-related shipments and changes in segment and geographic mix. Adjusted EPS has increased to $5.40 to $5.50. Test and Measurement is still expected to contribute 40% to 45% as we accelerate synergy activities.\nWe now expect to have $100 million of synergies realized this year. AspenTech lowered their guidance yesterday afternoon, and we have incorporated the latest revisions into our guide. We now expect AspenTech to deliver 30% to 32% for the year versus the 32% to 34% in our February guidance. Free cash flow performance in the first half of the year and our updated earnings projections support free cash flow for the year of approximately $2.7 billion. Share repurchase, dividend, and tax rate expectations are unchanged from February.\nFor Q3, we expect underlying sales growth between 3% and 4.5% and leverage in the mid-30s due to the project and geographic mix I described earlier. Adjusted earnings per share is expected at $1.38 to 1.42. And finally, test and measurement sales and earnings per share contribution is expected to be at similar levels we saw in Q2 as we watch orders carefully. Our first half performance exceeded expectations, and we are excited to continue delivering strong results.\nOur transform portfolio is meaningfully improved with higher profitability driven by gross profit margins above 50% and higher organic sales growth driven by secular trends, and our Emerson management system continues to drive operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it over to the Q&A portion of our call.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question is from Scott Davis, Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Lal, Mike, Rob, and Colleen.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nA lot of good detail in the slides, but I wanted to start with just a sense of the synergies that you're seeing and just get a little bit more color on what you're seeing, what you're getting as far as structural cost out, what may have to come back when revenues recover, and how we might think about what really that asset looks like in kind of a more normalized situation from a profit perspective?.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Scott, I'll say a few words and let Ram add some color to this. First and foremost, we're very excited about the company. It's a far better company than we expected in terms of the quality of people, the quality of the technology, the loyalty of the customer base, and the opportunity to grow and expand as a leader in the industry. So we're very pleased.\nWe have a great management team in place, and what we're most pleased about is the responsiveness of that management team to the market conditions. This is now being run as an Emerson company, and they've gotten ahead of the activities around cost takeout in a very diligent way. This was all laid out prior to close with the teams. So we're essentially working down a playbook. We now moved into some of the actions, as I referenced, that were outlined for 2025 that have been moved forward. But none of these are elements that we believe we necessarily have to add back. This is really driving around efficiency in the company and positioning it to the SG&A structure to be more competitive, a little leaner on a go-forward basis. Ram, if you don't mind.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah, and just to add to that, I think the balanced approach around G&A, the optimization of the go-to-market, optimizing and focusing the R&D efforts on critical growth factors that are going to pay a lot of benefit for us as the market recovers. And that's really what we've been focused on. Obviously, we are seeing opportunities in logistics and supply chain, which is additional to what we had originally planned.\nBut net-net, the $185 million we've committed to is a programmatic approach that is divided across these four segments, and we've been able to accelerate these actions just given the environment we're in, mostly because these were all well planned out, and we are able to pull forward these initiatives given that they've been thought out and the teams are actioning them at a rapid pace.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah, that's helpful. Hey, guys, I'm looking at slide seven at the DGM and the Ovation, and give us a sense of how this upgrade cycle works. The power demand, obviously, and grid, I think we're all quite aware of what's going on there. But does it require, and I mean, maybe just a little bit more color on how these two DGM and Ovation do they integrate? Do they sell together? Is there any way to kind of get more benefit, I guess, from having the two assets versus the one? And it's a little bit of an open-ended question. I'm just trying to get a sense of the materiality and the upgrade cycle here. But maybe the best way to start with that is just to understand if those assets actually can integrate and work together and if that's a benefit to the utility?. Thanks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'll certainly be happy to comment. I think there's three very important elements. I think the element of materiality relates to the high growth in the outlook of projects and activity. We saw that 45% expansion in the funnel. We haven't seen that level of activity in power generation in a long time, with a positive growth in North America, again, driven by the data center demand that we outlined.\nSecondly, inside of the generation capacity, there certainly are opportunities for optimization software. That is an area that really is untapped, and that's a synergy opportunity that exists between Ovation and AspenTech. And then thirdly, certainly the leverage of a strength in our utilities, the customer base, takes us outside the walls of the plants into the transmission distribution.\nAnd even though there are not technology synergies between DGM and Ovation per se, there certainly are significant customer synergies and credibility that has been built with Ovation that takes us into the transmission distribution software.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nVery helpful. Thank you. Best of luck this year for the rest of the year.\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nCrosstalk\n\nThanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Nigel of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nMD, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question, guys. Good morning.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, Good morning, Nigel.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nMD, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. So I just wanted to dig into the operating leverage assumptions in the back half of the year. I think you said mid-30s on sort of mix changing. I think we've had this MRO mix now of 65% or so for the last couple of years. Are we starting to see that mix changing notably in the back half, maybe getting towards maybe, I don't know, 60% MRO?. Do you expect this to continue in 2025? It feels like it should be, but do you think 2025 is more like a mid-30s, or do you still think you can maintain 40% plus operating leverage in 2025?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCEO, Emerson\n\nYes, Nigel, it's Mike. As we look to the back half of the year, the mix change is meaningful, and you're correct. We've been at the 65% MRO, which is about where we were for the Q2 as well. That is going to drift down on us as we go into the second half. We also benefited this past quarter quite a bit from price. We'll continue to get the roughly 2% price, but it won't be the 3% we don't believe that we saw in the last quarter. Those are the big things.\nThere's also a geographic mix element to this, with the US growth moderating relative to other geographies. Then if you start to think about the 54% that we printed this quarter versus what we're expecting in the Q1, there was an uplift this quarter from AspenTech, which had a great quarter that will moderate in the back half of the year. So you need to put that into your thinking as you go forward as well.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nMD, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. I'm guessing it'll come within 25, but if you do think that continues, I appreciate that comment. But on National Instruments, it just feels like, so just to paraphrase the way you're setting this up for the second half, Q3 looks pretty flat sequentially on sales, call it 360-ish of sales, and then we're picking up towards 400 in the Q4.\nI just want to verify that pickup in the Q4 is entirely seasonal. I think when you go back in time, we typically see that coming through in that quarter. So it doesn't feel like we're taking a huge cycle call there. And then with the synergies, do we expect the margins to continue to move higher sequentially through the back half of the year?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCEO, Emerson\n\nYes. I think you summarized it well. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Sequentially, the margins will be up. Correct. And just to answer your 2025 question, I mean, it's early for us to plan 2025, but at the end of the day, we don't expect leverage rates in 2025 to be materially different from what we're going to deliver in 2024.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nMD, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's great. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nWell, I know you're still expecting mid-single-digit growth in the second half after the negative 1% in Q2. So maybe you could discuss how you started off Q3 in April, give us a little more color into visibility regarding that mid-single-digit growth in the second half. Do you have visibility in the process and hybrid staying at that mid-single-digit level? And then is the mid-single-digit organic growth kind of weighted to Q4, given the turn in discrete then?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, certainly, Andy. Look, we're off to a good start in Q3. April over April of last year is a double-digit 10% on orders. Certainly, end of three months is turned positive as well. So we flipped that to the low single digits on the three-month basis, trailing three-month basis. So feel good about the start, feel good about the funnel, the conversion, and the markets. and it's, again, driven by the process and hybrid environment across most of the world areas. Discrete, we're watching very carefully.\nAs we said, we expect that to turn now a quarter later than originally expected, but we're seeing green shoots that started developing in March and into April, particularly in Western Europe, in Germany, around machine makers and some of the discrete industries. So, optimistic start for the quarter. Again, gave us the confidence as we tested our businesses and worked out process that exiting the year in that mid-single digit, low single digit type of range on orders is very, very feasible.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nWell, just a quick follow-up to that last comment. Did you just get a couple of larger projects in April? Is that kind of what happened to swing that?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNope. Nope. No, there's funnel conversion, Andy, but nothing exemplary there.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay, And then maybe what are your customers telling you on the NI side as to sort of why the recovery is so delayed there? And if NI is still slower to turn than you currently expect, do you still have more flexibility to sort of continue to push the envelope on integration cost out? And ultimately, I know Ram said you're still targeting the $185 million, but could you do more than that?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, certainly. Look, I think the team has a great set of ideas on their walls in terms of opportunities to drive efficiency and productivity in the business. But we believe that ultimately this is a growth business. And while we're doing this, we're driving investments in core technology programs so that we hit the ground running. We're working on customer demand. Both Ram and myself, alongside the management team at National Instruments, are well engaged with the customers.\nRam will actually speak at NI Connect in a couple of weeks along with RE2, which will be a pivotal moment for us and be a very successful event in Dallas, I believe, Ram, this year. So look, we're very excited about the potential in the business and this business turning positive in early 2025. Ram, a few words?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And I think to answer your specific question as it relates to customer, what are we hearing from customers? Certainly, segments like the defense segment of what they call aerospace defense and government segment, positive. I think we're going to get into easier comparisons. Frankly, April was also a very good month given the expectations for TNM, which was positive for us.\nI think really the only two segments we haven't seen the turn, which is why we believe it's at least one to Q2 delayed in TNM, semiconductors, and Asia. North America actually turned positive in April. Europe's turned positive. We feel good about the ADG segment, and we're cautiously optimistic about transportation. But the portfolio segment, particularly driven by Asia and then semiconductors, is where we still have to see recovery. We're watching that very carefully.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate all the color, guys.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nMD, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGood morning, Deane\n\nDeane Dray\n\nMD, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIt just came up a couple of times in the prepared remarks, and maybe just if you could walk us through what's different. But you said that there was better backlog conversion than expected. So is this on because of customer requests?\nThey want it earlier, that you were able to have better productivity, a throughput? Just how did that differ from what the original plan was on the backlog conversion?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So Deane, simplistically, responsive supply chains. Our supply chains continue to improve. Our plant output has continued to improve, particularly in our measurement solutions business. There was backlog conversion and test and measurement as well. So the simple answer is we overshipped what we thought we would in the quarter, primarily because our supply chains responded much better, and lead times are down to pre-COVID levels, which is a very good sign for us. It tells you.\nGo ahead. Sorry, Deane. Just to build on that a little bit relatedly, those being two higher GP businesses helps the profitability in the quarter as well.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nMD, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, It tells you how far we've progressed on supply chain normalization, where that wasn't the first thing I'm thinking that you were able to ship more. So that's all good news. Then just to follow up on the test and measurement, Natty, on the orders visibility, is there maybe some color on the demand and whether did you miss any orders? Was the demand out there and you missed orders, or is the demand not there? Are you engaged in any more selectivity? Just some color there would be helpful.\nNo, we did not miss any orders. I think orders came in as per expectations. I think the way we've actually baked in the plan is even if orders stay flat to slight sequential growth from what we did in Q2, given the easier comparisons, will improve in the second half and then go positive into 2025.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nCertainly, as Lowell mentioned, the green shoots in the defense part of their business, we've been very strong. We're starting to see projects unlock on the battery testing side from an EV perspective. So we're starting to see activity come through. Again, the one segment which hasn't seen the recovery, which typically we play in RF and mixed signal in semiconductors, the memory and the logic piece is not a big piece of our business. We expect that to come back first, followed by the activity in RF and mixed signal chip testing. So that recovery is really what's pushed out by six months. But outside of that, everything is coming in as expected.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nMD, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Tusa, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nSo I'm just trying to kind of calibrate the second half a little better. I think you guys typically, from a seasonal perspective, more or less accelerate sequentially as you move through the year. This year seems like it's a bit more kind of flat, just from a quarter-to-quarter sales perspective, and then with much less of a ramp from Q3 to Q4. Anything on the top line seasonally that is not as normal, is a little slower than usual on the core business outside of Natty and outside Aspen?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nNo, Steve. Actually, and the way I see it is our second half versus first half will be up high single digit sequentially from a sales perspective. So it is consistent with the normal seasonality of how our core business minus Natty minus Aspen performs. Now, obviously, Aspen is lumpy, and that's in the underlying number, so that could mask the normal seasonality that we see.\nBut in the core base Emerson operations, the second half, the first half is up high single digit sequentially from a sales perspective.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nAnd I guess given the mix of MROs so high today and the growth really isn't that strong, is the mix really changing that much? I mean, how much is the kind of lower margin project stuff going to be up in the second half more than MRO? You know what I mean? Can the mix change that much quarter to quarter?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, Steve, it doesn't. So look, we were at 65% in 2023. In Q2, we were at 64. So there was a point shift. That may move yet another point as we go through the year, but no, you're right. And the underlying strength of MRO in our process and hybrid business is still intact. and as we certainly go through the summer and approach the fall outages and STOs and turnaround opportunities, we look at that, at least from this point in time, rather positively as well.\nSo that's what's going to play into this as we go through the second half. And hence gives us confidence also on that exit rate on orders for the year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nAnd then just one last one on Natty. I haven't done the math on the Q3 guide, but is that down sequentially and then up sequentially in the Q4? It looks to me like the revenue run rate now, at least for the second half versus Q2, is basically flattish at around 370 or something like that. Is that the right construct for Natty in the second half?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nSo flat Q3, sequentially up in Q4.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nYeah. So it's bottomed. The revenue is at bottom there.\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nCrosstalk\n\nYep, Yep, Yep.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nMD, JP Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nMD, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGood morning, Joe.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nMD, Wells Fargo\n\nCan you dig in a little bit on the growth trends in measurement and analytical and final control? I mean, it seems like measurement and analytical organic, low double digits, maybe even touch low teens this year. Final control, mid-single digits. Just some of the differences in those growth rates, what you're seeing on the measurement side versus what you're seeing on the final control side?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nSo the measurement solutions this year, you're spot on. It's going to grow faster than final control, primarily because that was the business that suffered the most from a backlog build due to lead times. That backlog's coming down. So the delta in growth rates between final control and measurement solutions from a sales perspective is purely that backlog dynamic.\nOrder rates for both businesses, which is a signal of the underlying demand with both businesses being exposed to process hybrid markets, relatively the same mid- to high-single digits.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nMD, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Then it looks like on AspenTech, the Q4 EBITDA is implied down something in the neighborhood of kind of $20 million year-over-year. Is that more revenue-related, margin-related? Just to understand, kind of line of sight into that, if that's sort of ballpark what we're looking at?.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So ballpark, that's what we're looking at. It is lumpy given the ASC 606, and we'll continue to work the AspenTech Q4. But at this point, yeah, it's forecasted to be down from Q3.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nMD, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot\n\nOperator\n\n. The next question is from Brett Linzey, Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nMD, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Hey, wanted to come back to the Power franchise. So I imagine there's an opportunity on the new build, but also the retrofits on the installed basis. Some of these LTSAs expire with some of your peers out there. Is there a way to frame the content per unit or megawatt, and then any runway on some of the retrofits?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCEO, Emerson\n\nIt will give you some perspectives and some guidelines. On a 1,200-megawatt combined cycle plant, the project opportunity or KOB1 opportunity is approximately $20 million. It's $5 million in the control system, approximately $15 million of instrumentation and valves. The lifetime MRO opportunity over a decade is another $20 million of upgrades, and that lives through about a 10-year period. So it's very significant, and you can just calculate then off the megawatts depending on the size of the plant. So certainly, there are upgrade opportunities. That's a lot of what we're seeing in the revamps.\nWe see also on the nuclear side, extension of plant life, which is very meaningful for us, not just from an Ovation perspective with Westinghouse, but certainly from an instrumentation perspective and valve perspective. So all dynamics in the global power market are pointing very positive right now.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nMD, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Very helpful. And then just on inventory levels, I know your channel dynamics are a little bit different than peers, but maybe you could just frame where you see inventories in some of those channels. And specifically at machine builders, inventory levels I think are a bit elevated, but just curious what your assessment characterization is for the near term here.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYeah. For our discrete business, our discrete automation business, I think inventory levels are certainly normalized in the channel, so we see no dynamics around that.\nThe test and measurement business at NI. There is still some elevated levels of inventory in our portfolio business-related channel partners distribution that should bleed out over the next quarter, which will be helpful for order rates in the portfolio business to turn. But net-net, we don't see any major dynamics around channel inventory that would impact our orders momentum.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nMD, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Thanks for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, Good morning. Maybe just wanted to—\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nCrosstalk\n\nGood morning. Good morning. Good morning, Lal.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe just wanted to start off with the discrete automation business. Ram, you touched on the inventories at some of the customer levels just now being normal. So when we're thinking about your discrete business, is it in the Q3 sort of flattish sales, down a little bit year-on-year, and in the Q4 in discrete, you're up year-on-year and sequentially? Is that the recovery slope?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYes, sir. Yes. Quarter-over-quarter, flat in Q3, slightly positive in Q4 is kind of how we're looking at orders. So recovery in the Q4. Correct. And then for test and measurement, which is also exposed to the discrete markets, but a different type of discrete market exposure, recovery into H1 2025, primarily because of the heavy play in Semicon and a bigger portfolio business in China. Two of those markets are seeing slower recovery than our broader discrete automation business within the core Emerson.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. and maybe just on the AspenTech side of things, Lowell, you'd mentioned the CFO change and reiterated there's no big portfolio actions at Emerson this year. Maybe just characterize sort of with AspenTech in general how you're thinking about your discussions with them on their capital deployment plans. I've seen they've continued to do the share buybacks. And when you look a little bit further out beyond this year, the appetite on kind of software acquisitions, please.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, sure. No. First, continue to be very excited about the partnership that we have with AspenTech. I do believe, Julian, that together we have a highly differentiated tech stack that we bring to the customer base. And I think that's being highly substantiated by the synergy wins, the level of customer engagements that both Antonio and I have around the world.\nWe continue to believe in the premise that one plus one equals three here. In terms of the CFO, rightfully, I think you said it right. I'm excited from a perspective of the processes and structure that can be brought in. I think there'll be a really good working relationship between Antonio and David Baker. He brings a lot of the Emerson management system into AspenTech with him, which we believe is important from an operating perspective. Then lastly, look, no. No comment on going forward. We're going to operate the structure as is, keeping in mind, Julian, that we're only in the second year of this journey, and we believe that there's value to be created out there in the structure. So for now, no change.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question is from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThis is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Just wanted to circle back. I know that there was some pull forward of orders last quarter. How did that, if you kind of normalized Q1 and Q2 for that, what did that trend look like? And just to put a little finer point on it, should we be expecting low single-digit orders growth in Q3 before stepping up in Q4?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYes. So it's we were plus 4% in Q1, down 1% in Q2. So low single digits for the first half, greater than one book-to-bill. And then in the second half, you are right, low single digits in Q3. And arguably Q4, which is at this point baked in better than Q3. Let's put it that way.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGot it Then on the sustainability and decarbonization project funnel, I know that's nearly doubled over the last 18 months. Are these projects kind of getting closer and closer to final investment decisions, kind of like the carbon capture when you cited with Shell this quarter?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nEVP and COO, Emerson\n\nYes. I mean, in certain segments like biofuels and carbon capture, the hydrogen projects, which are large, are probably slower movement through the funnel. But I think we see considerable activity globally, certainly big in Europe, here in North America as well. But the pace of progression of these projects through the funnel is varied depending on the segment.\n\nDavid Ridley-Lane\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nVery much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management for any closing remarks.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nThanks so much for joining the call today, and we look forward to callbacks later this afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please, please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVice President Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on slide 2.This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO Lal Karsanbhai for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the Emerson team for delivering a strong start to 2024. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to the Emerson Board of Directors and to our customers for your continued confidence in us. Our first quarter results demonstrate the underlying strength of the markets we serve, the meaningfulness of our differentiated technology, and the relentless execution of our global teams. Please turn to Slide 3. Q1 was a strong start for Emerson as we continued our focus on executing and driving value creation for our shareholders.\nThe demand environment remains healthy for process and hybrid markets. We continue to see projects moving forward at a healthy pace in markets like chemical, LNG, life sciences, metals and mining, and sustainability and decarbonization. Even in the face of higher interest rates, ongoing geopolitical challenges, and upcoming elections in key global markets including the US. Our customers' 2024 CapEx budgets are shaping up constructively and are largely supportive of the demand environment we are experiencing. This robust environment along with continued execution by our teams is a key contributor to the Q1 performance.\nQ1 orders, sales, operating leverage, and adjusted earnings all exceeded expectations, providing confidence to increase our full year guidance. This performance reflects our ability to win with a focused approach to our growth platforms and through continued investments in innovation. It is also a testament to our new differentiated portfolio with leading technology, strong profit margins, and exposure to the important global secular growth markets. This is exhibited by our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA expansion since 2021. Our business is well positioned to capture investments in areas like energy security and affordability, sustainability and decarbonization,\ndigital transformation, and nearshoring. Regarding our portfolio, we continue to reiterate that the large parts of our portfolio transformation are complete and we do not expect any sizable transactions in 2024. This is the portfolio we designed from the beginning and we are excited to be executing with this set of businesses. On that note, Test and Measurement is executing well and had a strong first quarter ahead of our expectations. The quarter performance and an acceleration of synergies provide more confidence for our full year expectations from the business. Please turn to Slide 4. Emerson's Q1 exceeded all expectations.\nUnderlying orders continued to grow in the mid single digit range with 4% growth in Q1. Process and hybrid markets were strong and Discrete orders remained down as expected. Multiple LNG projects booked in the quarter, specifically in Europe and the Middle East. Life sciences activity was also strong across the globe with large project wins in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. The Q1 growth was also supported by some project activity shifting from Q2 to Q1. As you all know, orders can move around quarter to quarter, but we still expect low single-digit order growth in the first half of 2024 and mid single-digit order growth for the full year\nas Discrete demand improves in the second half. Underlying sales for the quarter grew 10% again led by Process and Hybrid Markets exceeding our expectations. Energy Transition Markets and Metals and Mining were both bright spots in the quarter as we executed numerous projects across Europe, Latin America, and Australia. This volume, combined with favorable price cost and a strong operational execution, resulted in 41% operating leverage in Q1 ahead of our mid-30s expectations. Adjusted EPS was $22, up 56% versus 2023, and free cash flow was $367 million, up 51%. Mike Baughman will go through the specifics shortly,\nbut we are excited about our first quarter performance. On Slide 5. Our current strategic project funnel grew by approximately $200 million to $10.4 billion and our growth programs continue to represent nearly 2/3 of this funnel. The continued expansion of the funnel is promising with existing customers and new entrants continuing to plan and budget for capital projects in the coming years. In the first quarter, Emerson was awarded approximately $400 million of project content with a little more than half from our growth programs, including three noteworthy deals in energy transition.\nFirst, Emerson was selected by DG Fuels in Louisiana to provide our comprehensive automation portfolio including advanced sensing, control systems, and optimization software for the production of sustainable aviation fuels. These fuels can be used in existing aviation and vehicle engines and DG Fuels has previously announced agreements with aviation leaders including Air France, KLM, Delta, and Airbus. Next, Emerson was chosen to automate a lithium-ion recycling process based on our metals and mining expertise and experience throughout the lithium value chain.\nEmerson will provide SungEel HiTech, a specialist in lithium battery recycling in Korea, with advanced automation solutions for safe and reliable operations at its newest facility that is capable of supplying materials for approximately 400,000. Electric vehicles each year. Lastly, Emerson and AspenTech were jointly selected for a large scale LNG liquefaction facility in the Middle East. The project win represents Emerson's strong presence in the region, including an already sizable LNG installed base. The win is also recognition of the collaboration and synergies between Emerson and AspenTech as Emerson's DeltaV was\nselected along with AspenTech's HYSYS simulation showing the power and differentiation of our combined portfolio. As we look at the continued needs of Europe and its reliance on gas imports, the Middle East and Africa will play a pivotal role in gas exports. Emerson is uniquely positioned with our local expertise, manufacturing, and installed base to serve the region and its LNG growth. These are just three examples of Emerson's continued leadership position in energy transition markets, spanning from established markets like LNG to newer markets like sustainable aviation fuels. Turning to slide six, we remain focused on accelerating innovation for profitable growth.\nOur recent innovations and our continued technology leadership were recognized by IoT Breakthrough, who named Emerson its 2024 Industrial IoT Company of the Year. IoT Breakthrough received over 4,300 nominations for the 2024 competition, and Emerson was selected based on our unique ability to effectively leverage decades of expertise in digitalization and automation to help the industry transform operations. Among the innovations recognized were Emerson's Ovation Green portfolio for managing renewable power assets, Floor to Cloud solutions to continuously monitor critical production and energy efficiency data in factories,\nOne-Click Transfer software capable of accelerating the life sciences drug development process, and numerous releases focused on enabling the Boundless Automation vision, including the DeltaV Edge environment. As you recall, Boundless Automation is Emerson's vision for a cohesive automation ecosystem from device to enterprise. Integrating operations with a flexible automation architecture allows users to have access to all their data, enabling analytics and performance improvements across numerous domains like production safety, reliability, and sustainability. All these innovations will be on display at Emerson's upcoming Emerson Exchange.\nAt the end of February, Emerson Exchange in Düsseldorf, Germany will feature customer case studies, industry sessions, and a technology exhibit demonstrating Emerson's leading automation portfolio for process and hybrid industries. New this year are industry focused exhibits showcasing Emerson's complete solutions for emerging industries like hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture, in addition to growth markets like life sciences, metals, and mining. Please turn to Slide 7 for an update on our synergy progress in Test and Measurement. We effectively use the time between signing and closing to plan all integration and synergy activities\nutilizing a world-class M&A methodology as part of our Emerson Management System. Given the strong team collaboration and current market environment, we have accelerated those synergy activities. In Q1 we worked closely with the new Test and Measurement leadership team to aggressively address public, company, and corporate costs while rapidly implementing phase I of our sales and marketing and research and development transformations. We are also leveraging our Emerson Management System and best practices to progress operational execution and commercial excellence at Test and Measurement.\nThis includes trade working capital, price realization, and procurement efficiencies in logistics and direct materials. These efforts put Test and Measurement ahead of schedule and give us the confidence to increase the cost synergy target to $185 million, which we now expect to achieve by the end of 2026, two years faster than originally expected. This includes approximately $80 million expected to be realized in 2024. Our planned cost to achieve these synergies increases slightly to $165 million with the majority of the spend expected in the first two years. We still expect adjusted segment EBITDA to reach approximately 31% by year five as sales grow on the reset cost base.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman to go through more detail on the quarter performance including Test and Measurement and our updated 2024 guide.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks Lal and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 where we have summarized our first quarter financial results. Underlying sales growth was 10%, led by our process and hybrid businesses. Intelligent Devices and Software and Control grew 11% and 9% respectively. Discrete Automation was down low single digits as expected. All world areas were strong with Asia, the Middle East, and Africa up 15%, Europe up 10%, and the Americas up 8%. Price contributed approximately 2 points of growth. Test and Measurement, which is outside of the underlying sales measure, contributed $392 million, exceeding expectations for the quarter.\nI will discuss Test and Measurement performance in more detail on the next slide. Backlog is now $7.6 billion, which is up $500 million versus September 30th. When excluding Test and Measurement, Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 190 basis points to 24.6%. Volume margin, accretive price cost, which included net material deflation, ongoing productivity programs, and the Test and Measurement performance all contributed to the margin improvement. Operating leverage excluding Test and Measurement was 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 56% to $1.22, up $0.44, and is a strong start to the year.\nDouble digit sales growth and 41% operating leverage contributed to the $0.33 of operational improvement year over year. Non operating items contributed $0.11 year on year, mainly due to lower stock compensation, which contributed $0.08 versus Q1 of 2023. As a reminder, all legacy mark to market stock compensation plans are now complete. Also contributing to the non-operating items were interest income of 4%, and share count which contributed $0.02. Tax was a $0.03 headwind. Lastly, free cash flow for the quarter of $367 million was up 51% versus the prior year.\nThis was in line with our expectations for the quarter as we saw modest improvement in working capital year on year. Headwinds related to acquisition fees and restructuring impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million, and CapEx was up $18 million year on year. AspenTech sales in ACV were slightly weaker than our expectations for Q1, driven mainly by a delay in renewal from one customer. This slight miss, however, did not have a material impact on total Emerson results versus our expectations for the quarter. ACV grew close to 10%, and the AspenTech team continues to see strong market dynamics in power, transmission, and distribution, and sustainability and\ndecarbonization, while at the same time utilizing Emerson relationships to win an LNG, life sciences, and power generation. Turning to slide 9, we will dive deeper into Q1. Performance of Test and Measurement orders were in line with expectations, down 17% year over year, but showed high single-digit sequential improvement led by the strength in aerospace. There was continued softness in semiconductor and automotive markets, and ongoing weakness in China. We continue to launch orders as a key indicator and still expect a turn in H2 on easier comps. Sales for the quarter were $382 million, beating initial expectations.\nThis was driven by stronger backlog conversion, lower than expected sales during the 11-day stub period prior to closing, and a little conservatism in the guide given the timing of the close. Sales were $401 million including the sales in the stub period. Test and Measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 26.5% in the quarter, beating expectations due to higher sales, better than expected gross margins, and slightly higher cost synergies. The Q1 adjusted segment EBITDA margin benefited from lower than expected sales in the stub period against ratable fixed costs.\nTest and Measurement contributed $0.13 in the first quarter including stock compensation expense and using the Test and Measurement tax rate which is in the mid teens. The stub period dynamic discussed earlier benefited the adjusted EPS contribution by approximately $0.02. Test and Measurement's March quarter end sales volume has typically stepped down from its December quarter end. We expect similar seasonality with second quarter sales of approximately $350 million. Second quarter adjusted EPS contribution is expected to be $0.07, driven by leverage on the lower seasonal sales volume partially offset by synergy savings.\nTurning to the full year, we have increased our expected adjusted EPS contribution from Test and Measurement to $0.40 to $0.45 to account for some of the Q1 upside. We still expect sales to be $1.5 to 1.6 billion as we continue to watch for the orders turn. Sales volumes are expected to ramp from Q2 to Q4, turning positive in Q4 consistent with our prior expectations. While we expect sales to be down versus 2023. We expect modest adjusted EBITDA expansion as we recognize the cost synergies. Finally, I would like to thank the Test and Measurement team for an excellent quarter.\nThe integration work has been performed exceedingly well, and your embrace of the Emerson Management System is very much appreciated. Thank you again to the entire Test and Measurement team. Please turn to Slide 10 for details of our Q2 and full-year 2024 guidance. After our strong Q1 performance, we are increasing our full-year 2024 sales and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect underlying sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% driven by our process and hybrid businesses. We expect both Intelligent Devices and Software and Control to be within this guidance range for underlying sales.\nWe continue to watch the Discrete Automation recovery closely, and we now expect sales to turn positive in Q4 consistent with Test and Measurement. Full-year Discrete Automation underlying sales are now expected to be down in the low single-digit range. FX is expected to be approximately flat versus 2023 compared to a 1-point headwind embedded in our November guidance. Operating leverage excluding Test and Measurement is now expected to be in the low to mid-40s in 2024 versus the mid to high-40s guidance from November. A modest reduction in our full yeartarget is solely attributed to the move in FX as the 1% increase in sales volume comes in at a lower margin.\nOur adjusted EPS range increases from $5.30 to $5.45 driven by our Q1 performance. AspenTech is still expected to contribute approximately $0.32 to $0.34. Lastly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $2.6 to 2.7 billion. Share repurchase is expected to be approximately $500 million, of which $175 million was completed in Q1. For the second quarter, we expect underlying sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5% with leverage in the low to mid-40s. Tougher comps and Discrete automation are expected to have an impact on reported sales growth for the quarter. However, volumes are expected to improve sequentially from Q1.\nAdjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.22 and $1.26, and with that we will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time I'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster.\nThe first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nLal, I think your backlog at $7.6 billion was up relatively significantly even excluding the test and measurement addition with the orders as you said at 4%. Can you talk about organic order visibility going forward? It seems like process hybrid been relatively strong as you thought. Can you sustain that mid single digit kind of order growth going forward? And then have you seen an inflection yet in nat gas related orders?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYes, Andy. No, happy to give you some color on the orders. So obviously. As you know about our business, orders can fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which is why we guided in that lower single-digit range in the first half of the year. But finishing the year in the mid-single-digit range as we are now, we have a high degree of confidence about that based on two factors, Andy. The first being our MRO business continues to be relatively strong. It represented approximately 65% of the revenue in Q1, and we expect that to remain robust as we go through the remainder of the year.\nAnd that provides us a strong base of order activity. Secondly, the conversion in the funnel we booked approximately $400 million. That represented almost a little over 90 projects that we won out of the funnel in the first quarter. The funnel grew despite that and we continue to see activity, particularly in energy transition driven by the Middle East and Africa, in the sustainability area, life sciences, and of course a tremendous amount of activity in metals and mining. So, from an underlying Emerson perspective, the focus really is process and hybrid to continue to provide that underlying strength through the year.\nNow, what we will see is a recovery in Discrete in the second half, and that's what we've got baked in here. We are still in the lower single digits negative right now in our Discrete markets; it's really demand driven as we've been talking about for the last couple quarters. But we do expect a recovery in orders into the second half, of course, between comps and obviously some demand elements there. As far as NI is concerned, very much on plan to what we expect in terms of orders. We do also believe that there's a second half. Positive return on the order activity, and we're starting to see early signs in markets,\nparticularly like semiconductor, as you've seen these companies come out and report, so very much on plan on both ends, which gives us confidence in the underlying strength of the order activity.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAndy, helpful. You obviously had a good quarter and raised the outlook, but maybe just on free cash flow, you didn't change your guidance despite the better quarter and outlook. Did you raise your acquisition-related costs? Is CapEx going up? Anything that you could talk about on that side or on the working capital side?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nHey Andy, it's Mike. I'll take that one. Yeah, the guide was maintained at $2.6 to $2.7, and with respect to the $250 million that we called out in November, that's tracking right on plan, about $100 million in the quarter plus the cap that's on the operating cash flow items, mostly integration related. And then we did see a little bit elevated CapEx, again very much in line with expectations. We thought a lot about the guide obviously, and just to go through a little bit of the math, while we took up the earnings, we took up the sales. The net of that is about $50 million in cash flow, still within the $2.6 to $2.7.\nSo, we elected not to take it up given where we sit first quarter, but certainly sitting here today, I can tell you we feel better about the cash flow guide than we did three months ago, and it's all going to plan.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThat's great. Appreciate the color guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nMorning, Steve,\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\ncan you just talk about the bridge? A little more clarity there. From the $0.13 you did for NI to the $0.07, it doesn't look like all of that amount is accounted for by $30 million sales decline. Then I guess just when you look out to this $1.55 billion guidance, going from what you've done in the first half, do we expect that to be kind of linear from the $350 million in Q2 in sales or is it kind of heavily loaded in Q4?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Steve, it's Mike. I'll talk a little bit about the Test and Measurement performance and the EPS performance in the quarter. We talked a little bit about this stub dynamic, which really was simply the early 11-day period that we didn't own them. The first part of the quarter, the sales were much lower than we expected. We expected something more ratable. They were not ratable. And that drove about $0.02 of improvement from what we expected. And the business leverages, as you know, really nicely. So pushing those sales out into the quarter drove part of that.\n$0.13 performance. Now, of that there was also some Q1 sales that we were expecting in Q2. And so when we thought about the guide, we took that $0.08 beat and we rolled $0.05 forward. That's where we landed. Great performance on test and measurement, and we're really off to a great start there. Ram, you want to talk about this second part of the question?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I think it's not all in Q4, so you'll see evenly distributed in Q3 and Q4. It will step up from the $3.50. We feel pretty good about the $0.40 to 0.45 as we sit here.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. Just one last one just on the discrete. You guys have been a little more steady on that Discrete performance. So, you're relative to some of your peers who had a very strong backlog liquidation in the H2 of last year. You guys kind of started to see some of that weakness or the comps start getting easier in the Q4, correct? The year over year comps.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, actually, in Q3, Q3 and Q4 should be good quarters for us from a Discrete perspective. Correct orders and then sales will turn.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nPositive in Q4, right.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOn an easier comp, correct? Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHello. Good morning everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGood morning. Hey, Lal. Two from me. First one just on LNG. Obviously it's a global business and you talked about the Middle East. But just give us your perspective on, you know, what the administration's done on approvals in the US and you know, how that might impact your business, the funnels, you know, and anything related on your mind?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, certainly we were disappointed with the administration's decision to hold permitting, export permitting regarding LNG, not just from an Emerson perspective, from an overall, as an American, to be very honest, but it is a global business where we have significant activity ongoing in Qatar, of course, in Mozambique, and in Guyana, which will provide ample activity and gives us confidence in the forecast that we have in the funnel movement. In terms of the projects we're executing in North America, we don't see any meaningful impact to 2024 at this point in time,\nAndy. The projects that we have won have the approvals required not just for construction, transportation, but ultimately for export. And our partners, Bechtel and others that we've discussed on these calls have given us the confidence, Jeff, that we are. Excuse me, that we are. That 2024 is relatively solid. Then as we go forward, we'll see. We continue to see accelerated strength in the east coast of Africa and in the Middle East, and there's some activity up in Canada as well. So we'll see where that goes related to the US decision.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nAnd then just to be totally clear, Lal, the project funnel that you illustrate for us quarterly, some of the non, you know, I guess pending approval US projects, are they in that funnel?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYes, they're in the funnel. Depending on the year that we had expectation, that funnel looks at about a three year lens of activity. So there are in the funnel there, and as you know, and the construction of a liquefaction plant. Excuse me, Jeff. A liquefaction plant is a four to five year event. So certain decisions will continue to be made based on assumptions of export licenses being awarded down the stretch, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nRight. And then just shifting on NI real quick. You know, certainly suspect that your synergies, you know, initially laid out were somewhat conservative. But I wonder if you could address the, you know, the three-year versus the five-year. So you know, kind of the underlying cost synergies. I'm not surprised they're going up. I think, you know, part of the reason though you talked about five years was really treading carefully on sales force, you know, R&D organization, that sort of thing. So just give us your thoughts on where that is and maybe the cultural side of the integration, I guess is the heart of the question.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nWell, I will start with this, Jeff. We have a phenomenal management team led by Ritu Favre and a great integration team here at Emerson that works very closely with the business. The team spent a significant amount of time between signing and close to do the work so that we could hit the ground running. But of course, as you can imagine, this is a very large transaction. And we bought this company because we believe it can grow and it can run better. We wanted to have a degree of caution in how fast we could go, what we could accomplish, and to many degrees, we've been pleased with the degree of execution,\nthe speed at which it's been done, and the energy that the team has had around the effort, which then gave us confidence not just to increase the number, but to increase the time of execution, to decrease the time of execution to three years. Ram, any color on that?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah, you said it. I think the team, as we both reviewed the plans, felt very, very good in the quality of the opportunities that we'd identified. And there's a shared vision around trying to get this done faster and moving the business along. And that's where we've been very pleasantly surprised. The cultural similarity between how we both think the customer centricity and how we apply the rules to these synergy actions. You know, I think there we feel very confident that we could move faster, and that's the reason we raised it. And we also believe we can get it done by the end of year three.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGreat. Good luck. Thanks.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. So, obviously, lots of questions on NI so far. National Instruments. I guess you've obviously accelerated the timeline for percentages. As Jeff mentioned, you've raised it by $20 million, but you kept the 31%.\nMargin targets. Just wondering if there's anything kind of offsetting the upside to cost synergies we should consider?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNigel, it's Mike. No, there's really on plan. And remember, that's five years out that we were talking about 31%. We are on track. I think the important thing for the near term is that our expectation around that adjusted EBITDA margin will be that it's a little bit up year over year on down sales, reflecting the synergy actions and moving forward. No, there's really no change to our longer term expectation around the profitability of Test and Measurement.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, no. But the $20 million gives you an extra point of margin. So just wondering if there's anything to offset that. It doesn't sound like there is, but just that's the spirit of the question.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThere isn't. I mean.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, go ahead.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo, there isn't. There isn't necessarily anything we've identified to offset the $20 million. I mean, the 31% more margin targets five years out. I mean, obviously what we are finding is good investment opportunities, and right now we're focused on executing the synergies by year three. If we find good investment opportunities, we'll make that because I think 31% is the target we've set, and we feel pretty comfortable getting there. But if the 185 comes through with no additional investment opportunities, maybe the number goes up. But that's a five year out number.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's fair enough. I know I'm bean counting, but it's worth a question. And then you had some extraordinarily strong growth numbers within ID, the 28% within measurement analytics. It looks like it's just an easy comp. Maybe just talk about that a little bit. But more importantly, there's this theory out there that the process and hybrid markets are on a path to Discrete and therefore this bloodbath we're seeing in Discrete Automation right now is sort of like a precursor for what you might see six months down the road. Can you just maybe address that point and just anything unusual or concerning that you're seeing?\nIt doesn't sound like it, but certainly just maybe address that concern out there.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, happy to. Nigel, I've been speaking and been asked about this for the last three quarters or so, and again what we experienced in the quarter continues to be very consistent with our initial commentary. The drivers around process and hybrid are being supported by the secular macros that we've been discussing, whether it's energy security, affordability, nearshoring, sustainability, or digital transformation. I think those macro secular drivers are robust enough and secular in nature that they will go through a different type of cycle that we've seen historically. Secondly, we did not experience a boom-and-bust environment in the process space over the last cycle.\nThis was a much moderated capital cycle that we experienced. So we don't have the overcapacity situations and the overbuilt situations that we have typically experienced.There was much more discipline in the capital outlays by our customers, and that's a benefit as well. Our business continues to be very robust. Obviously, we continue to have confidence in the order run and in the execution through the year.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, just to answer the first part of your question, measurement solutions up 28%. That's a function of the supply chains coming back in that business. If you remember, it was an easier comparison Q1 of last year. We had significant challenges on the electronics front which have alleviated. So orders are up high single digits, sales up 28% driven by improving supply chain. So it's clearly a data point driven by weaker, easier comparisons, I would say, with Q1 of last year. Great.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThat's great. Cut. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Congrats,\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood Morning Scott,\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\ncongrats on the good start.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI wanted to back up a little bit. You know, when you, when you talk about R&D transformation at Test and Measurement, what, what do you mean? Is it, is it like an 80/20 type thing that you're doing or refocusing or just. I know they're those good folks that NI always spent a lot of money, but was it generally unfocused, do you think, or how do you guys think about it?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I think it's purely on prioritization of the projects. I think we've gone in with our management system on how do we focus on the critical few priorities that can move the needle from a growth perspective. I mean, there's lots of opportunity. The beauty of what we're finding at NI is a culture of innovation. Plenty of opportunities across four very important market segments where we can move the needle, macros around those markets like EVs, ADAS, and semiconductors that are supportive of strong innovation. But I think we're bringing some discipline into how do we prioritize,\nhow do we look at where do these resources need to be in order to balance best cost capabilities, particularly in software versus Austin, for example I think these are prudent moves that will allow us to drive more innovation at a better cost from an R&D as a percent of sales.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI will just add Scott to that. I think a company like NI, with the market position it has in the space and the legitimacy of its technology, will always have a role in the research element of innovation. That's always going to be a responsibility that we have in the space to continue to move that needle forward. And we will by all means, as we do in all our businesses, continue that. But having viable commercial programs is important. And that's where parking some cars and investing heavily in the ones that we believe and management believes will ultimately result in customer success is really important.\nSo really good work and thoughtful work being done by the team here, led by Ram, of course, and are too helpful.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nContext, if we back up a little bit. Again, you know, you cited the SAF win with DG Fuels. What is the scope when you classify something like a win like that? Are you talking flow meters, valves, is there controls? Is it kind of across a full suite of offering, or is there more specific stuff that you target for those types of projects you would classify as a win?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, no, this was, if you think about the automation stack, this was pretty much across the entire stack. The final control elements, the muscle in the plant, the sensing elements that we use, both flow, pressure, level, and temperature, the DeltaV control system and then the analytics packages alongside it. So this was a holistic full package, 100% Emerson win, which really proved out the value of the portfolio and how it all comes together at a customer site.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHelpful. Thank you. Congrats. I'll pass on. Good luck this year.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks sir.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the discussion around sort of process investments by the large customers, particularly in the sort of oil and gas and energy worlds, because it does seem as if there's understandably a clear effort on their part to sort of shovel more of their cash to shareholders, whether they're governments in the Middle East or public shareholders in the West. So just wondered your thoughts Lal, on the kind of sustainability of that high single digit orders growth in process that you saw in Q1.\nShould we expect that to moderate over the next sort of 12 months or so and does that then pull the backlog down with it or the book to bill was so high that the backlog can still grow with moderating orders?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, you know it's a great question, Julian. I just returned from the Middle East where our team spent time in India and the Middle East. Our team spent time with significant customers in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and I can tell you that the environment's very robust. Predominantly around sustainability and energy transition, those two elements. I think there's enough demand-driven activity that will give us confidence in sustaining a mid-single-digit kind of exit rate on process, on the total company orders at the end of the year. So at this point. We've been thinking and analyzing this now for about 3/4 or so, but we haven't seen.\nAny kind of deceleration in the process, particularly in the spaces that you're asking about. As a matter of fact, we continue to see very disciplined CapEx spending, very intentional around core elements of automation that can differentiate production around reliability, efficiency, productivity, of course, and safety. That hasn't waned yet and we don't foresee that as we go through the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful, thank you. And then just a much more sort of near-term fiddly question just looking at the second quarter guide on slide 10? The EPS at the midpoint. Is going up maybe $0.02 sequentially from Q1 despite a decent revenue and volume increase sequentially. Partly that's the test and measurement earnings falling sequentially. But just wondered if there was anything else like in the base business channel changing in terms of mix or something like that as you move from sort of Q1 to Q2?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo, you hit it right with the test and measurement comment. And the leverage in the low to mid-40s coming through reflects no big change in mix or trajectory. So really nothing there on the Q2 guide.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I also wanted to ask, on National Instruments, you know, Q1 came in about $80 million above the guide, but you know, you guys are now talking to a full year of $1.5 to $1.6 billion. You know, all the commentary on the last call was $1.6 billion. So I guess, you know, why that range following the beat is it? Just a rounding error or is National Instruments maybe turning a little bit slower. Than you thought previously? Thank you.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVice President Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nYeah, Chris, you know, if you go back to the November guide, that range has remained consistent. I think it was just a rounded 1.6% that was being spoken about.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, thank you. And then I just want to ask on margins, you know, it's been a. Real bright spot for the company the last couple of years. You guys beat the incremental guide again here in Q1, but I believe the full year guide on the incrementals was lowered, I think from low to mid-40s. From mid to high, despite the Q1 beat. Is there anything there on mix or something that we should be aware of? Thank you.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Chris, in the comments we talked about the effect of foreign exchange. We changed the assumption there, and it had a 1 point increase on FX, which flows into the leverage number with a much lower profitability attached to it. The drivers around leverage remain the same with volume, leverage, and price cost. Then we continue to drive the Emerson management process with cost reductions to offset inflation. So, yeah, to answer your question specifically, the change in the guide was really solely attributed to that FX element.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, look, there's been a lot of focus on the progress you're making on the cost synergies front in National Instruments. Can we talk a bit about expectations for revenue synergies? It might be too early, but just timing and size and where it might come from. Is it cross selling? Are there new customers you've been opened up to? But just what's the expectation?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, I'll let Ram add a little bit of color, but certainly it's something that we're keenly working on. Obviously, the focus was on the commitment on cost, and we do believe alongside management that that had been and is an evident opportunity. Having said that. We are. I'm not going to suggest that we're three or maybe even six months away to come out publicly with some sales ideas, but we're certainly working on customer specific ideas on sales synergies. Ram and I and Ritu have held a number of customer meetings jointly and thinking through opportunities that we have across the Emerson portfolio as it comes in with NI. Ram.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYes. And just the two end markets are clearly going to be EV batteries, where on a holistic basis, where we play on the production automation and NI plays on the validation and test systems on the R&D side, and then similarly in semiconductors, two markets where I think there's enough customer overlap and a joint capability that provides meaningful value to our customers from R&D through validation through production, is where we will see the opportunities. We're working it. We're not ready yet to commit and. Quantify the sales synergies, but these are certainly in focus and we're working through the process.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Just second question. I joined a bit late, so I apologize if you've covered this on China. A lot of anxiety about the macro there. It doesn't look like your position in the areas like real estate that are having the most pressure, but just what are the expectations? What are the opportunities over the near term?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, you know, we grew high single digits in the quarter in China sales. We expect in that high mid to high single digits for the year. Our business continues to be relatively robust, again aligned.To those same macro secular drivers that we're seeing globally. It's no different in China. Perhaps the end markets are slightly different, specialty chemicals and a few other things. But our position is very strong. Our regionalization strategy has been very strong and we expect to continue to win in China as we go through the ramp. Anything.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYep, now you said it. I think in our core process hybrid business, power and chemical will drive the growth. I mean, obviously, what's not in the underlying numbers is Test and Measurement. Test and Measurement is consistent with discrete. Off to a tougher start in China, but expecting a second half recovery consistent with what we're seeing with the discrete business.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Joe.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nJust in terms of the remaining nine months of the year and the guide, obviously off to a strong start. But organically, any change in how you're thinking about that versus three months ago? It seems like not much change in what's implied in the organic growth rate. If anything, I think the math would suggest the margins could have ticked down a touch. But I just want to make sure: is the message that the last nine months of the year, no real change in kind of the organic side of the expectations?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, we remain very positive on the environment. Obviously we couple that with the strong execution by our teams. But in terms of the organic outlook, no change really.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. And then related to the strength in Measurement and Analytical. I understand some commentary on easier comps, but the stacks did improve sequentially. And so as it relates to supply chain, where are you on normalization? The orders up high single digits is a pretty encouraging number. Are you at a point now where there's still some pent-up backlog to ship out or do you view it as having gotten pretty close to more normalization at this point?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, the supply chains have normalized. So in terms of our ability to procure electronics and load factories and drive production out of factories, we feel that's normalized now. Certainly in the Measurement and Analytical business, there is some overdue backlog that will shift through Q2. The easier comparisons and our ability to ship that backlog is what drove the 28% in Q1. You'll see that in the Measurement and Analytical business, that's the last business normalizing from a supply chain perspective. But the demand environment for that business still remains very healthy with orders up in the high single digits.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brett Linzey of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you. Wanted to come back to the project funnel. I was hoping you might be able to give some color on the profitability of the growth platforms. And is there anything different or unique about the aftermarket or service attachments, rates, and the way those deals are structured in Emerson's wallet share? There's.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo, nothing really different. Look, the profitability certainly varies between MRO and project activity, but that's well known. I think you know that well. But in terms of the mix within the funnel, there's not really a significant difference between a growth platform and traditional project work there. Of course we have $150 billion installed base around the world. And with that, some of that is obtained through and managed through service contracts. A large portion of it where we have commitments for replacement and maintenance with many of our global customers and others are upgrades, activities, and things of that sort.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nOkay, great. Then just shifting to price cost. I think the original guide was about two points. You had two points in the quarter. Has the expectation changed at all for the year, and then any movement on material or nonmaterial inflation that is shifting expectations at all on the cost side?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson",
    "content2": "No. Price is two points in the quarter. Two points for the year if we feel good. No change there. In terms of our net material inflation, I think we're seeing continued opportunities that we're driving. On the direct material side. The logistics costs have come down. We don't see any impact in terms of inflation, or it's de minimis, from the dynamics around what's going on in the Red Sea or the Panama Canal. So we see NMI or net material inflation continuing to improve as we go through the year.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nOkay, great. Appreciate the insight. Best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning. 2023 was an exceptional year for Emerson. The management team, alongside the board of directors, boldly delivered across the three dimensions of our value-creation strategy. Firstly, culture. Our management team just completed a trip around the world where we had the opportunity to engage with our customers and our teams. It was an energizing trip, and it was evident to me that the changes we are driving in the culture of Emerson are embraced, as evidenced by our engagement survey. 2023 was an important year. We made significant progress across multiple dimensions of culture.\nWe rolled out an employee value proposition, advanced our diversity-and-inclusion metrics, and made significant strides in our sustainability targets, as well as launching a differentiated talent engine program. Second, our portfolio transformation is largely complete. The Copeland divestiture, and more importantly, the acquisition of NI, have enabled us to create an Emerson focused on automation with a cohesive, higher growth, higher profit margin, diversified portfolio aligned to the critical macro-secular drivers: energy security and affordability, nearshoring, sustainability and decarbonization, and digital transformation.\nI would like to welcome Ritu Favre and the NI family to Emerson. This is an exciting time. With NI, our technology stack is unequaled, and we are in position to continue to push the boundaries of automation to meet our customers' needs. Thirdly, execution. The Emerson management system is delivering differentiated results. Underlying sales for 2023 grew 10%. GP expanded 330 basis points to 49%. And adjusted-segment EBITDA expanded 220 basis points to 25% after delivering yet another year of over 50% leverage. Adjusted earnings per share in 2023 grew 22% to $4.44, and free cash flow was $2.4 billion.\nOrders growth exited the year at 5%, and we grew across all world areas. We have strong price realization in the business at 4% for the year, and MRO represents 65% of our revenue, with now a $150 billion Installed Base around the world. We exited the year with $6.6 billion of backlog, up 12% year-over-year. We delivered on innovation in 2023. It was a year of significant releases in our DeltaV platform, Aspen models, and intelligent devices. Our R&D spend as a percent of sales rose to 7% in 2023. Cost management is a way of life at Emerson. The differentiated leverage of 53% is reflective of aggressive cost actions across our business.\nWe also delivered on commitments of no stranded costs related to the Copeland transaction, and we'll be delivering on the $100 million corporate cost takeout by the end of 2024 through significant transformational activities, driving certain functional activities to centralization and best-cost locations. I am humbled by the exactness of our performance, and I'm certainly optimistic about the future of our company. I'd like to express my appreciation to our customers who increasingly place their trust in Emerson to solve the world's most challenging problems.\nAnd lastly, in my opening remarks, I'd like to say I am but one of over 70,000 Emerson team members around the world. I'd like to thank our global employees for your passion, hard work, and energy that you bring to Emerson every single day. Please turn to slide three. As I said earlier, and it bears repeating, 2023 was an exceptional year. We are excited to run this cohesive, high-growth, and diversified portfolio. The financial performance was differentiated with double-digit underlying sales growth, 53% operating leverage, and 22% adjusted EPS growth.\nAs we look ahead, 2024 is expected to be another strong year. Operating leverage, excluding NI, is expected to be in the mid-to-high 40%s, and adjusted EPS is expected to be $5.15 to 5.35, including roughly $0.35 to 0.40 contribution from NI. We hit the ground running on 11 October 2023, as soon as we close the transaction, to begin executing the Synergy plan, and we expect it to provide early benefits in 2024. We are expecting 4% to 6% underlying sales growth, driven by our focus and commitment to winning in our growth platforms and leveraging our innovation.\nEnergy transition, industrial software, life sciences, and metals and mining are expected to remain resilient parts of our portfolio, and we are utilizing our leading technology, customer relationships, Installed Base, and expertise to capture investments in these markets. While Discrete markets are down in both our Factory Automation business and Test & Measurement, we are expecting recovery in the second half of the year. Turning to slide four for some additional details on how we finished the year.\n2023 was a remarkable operational year for Emerson. Starting with the orders performance, our teams executed exceptionally throughout the year. We won in the marketplace. We won in markets like LNG, hydrogen, renewables, life sciences, and metals and mining, resulting in 5% orders growth for the year. This shows our portfolio relevance and leadership position for our customers. Orders were also up 5% in Q4, led by double-digit order growth in China and the rest of Asia. Underlying sales were up double digits for the year, exceeding our initial expectation of 6.5% to 8.5% last November, and in line with our August 2023 guidance.\nThe strength was widespread across the organization, with all world areas growing 9% to 10% and both business groups growing 10%. I am most proud of our performance around operating leverage this year. 53% is differentiated. It is a testament to our Emerson management system and our operational talent, which drove strong performance. Adjusted EPS ended the year at $4.44, beating the midpoint of our original November 2023 guidance by $0.37 and near the top of our August 2023 guidance. Lastly, free cash flow of $2.4 billion was up 35% year-over-year and above our August 2023 guidance.\nTurning to slide five, our 2023 performance caps three strong years of execution, demonstrating the power of our Emerson management system and its ability to create value for our shareholders. We embarked on a transformational journey of Emerson in 2021 and remained focused on execution. Underlying sales growth of 7% and 10% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, shows the leadership position of our automation technology and our world-class sales organization. It is also indicative of our market-share expansion within the $160 billion served automation market.\nOur ability to both leverage our $150 billion Installed Base, as evidenced by our MRO sales in 2023 of 65%, and win new projects are strengths of this company and critical to the long-term success of this business. As we invest more in digital technology and software, we are also seeing the benefits to gross margins, which have expanded 470 basis points to 49% since 2021. Strong price discipline and differentiated technology have also provided positive contributions, and the addition of NI will further expand our gross margins. This enabled strong operational leverage across the business. Over 50% leverage for 2022 and 2023 is distinguished amongst industrials.\nCost discipline remains part of the DNA at Emerson, driving further cost productivity and margin expansion. Put all this together, and Emerson has delivered back-to-back years of +20% EPS growth. Please turn to slide six. I want to provide a couple of strategic updates on our business. In October 2023, we hosted Emerson Exchange Immerse in Anaheim, California. The event showcased our control systems and software technology and highlighted our integration with AspenTech throughout different solutions and industries.\nFeaturing over 1,400 attendees and over 100 customer presentations, the week was spent discussing the exciting roadmap of our DeltaV, Ovation, and AspenTech products and working with customers to solve their toughest challenges. This was all reflected in our keynote presentations from three important customers: Syzygy, a provider of electric catalyst reactor technology, Biogen, and Tesla, who discussed their automation challenges and partnership with Emerson. These types of engagements not only help our users' understanding of our current products, but also provide important inputs into our next-generation products and innovation.\nThroughout this event, we highlighted our Boundless Automation vision, the next-generation automation architecture that Emerson is uniquely positioned to deliver based on our leadership position in intelligent devices, control systems, and software. This vision empowers our customers to unlock and access all their operational data, enabling better decisions through analytics and optimization. It also enables customers to balance their production and sustainability goals through enterprise management and a unified software platform.\nOn slide seven, as part of this vision, we continue to accelerate innovation across four priority domains: disruptive measurement technologies, software-defined automation systems, self-optimizing asset software, and our sustainability portfolio. Each of these areas provides stepping stones to enable the Boundless Automation vision. At Immerse, we introduced many significant new products to our leading DeltaV portfolio. First, DeltaV Version 15, Feature Pack 1, is one of our biggest rollouts in recent history.\nThe package includes enhancements to software like DeltaV Live, the most advanced DeltaV HMI ever developed, and the introduction of a subscription controller, PK Flex. It also includes the DeltaV Edge Environment, a first-of-its-kind edge solution allowing users to securely move data into their enterprise environments. As we look at the next generation of software solutions and automation platforms, this is a key enabler to unlocking data that users previously discarded.\nThroughout the rest of the organization, we are also making focused investments in strategic areas. This includes next-generation intelligent devices to further cement our leadership position in our measurement and analytical portfolio, and relevant additions to our sustainability portfolio. At AspenTech, many of the new releases are focused on enabling sustainability and energy-transition segments, in addition to further building out capabilities like AI and DataWorks to enable self-optimizing asset management. Please turn to slide eight. On 11 October 2023, we closed the acquisition of NI and announced we will report the business as a new Test & Measurement segment in 2024.\nWe are very pleased with the progress already in the first month with NI and are excited about the opportunities in this business. We remain committed to the $165 million of Synergies by the end of year five, resulting in approximately 31% adjusted segment EBITDA when moving stock comp to corporate. As we have openly stated, NI completes a significant portion of our portfolio transformation, and we are excited to execute as a new company. We will, however, continue to be active with bolt-on acquisitions that fill technology gaps in our business, and we have the balance-sheet flexibility to do so.\nThese will be prioritized in four segments we introduced a year ago: Industrial Software, Test & Measurement, Factory Automation, and Smart Grid Solutions. In Q4, we completed two of these bolt-on acquisitions. Flexim is a global leader for clamp-on ultrasonic technology measuring liquids, gases, and steam. The business is highly complementary to our existing leading flow portfolio consisting of Coriolis, DP Flow, Mag, and Vortex, and will also serve attractive growth markets in the energy transition.\nWe also completed the acquisition of Afag in Q4, a highly strategic asset in the factory automation market. Afag's electric linear motion solutions, combined with our existing pneumatic motion offering, create a leading motion portfolio for Discrete industries in a $9 billion TAM. Please turn to slide nine. As I mentioned, the large pieces of our portfolio transformation are behind us. This slide shows that we were able to accomplish what we were able to accomplish over the last few years. We had three main objectives that I communicated when we started this journey. First, cohesiveness, which we now have with an unmatched technology stack.\nSecond, diversification. Discrete is now our second largest end-market with further opportunities to expand into attractive, diversified industries. And third, our growth is aligned to secular growth drivers. This alignment to energy security and affordability, sustainability and decarbonization, nearshoring, and digital transformation will allow Emerson to move to a more secular and less cyclical business profile. $36 billion worth of transactions. Disposing of assets with low single-digit growth profiles and adding businesses, we expect to grow cumulatively in the high single digits to low double digits.\nThe profitability improvement is also remarkable. Trading 30% GP businesses for those that operate +70% gross profits, which are already seeing, we are seeing, the benefits of today. We are all energized by the opportunity we have with this new Emerson. Please turn to slide 10.\nOur current strategic funnel is now over $10 billion in opportunity, with nearly two-thirds residing in our growth platforms. We're also encouraged by the activity of projects already in the funnel, considering the interest rate environment and global uncertainty. In Q4, Emerson was awarded over $500 million of project content, with over 60% of those in our growth platforms. This includes strategic wins in LNG, carbon capture, hydrogen, life sciences, and metals and mining. These successes are indicative of our team's focus and our technology's relevance within these markets.\nAs we look at further diversifying our portfolio into hybrid and energy-transition markets, 2023 was a fundamental foundational year. Specifically, there were three highly strategic projects to highlight. First, Emerson was selected to automate five different plants for Samsung Biologics as it standardizes on our DeltaV Automation Platform. The Emerson solution provides control for both production skids and for plant-wide operations. We are also currently engaging with a customer on the potential to leverage AspenTech software for future expansion. Secondly, in Q3, we highlighted Emerson's selection for the Port Arthur LNG project with Bechtel Energy and Sempra.\nThis quarter, we are pleased to announce we were also selected for another large-scale, world-class LNG facility in the United States. The Rio Grande LNG project from Bechtel Energy and NextDecade, located in Texas, will be capable of producing 17.6 million metric tons per annum of LNG across three liquefaction trains. Emerson is providing much of our leading technology, including analytical and measurement technology, and control, pressure relief, and isolation valves. And finally, AspenTech was awarded a Synergy win in the most recent quarter with a world-leading pulp and paper producer.\nEmerson's DeltaV system is already installed at the site, and through this relationship with the customer, Emerson was able to bring AspenTech to the table. Through this engagement, the customer chose to displace the current incumbent provider of adaptive process control software and instead moved to AspenTech. This example demonstrates the power of our Emerson AspenTech integrated solutions and the opportunity to expand AspenTech utilizing our global sales channel. These wins and the continued evolution of the funnel provide a strong foundation as we head into 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 11 that summarizes our Q4 financial results, which were in line with our expectations. Underlying sales growth was 5%, growing off a tough comp in 2022 when sales shifted from Q3 into Q4 due to China shutdowns and electronic component shortages. Price contributed approximately four points of growth. As expected with our typical seasonality, backlog declined sequentially about $300 million to 6.6 billion, up 12% versus where we entered 2023. Software and control sales grew 2% on an underlying basis, which now includes AspenTech as we lapped a year of ownership.\nThe Control Systems and Software business came in largely as expected, and it was comparing against a very strong prior-year Q4. AspenTech tends to see lower sales volume in our fiscal Q4 due to the timing of renewals, and its sales can be more variable due to ASC 606 accounting. The sales were on forecast, and importantly, ACV showed strong growth at 10.9% year-over-year. Intelligent Devices grew 6%, led by Process & Hybrid exposed businesses, mainly measurement, analytical, and final control. Our Discrete Automation business was down in the quarter with softer-than-expected demand and Europe and China weakness impacting this business.\nEmerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 25.5%. Operating leverage, excluding AspenTech, was 45%. Volume, margin accretive price cost, which included net material deflation and ongoing productivity programs, contributed to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 21% to $1.29. Lastly, free cash flow for the quarter of $838 million was up 17% versus the prior year. Please turn to slide 12. As Lal summarized, 2023 was an exceptional year for Emerson. Underlying sales growth was 10% with four points of price contribution. Software and Control and Intelligent Devices both finished with underlying sales growth of 10%.\nAll geographies reported strong sales growth with America's up 10%, Europe up 10%, and Asia, Middle East, and Africa up 9%. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 220 basis points to 25%. Operating leverage, excluding AspenTech, was 53%. As we've talked about throughout the year, this was driven by leverage on double-digit sales growth, strong execution by our operations teams, margin accretive price cost, and favorable product and project mix. Adjusted EPS grew 22% to $4.44 with $0.27 of contribution from AspenTech. Lastly, free cash flow of $2.4 billion was up 35% versus the prior year. This includes approximately $100 million from the interest on undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction.\nFor the year 2023, free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings was 88%, slightly ahead of our expectations. This also represents a 15.6% free cash flow margin, a metric we plan to utilize moving forward. Slide 13 details the drivers of adjusted EPS growth from the prior year. Operational performance was exceptional. 10% underlying sales growth and 53% segment-level operating leverage contributed $0.77 of year-over-year EPS growth. FX was a $0.12 headwind. Stock Comp was a $0.16 headwind versus the prior year due primarily to the mark-to-market accounting for the company's old stock compensation plan, which was mostly offset by pension and other corporate items.\nThe reduced share count resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase contributed $0.14, and the Copeland note receivable interest contributed $0.05 to adjusted EPS for the year. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 22% year-over-year to $4.44. Please turn to slide 14. We believe 2024 is shaping up to be another good year of financial performance. Our end-markets remain generally resilient, evidenced by 5% underlying orders growth in Q4 and for all of 2023. This has resulted in healthy backlog levels, which were up 12% versus where we entered 2023, giving us good visibility into 2024 sales. We also have good visibility through our MRO business, which was 65% of 2023 sales.\nThis day-to-day replacement business gives us good perspective on pace-of-business and remains constructive. Lastly, we are entering 2024 with a +$10 billion funnel, up $3 billion from where we entered 2023. This all feeds our 2024 outlook. Process & Hybrid end-markets remain strong, driven by secular trends like energy security, sustainability, and decarbonization, nearshoring, and digital transformation. We expect Process & Hybrid sales growth of mid-to-high single digits in 2024.\nWe continue to see investments moving forward in energy transition markets like LNG, nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, and renewables. We continue to see nearshoring investments here in the US and around the world in life sciences and metals and mining, especially midstream metals processing and refining, which is being expanded to the United States and Europe. These secular trends in Process & Hybrid end-markets and our ability to help customers be successful give us confidence in our 2024 outlook. Discrete markets are obviously in a different part of the cycle, which impacts both our Discrete Automation and Test & Measurement businesses.\nOrders have been negative for two to three quarters, but we expect this to begin to turn positive in the second half of 2024. We expect underlying sales to be flat to up low single digits in 2024 for our Discrete businesses. From a world areas perspective, it should continue to be a balance, and we expect each world area to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Please turn to slide 15, where we have outlined our 2024 guidance. Our later-cycle exposure, robust backlog, and continued orders resiliency support our 2024 guidance for underlying sales growth of 4% to 6%.\nWe expect both Intelligent Devices and Software and Control to be within this guidance range for underlying sales. Test & Measurement is excluded from 2024 underlying sales and is expected to add another 10 to 10.5 points to reported growth, or approximately $1.6 billion of sales. FX is expected to be a one-point tailwind. We remain committed to driving differentiated incremental margins through our operational execution. Operating leverage, which now includes AspenTech but excludes Test & Measurement, is expected to be in the mid-to-high 40%s in 2024, which includes cost savings from our corporate and platform rightsizing.\nPrice cost will continue to be margin accretive in 2024, and ongoing productivity and cost savings will drive further benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to increase from $4.44 in 2023 to between $5.15 and 5.35 in 2024, an 18% increase at the midpoint. This includes approximately $0.35 to 0.40 from NI, inclusive of stock compensation, and approximately $0.32 to 0.34 from AspenTech. There is some movement below the line in stock compensation, pension, and other corporate items, which roughly offset year-over-year. This detail can be found in the appendix. As a reminder, stock compensation from NI is now reported in our Corporate Stock Compensation line item.\nNet interest expense is expected to be approximately $105 million. Lastly, free cash flow is expected to be $2.6 to 2.7 billion, which we will discuss in more detail on the next slide. For Q1, we expect underlying sales to increase 6.5% to 8.5% with leverage in the mid-30%s. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.05, a 31% increase at the midpoint. NI is expected to contribute approximately $0.05.\nAs I mentioned, we will discuss some additional details on slide 16 regarding our free cash flow. We ended 2023 with free cash flow of $2.4 billion, or 15.6% of sales. This included just over $100 million of after-tax cash from interest on the undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction, which will not repeat in 2024. Taking this into consideration and starting from a foundation of approximately $2.3 billion of free cash flow, we expect approximately $300 million of contribution from NI operations and another $350 million increase from base operations.\nThis would have resulted in free cash flow margin of approximately 16.8%, or $2.9 billion of free cash flow. However, we have two headwinds in 2024. First, we expect approximately $200 million of acquisition-related cash payments associated with the NI and bolt-on acquisitions. Second, we are expecting an elevated CapEx spend related to facility expansions, which will increase our CapEx to approximately 2.5% of sales, up from our historical and future expected rate of approximately 2% of sales. Including these two headwinds bring us to our guidance of $2.6 to 2.7 billion of free cash flow, or 15.2% to 15.4% free cash flow margin.\nBefore we turn the call over to Q&A, I will quickly discuss capital allocation on slide 17. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. Internal development and organic growth investments remain a high priority. This accelerated in 2023, with R&D spend now representing 7% of revenue, and NI will further mix this up in 2024. This increase was driven by increased innovation in our four priority breakthrough domains: disruptive technologies and measurement, sustainability, software-defined automation systems, and self-optimizing asset software.\nWe also remain committed to the dividend, and announced today we are beginning our 68th year of consecutive increased dividends, with our $0.525 per share declared dividend this quarter. The right side of this chart is where we have flexibility.\nWe will continue to be active in pursuit of strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and targeted areas, and we will remain committed to strong returns on these investments. Finally, we plan to have approximately $500 million of share repurchases in 2024. We are energized as we enter the new fiscal year 2024, and we are focused on the execution of our plans. Thanks for your attention. I will turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a couple specific NATI questions, if I could. There's some noise with the bolt-on. So could you just be clear for NATI revenues in 2024? And also, if you could provide any color on how their orders progressed in Q4. And finally, maybe a little bit of color on how much of that Synergy target happens in the first year.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Hi, Jeff. Lal here. Good morning. So on the revenue, as Mike stated, $1.6 billion is the assumption. It's not in the underlying sales, as he reported. Orders in the environment, as I expressed in my presentation, are still challenging in the business, exiting the quarter at down 16%, which is very much aligned to the plan that we had in place.\nWe do expect, much like in our core Discrete markets, orders to flatten out as we get into the second half of the year. So feel very much that they're under in plan from an orders perspective, although still in a challenging environment. Then lastly, on Synergies, look, we got off to a really good start, day one. The team's executing very, very well. We haven't given guidance on year one. What I did, I will say, is that about half the Synergies will be delivered in the first two years.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nRight. Just as an unrelated question, maybe it's for Mike, but just thinking about the organic guide for 2024, you're exiting here at 4% price with 5% order growth, right? It feels like there's a little bit of room in those organic numbers. Maybe just share how much price is embedded in that 4% to 6% for 2024.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Jeff, the 2024 price assumption is 2%.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCan you just talk about within the cash guidance, what you're assuming on working capital, and then that $250 million that's kind of running through this year? How does all that trend kind of into 2025?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I'll start with the second half or the second part of the question first. The $250 million is really one time and in the year related to the acquisitions and some of the higher CapEx that we've got.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. And then just working capital?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nOh, working capital for the year. Yeah. We exited working capital, trade working capital, at about 20.5%, and we're expecting about 50 basis points coming off 20.5% of revenue. So we do expect to have a little bit of balance sheet goodness in 2024.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Then just one last one, just on orders. How do you guys kind of see the funnel stepped up a bit, the backlog? You get into backlog seasonally, but how do you guys kind of see orders and backlog trending over the course of the year here?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I'll comment, Steve. Obviously, we exit at 5%, so we have optimism and we have momentum out there. Obviously, we have some challenges in Discrete, as we talked about in the business. I think as you think about the start of the year, my expectations are flat-to-low single digits. But as we get into the second half of the year, my expectation is exiting in the mid-single digit range. And for the full year, somewhere in the low-single to mid-single digit orders.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. And thanks a lot.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nAnd then, Steve, just on backlog, if that pattern holds, there shouldn't be a meaningful change in backlog as we exit 2024. So the backlog should remain healthy.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe first off, just looking at slide 15. So I wanted to understand why the operating leverage steps up after Q1 when the organic sales growth steps down. Is there any one segment or subsegment or something happening with mix that's driving that? And should we assume that that organic sales growth just steadily decelerates through the year?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Julian. Yeah. There is a little bit of mix, and I would say the Discrete Automation softness that we are expecting in the first half of the year plays in on that. We've been ramping up our spend around growth platforms and innovation. And so as you come into Q1, there's a little bit of a year-over-year comparable that plays into that Q1 leverage as well.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nI see. So it's really Discrete sort of getting better, and that pushes up the up leverage balance of the year?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYes. That's correct.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nYeah.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nAnd obviously, we're driving restructuring the Discrete business given the trend in the orders, and you will see that margin expansion come through in the second half, which would drive up the leverage rates.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up would be around, I suppose, historically, process cycles in automation followed Discrete by around 12 months, and we see Discrete is soft now. Are there any sort of specific reasons why process should hold up differently this time versus history instead of following Discrete lower later this year?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nIt's a good question, Julian, one that we've thought a lot about and been watching very carefully. The fact of the matter is that we have some very unusual secular trends going on in the world right now. I think a lot of our process activity is driven by three critical areas: the nearshoring activity, which impacts life sciences and the metals and mining value chain; the energy affordability and security, which is impacting significant continued investment in liquefied natural gas and nuclear; and thirdly, equally important sustainability.\nI think we're past the tipping point in terms of our customers' commitment around sustainability, and we're seeing continued investments there. So we believe those will transcend certain economic cycles, and that will impact how we should think about the strength of Process as we go through 2024. Ram, you have something to add?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And the other point I'd make, Julian, is the capital spend in the Process & Hybrid industries has been pretty disciplined. There hasn't been a boom in capital to cause a correction as we move forward, as opposed to the prior cycles we saw. So I think that disciplined capital spend, plus obviously the trends that Lal identified where the sustainability investments provide that tailwind, we expect Process to continue to run for a lot longer.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nI see. So you\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nProcess & Hybrid.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. & Hybrid. Yeah.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nGot it. So the Process & Hybrid orders growth should stay fairly steady through 2024.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThat is our expectation. Yes, sir. Yes.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nFantastic. Thanks for the help.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel, your line is now live.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director of Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. The line's live, but I'm not, so sorry for that. So National Instruments, I think that the Q4 fiscal sales are down, I think, high single-digit organic. Is that the right number? Is my math correct? Looks like the guide implies flattish to maybe slightly down organic. Just wondering what the profile is on that and anything on orders there would be helpful.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So Ram here, Nigel. From an orders perspective, as Lal indicated, in the last quarter, which is our Q4, down 16% in orders, we expect orders to remain down for the first half and turn positive in the second half. You are right. The $1.6 billion that we're guiding will translate to down 5% to 6% for the year from a sales perspective. Sales should turn positive in Q4. So we'll have down sales for Q1, Q2, and Q3 and positive in Q4.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director of Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. I'm sorry I missed the order number. Thanks for clarifying that. Then on the backlog, backlog down from $6.9 to 6.6 billion quarter-to-quarter. Maybe just clarify. I don't think that's unusual from a seasonal perspective. I think it's normal to see Q4 backlog consumption. Was there any FX revaluation impacts there? Just want to make sure to understand the organic movement there.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo. That's a consistent gap basis.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director of Electrical Equipment and Multi-Industry, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner of Multi-Industry Research, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Congrats on...\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner of Multi-Industry Research, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\n[crosstalk]...getting all the stuff done. Lal, it sounds like you were just in China. If you were around the world, it seems pretty topical to get an update from what maybe you saw there. I'll just leave it there.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Actually, on this particular trip, did not hit China. We'll do that later in the year. I was there in May. But having said that, look, we had a very good year in China. We exited orders at 11% in China. So feel good about the momentum there again. The investments there really around energy security and nearshoring are very significant. Sales were in the mid-single digits for the year, but we continue to see robustness in our core Process & Hybrid spaces. And not unlike what Europe and the United States are struggling on the Discrete side. But certainly, the Process & Hybrid strength will continue as we expect into 2024.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner of Multi-Industry Research, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nAnd then the Discrete in China is negative, I'd assume, this quarter?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYes. It is negative in the quarter. Yes, sir.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner of Multi-Industry Research, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One, just on the NI sort of earnings contribution for the year, $0.05 in Q1 would be kind of running, I guess, $0.10 a quarter or a little better for the rest of the year. But any more detail on that cadence? Anything that's sort of cost-heavy upfront and then the progression through the course of the year as you're thinking about that earnings contribution?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo. I don't have anything else to add, Joe. I mean, obviously, as Ram expressed, a volume expansion as we get to the second half of the year that will drive leverage and incremental profits. But that's really what the tail of the tape there is.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. And then on the R&D side and the step up to 7%, it sounds like it goes even higher in 2024. Any context on that? And then sort of additional insight on sort of the products and verticals that are getting outsized investments, as well as what your returns focus is on R&D, the prioritization around share gain or sort of the revenue dollars that you want, returns on R&D investment, any sort of context around that?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nFrom a dollars perspective, yeah, we get the benefit of Aspen coming in. That mixes us up. And then NI comes in, and that also mixes us up. So you'll continue to see that commitment to growth, innovation, accelerate, and increase as we move on.\nAnd in terms of where the investment is going, a lot of the investment really is across the four technology areas we've consistently showed you guys. It's Disruptive Measurement, which is the sensing technology in our measurement technologies business, our automation system, the next-generation automation system that Lal referenced in the presentation, and also collaborative technology development with Aspen around asset performance management. So those are the areas where we see lots of opportunity in terms of new-to-the-world type innovation that we can drive as an automation company, and that's where the investment's going.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Industrial Multi-Industry, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Industrial Multi-Industry, Oppenheimer\n\nI was curious about the funnel conversion comments. I think last quarter, you indicated that the conversion rates of those are picking up as the size of the projects ramps and some of the newer technologies and applications. So just curious trend line if you see any further acceleration and how much of that notion is baked into the fiscal 2024 guidance, or could that be an opportunity?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo. Hey, Chris, Lal here. No, look, we continue to see the funnel expand organically to begin with. So it did grow from quarter to over quarter, which is why we thought it was important to show you. But what's most interesting, it's growing in the right spots for us. It's growing along the growth platforms where we have the focus of the organization. So that comprises about $6.6 billion of the funnel today, of which energy security and transition is a big part of that, and sustainability and decarbonization is a large part of it.\nIf you look at the wins, they are very much aligned in the same way as the funnel, winning at about 60%, aligned on the growth platforms-ish, with energy transition a big part of what we are converting here. So feel really good about it. We're watching it carefully, of course, in terms of movement through FID and other elements. But at this point in time, continue to have optimism, particularly products that are purely connected to national security, nearshoring, or energy affordability elements. So feel pretty good about what we see in front of us.\n\nChristopher Glynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Industrial Multi-Industry, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. If I could ask another on Discrete, what kind of impacts are you seeing in terms of channel versus end demand?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nFrom a channel perspective, I mean, if you're referencing destocking, we're not seeing that. I think the Discrete slowness is purely market-driven. Certainly, European machine builders, China as an end-market, and an overall slowdown in the Factory Automation segment in North America. And you see that with obviously a lot of our peers that have a lot more exposure in Discrete, frankly, versus our peers who are holding our own in terms of the order rate decline in Discrete. And we do expect to see a second-half 2024 positive orders for the business.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz [Managing Director and US Industrial Sector Head of Multi-Industry/Conglomerates, and Engineering and Constructio\n\nWell, I think last quarter, when you began to talk about FY 2024, you mentioned more normalized incrementals in the mid-30% range, but you're going to mid-to-high 40% incremental margins. So could you give us a little more color into the assumptions? I know you got pricing for 2024, and you're starting off a little lower, but it seems like you're still getting supply chain tailwind benefits. And there, how would you assess your performance versus your longer-term algorithm of 35%? Is it possible that that algorithm could be a bit conservative?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nIt's possible. Yes, Andy. We've been operating in the mid-50%s over the last couple of years. There's a significant amount of momentum around cost in the business. As I mentioned, we have tailwinds that will be delivered through the actions we're taking, not just within the segments, but also at corporate as we go through 2024. Now, having said that, on the supply chain side, we're on the positive side of most of the measures. Obviously, logistics environment is flipped. And on material flow, generally significantly better.\nOf course, we fight spot shortages, as you'd expect in any business, but generally, we are in a very different world on the supply chain. So that's all very positive. So it's really around execution. Look, we have the gross margins of the business are 49% in 2023. They'll expand further, as Mike described, in 2024. And with that comes an expectation of a higher leverage and a higher incremental for the business. So at this point, feel very comfortable with the guide we put out there for the year in that mid-to-high 40%s, which is, I think, differentiated. We'll really think through what we talk about and guide on a longer-term basis from a financial-plan perspective as we go through the year.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nJust to amplify that a little bit, Andy, we've also been talking about this $100 million of corporate platform cost takeout, which has been reading through in the businesses and will read through in the business in 2024 as well, which is an uplift for the year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz [Managing Director and US Industrial Sector Head of Multi-Industry/Conglomerates, and Engineering and Constructio\n\nIt's great to hear. Then I know you want to retire the KOB1, KOB2, KOB3 names, but when we think about 2024, I think you've been averaging something like 65% KOB3. Would you expect that to hold up at around that level? And what are you seeing on the KOB3 side? Is there just a lot more activity that could also help with margins given that tends to be higher margin work?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, we certainly expect MRO in the 60% range for 2024, Andy. You're absolutely right. It's the most price-inelastic portion of our business. It's typically replaced like-for-like within processes. So we feel we have a great understanding of where the $150 billion of Installed Base is located. We have specific programs across our service organizations and selling organizations to ensure that we mine that and that we keep that product evergreen. So feel good about that. But in that 60% range, I think would be the right expectation.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz [Managing Director and US Industrial Sector Head of Multi-Industry/Conglomerates, and Engineering and Constructio\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director of Industrials, Stephens\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHi, Tommy.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director of Industrials, Stephens\n\nWell, I wanted to start with a follow-up on Discrete. You've called out the weakness there previously. Obviously, it's been front and center today. So I'm just curious, were there incremental pockets of weakness you picked up through the last quarter? And then as you look through to the second half of the coming fiscal year where you expect a return to growth, is the visibility there more just a comps issue, or are there some green shoots in terms of the real underlying demand that you can call out at this point?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nNo. So a couple of things. What we're experiencing through the quarter, what we have experienced through the quarter is demand-driven weakness. As Ram accurately portrayed, it's not a destocking element. As a matter of fact, a very small percentage of our business runs through stocking distributors in the Discrete side. But nevertheless, it's demand that we are really focused on. And it's global weakness across the key markets.\nNow, having said that, the comparables do get easier as we get into the second half. We're not counting on underlying demand conditions in the Discrete market significantly improving in the second half. What we're benefiting from is obviously the comparables for us.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director of Industrials, Stephens\n\nMakes sense. And then if I look at the consolidated outlook you've provided for Q1 and then the full year, you're starting the year in the high single-digit range, full year in the mid-single-digit range. So there's some deceleration implied there. Is there some conservatism around there just given the issues you've called out on the Discrete side? Are there comps items that you would point out for us?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThere's nothing extraordinary other than we got to be cautious on the Discrete cycle.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director of Industrials, Stephens\n\nGreat. We appreciate the insight, and I'll turn it back.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Tommy.\n\nOperator",

Please note that this event is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson Q3 Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Mike Baughman, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor Statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson President and CEO Lal Karsanbhai for his opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you, Colleen, and good morning. This quarter's results are a testament to the tremendous people of Emerson. I am humbled by what you do every day. Thank you for the passion, energy, and the effort you bring to our great company every single day. Two and a half years ago, when I became CEO, we expressed our vision for accelerated value creation: culture, portfolio, and execution. I am proud today, more than ever before, of the progress we have made. The Emerson management system has empowered our leaders and opened the world of possibilities for our company in the field of innovation and commercial excellence, with a higher growth, more cohesive portfolio. But above all, the Emerson management system is the tool that enables our team to continue to deliver differentiated financial results.\nThe work never ends, but I am proud of how far we have journeyed and the clear road ahead. Please turn to slide three. Q3 was an exceptional quarter, and our teams continue to perform well and deliver for our shareholders. We made tremendous progress on our strategic priorities, closing the Copeland transaction, launching new-to-the-world products, and winning several key projects in our organic growth platforms: energy transition, industrial software, and priority discrete and hybrid markets. We have once again increased our expectations for the year based on our continued operational execution. We now expect double-digit underlying sales growth, approximately 50% operating leverage, and over 20% adjusted EPS growth for 2023, top quartile performance. As we look ahead, we are energized by our value creation opportunities.\nEmerson is and will continue to benefit from our significant exposure to secular growth trends like energy affordability and security, sustainability and decarbonization, digital transformation, and nearshoring. Over 30% of our sales have directly aligned to these trends, as we discussed at our investor conference in November. Our technology and solutions are highly differentiated in these spaces, positioning our business for growth. We're also innovating for these markets, helping customers solve their toughest challenges with disruptive technology and solutions. Our portfolio transformation is paying off as we have aligned our cohesive portfolio to these secular trends, and our favorable value drivers, combined with our Emerson management system, provide the roadmap for future success at Emerson. Turning to slide four, this quarter exceeded expectations across the board. Underlying orders were up 3%, led by high single-digit process and hybrid demand growth. We continue to see secular trends driving the demand strength.\nAs an example, LNG projects continue to move forward, and customers' energy transition and sustainability budgets are growing, improving resilience, both for greenfield projects in hydrogen, clean fuels, and renewables, and for brownfield decarbonization opportunities like emissions reductions and carbon capture. Renewables is a particular area of strength. We are winning based on our superior technology and breadth of capabilities, which we'll discuss shortly. Nearshoring is also driving incremental investments around the globe in areas like life sciences and metals and mining. It is still early stages of global stimulus, but programs like the United States IRA, CHIPS, and IIJA are driving additional conversations with our customers, which we expect to turn into funded projects down the road. Our strong performance in process and hybrid was partially offset by demand in discrete, which continues to slow. Orders were down in Q3 against tougher comparisons for this piece of the business.\nAs we mentioned previously, Europe, especially Germany, continues to slow, and we have seen some softening in the US and Asia. Looking at the overall business, and given continued robust demand and strong underlying growth drivers, we still expect mid-single-digit full-year order growth. The continued demand and improving supply chain environment, which includes improved availability of electronic components, enabled 14% underlying sales growth in the quarter, above our expectations. The Americas and Europe were up 11% and 13%, respectively, while Asia, Middle East, and Africa were up 20%, strong performance off last year's impact of the Shanghai COVID shutdowns. Intelligent devices, software, and control were both up double digits. It is clear when we speak to customers and compete for projects that our technology is winning in the marketplace. We are proud of what we have built and confident this will continue.\nSoftware and control growth of 19% is a testament to our leading control systems, DeltaV, Innovation, which are well positioned where our customers are spending: areas like life sciences, metals and mining, hydrogen, clean fuels, and renewables. Within the quarter, we won large projects in life sciences, metals and mining, including lithium and LNG. Intelligent devices grew 13%. Final control, measurement, and analytical are the de facto standards for traditional energy, transition energy, chemical, and power markets across the globe. This later cycle exposure and the business's continued technology leadership in areas like control valves, actuators, regulators, pressure, temperature, flow, level, and wireless are differentiators for Emerson and are leading to strong financial returns. This strong sales performance and the continued operational execution of our teams led to 59% operating leverage in the quarter, excluding AspenTech. Favorable impacts from price, cost, and mix also drove accretive margin performance.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.29, beating our guidance, again driven by the strong sales and operational performance. Free cash flow was up 83% year-over-year and is up 47% year to date. Please turn to slide five. We continue to accelerate progress on our strategic priorities. On 31 May, we closed the Copeland transaction. Emerson received $9.7 billion in upfront cash, or approximately $8 billion after tax, for the transaction. We also have the future proceeds from the $2.25 billion Copeland note receivable and our 40% common equity ownership with a transaction value of $1.7 billion. Post-closing, Emerson has a net cash position, and taking into consideration the NI acquisition, Emerson expects to have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than two. I also want to provide a quick update on our corporate and platform rightsizing activities we announced at the beginning of the year.\nAs planned, we did not have any stranded costs due to the Copeland sale, and are well on track to achieve our $100 million annualized cost savings by 2024. We also released our ESG report in June, highlighting a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity from our 2018 baseline. This achievement surpasses our 20% target six years ahead of schedule. In the report, we also highlight numerous examples of how Emerson is helping customers navigate the energy transition and the application of our technology to reducing emissions and energy usage. Lastly, before moving on to some exciting innovation and customer wins, I wanted to provide a quick update on the NI acquisition. We remain on track to close the acquisition in the first half of our fiscal 2024, and the teams are actively working on integration planning as we prepare to be ready for day one.\nIn late June, NI shareholders voted in favor of our acquisition. HSR was once again approved, and all necessary regulatory filings have been made. NI released their earnings last week with another record sales quarter, up 5% year on year and strong margin performance. Demand is seeing supply chain constraints easing, which helped drive their sales performance by converting backlog despite the negative orders environment, which was down 17%. The demand environment for the business is playing out largely as we expected, with discrete and semiconductor weakness expected to improve as the calendar year goes on. Please turn to slide six. As the rate of our customer sustainability and digital investments continue to accelerate, Emerson is ensuring that we are positioned to capture this spend. Part of this is through our strong dedication to innovation and new-to-the-world products. Recently, Emerson has had numerous impactful innovations.\nFirst, aspenONE V14 is the next step in helping customers on the sustainability journey. Not only does V14 offer more than 100 sustainability-specific models, it also provides solutions to help customers manage emissions and design new hydrogen processes. V14 also further incorporates artificial intelligence, which, when combined with first principle models, helps users reach optimal production, increasing profitability while reducing emissions. Emerson also recently launched enhancements to our AMS Device Manager software platform, now allowing for more seamless integration with AspenTech solutions like MTEL. This allows users to have more access to critical intelligent device data for use in advanced analytics and models. This example shows the differentiation of the Emerson plus AspenTech portfolio and technology synergy opportunities together.\nEmerson has long been a trusted partner of utilities around the globe, as evidenced by the fact that Ovation controls approximately 50% of the electricity generated in the United States. This leadership uniquely positions Emerson to support our customers' transition to renewables, and we are doing so through our new integrated renewable energy control solution, Ovation Green. Ovation Green allows customers to manage their renewables assets like solar, wind, hydro, and hydrogen, all in one platform, and we are already seeing early success with some of the largest utilities in the United States. Lastly, our measurement and analytical business recently launched a new-to-the-world non-contacting radar device that is ideally suited for a range of applications in chemical, life sciences, and food and beverage. With advanced capabilities like Bluetooth and a built-in historian to store process data and insights, the transmitter is optimized for ease of use and simplicity.\nThe device incorporates radar technology, a fast-growing technology in the measurement space. As we look at continued growth in our measurement business, this innovation will serve as a foundation to building level as the next technology pillar, accompanying our leadership in pressure, temperature, and flow. As one of our key growth drivers, Emerson is committed to accelerating innovation and meeting the rapidly evolving needs of our customers, like the ones highlighted here. Turning to slide seven. At our November investor conference, we outlined our through-the-cycle growth strategy, which includes our strategic focus on organic growth platforms. These markets, including life sciences, metals and mining, factory automation, industrial software, and energy transition, are areas closely aligned to the secular growth trends that are driving incremental customer investment. This is demonstrated in the evolution of our funnel over the past nine months.\nNot only have we successfully expanded our funnel to $9.7 billion over this timeframe, up from $7.1 billion, but nearly all of this growth can be attributed to our growth markets, namely energy transition, life sciences, and metals and mining. Our energy transition funnel is now nearly $5 billion, up from $3.5 billion in November. This expanded funnel is driven by new project announcements in hydrogen, clean fuels, carbon capture, and EV batteries, all where we are actively engaged and our technology is well suited. We have also continued to expand our metals and mining and life science funnel, and we are now capturing additional strategic projects in our funnel as we dedicate more time and resources toward pursuing these engagements. In Q3 alone, we added over 300 projects to the funnel and were awarded contracts in over 50.\nThis indicates a solid pace of project announcements as nearshoring and sustainability trends spread globally. We expect these organic growth platforms will grow double digits through the cycle, and we are off to an excellent start in 2023. Please turn to slide eight, where we'll highlight a few key wins across these segments, which underscore the power of Emerson's highly differentiated portfolio of solutions and the opportunity ahead for Emerson. The LNG wave continues to progress, and Emerson is winning our share of opportunities. Of the projects that have moved forward over the past two years, Emerson has been awarded content in seven, demonstrating our continued leadership in this space. These are large projects with ample automation opportunity. On average, approximately $10 million of automation opportunity per million tons per annum of liquefaction.\nOur unmatched portfolio of measurement devices, valves, control systems, and now optimization software differentiates Emerson as the only automation company capable of providing a holistic solution. Emerson's leading project execution is also a key differentiator for these large and complex projects. Through our Project Certainty approach, Emerson helps customers expedite project timelines and reduce project costs, key measures to reaching profitability faster. One of these seven projects was the Port Arthur LNG project. Emerson is excited to announce it will be supporting Bechtel Energy and Sempra Infrastructure in the automation of the Port Arthur LNG phase one project. This liquefaction and export terminal in Southeast Texas is a premier LNG project designed for safe, reliable, and efficient operations, delivering LNG to global markets through two trains capable of producing up to 13.5 million metric tons per annum.\nEmerson was chosen as a key automation partner for Bechtel Energy, providing our leading DeltaV control system, final control valves, and measurement technology. Further, on slide nine, the next market we'd like to highlight is the battery value chain. This is an area where we are winning projects based on the breadth, depth, and strength of Emerson's end-to-end capabilities, from the mining of lithium and copper to refining and processing, and finally to EV battery manufacturing, assembly, and recycling. In 2022, Emerson technology helped produce over 65% of global electric vehicles. We are excited to continue supporting companies around the world as production expands across each of these high-growth segments. Recently, Emerson was selected to automate two very strategic projects in mining. First, the Ganfeng Lithium Project in Argentina.\nEmerson's DeltaV control system was selected to automate the large-scale lithium mine, a strategic win in the lithium triangle between Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia that holds much of the world's lithium reserves. DeltaV was selected because of its differentiated and flexible architecture and commissioning savings with CHARMs. The next project success was for Codelco and the Andina Copper Mine in Chile. Codelco is the world's largest producer of copper, and Andina's site will represent over 10% of Codelco's overall output. Emerson's DeltaV and control software were selected to help automate the treatment of water on the site, allowing Codelco to accurately control water quality, efficiency, and recycling. Emerson recently won a contract with one of the largest EV manufacturers because of our unique ability to support production across multiple processes in the value chain.\nWith this project, Emerson will be the trusted automation partner to support two facilities: a lithium refining project and cathode production facility in Texas. DeltaV was chosen for both projects due to its robust software architecture and ability to bring together previous islands of automation. As the customer continues to grow operations globally with numerous expansions and new operations, Emerson is well positioned to be the supplier of choice given the unique nature and value of the capabilities that we can deliver. Emerson was also recently awarded a large project with a leading German EV manufacturer to help automate the battery cell assembly process. As we look at future opportunities, NI has a leadership position with many of the largest EV and battery manufacturers in the world.\nNI's differentiated hardware and software solutions help customers with the R&D, testing, and validation of batteries and vehicles, and we look forward to leveraging those relationships to expand our current factory automation business and build upon our recent successes. As you can tell, we are energized by these projects and our relevance with customers. We will share our progress as Emerson continues to partner with leading EV manufacturers around the world and benefit from the strength and differentiation of our portfolio of assets. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 11. Our Q3 financial results were outstanding, and before talking about that, I want to thank our global teams for their hard work and execution.\nOur Emerson management system is driving value, as evidenced by our continued sales growth, margin expansion, earnings growth, and free cash flow performance. Turning to the results, underlying sales growth exceeded our expectations at 14%. GAAP sales were also up 14% for the quarter, and price contributed approximately five points of growth. Backlog of $6.9 billion remained flat quarter over quarter. Software and control performed better than we expected, growing underlying sales 19% due to increased availability of electronic components and our ability to convert more of the backlog in this business. Intelligent devices grew 13%, led by process and hybrid exposed businesses, mainly measurement, analytical, and final control. These two businesses are leaders in later cycle markets and have a large installed base, which, along with the continued backlog conversion, contributed to strong growth in the quarter.\nFrom an industry perspective, process and hybrid remain healthy with double-digit growth in the quarter. As Lal mentioned, discrete activity has continued to slow but still exhibited mid-single-digit sales growth due to backlog conversion. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 370 basis points to 26.9%. Leverage excluding AspenTech was 59%. Strong sales growth, margin accretive price cost, and favorable product and project mix all reflect the excellent execution by our operations teams and contributed to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 40% to $1.29, and I will discuss the details of that growth on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow of $769 million was up 83% versus the prior year quarter. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings was 97%. The strong earnings growth and working capital improvement helped contribute to the free cash flow growth.\nPlease turn to slide 11 for the details of adjusted EPS and bridge from the prior year. Most importantly, the strong 14% underlying sales growth and 59% segment level operating leverage contributed $0.29 of EPS growth year-over-year. Stock compensation was a $0.06 headwind due to lower stock comp expense in the prior year, but that was more than offset by other corporate items and tax, which were an $0.08 tailwind. The reduced share count resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase completed in the Q1 contributed $0.04 to adjusted EPS. Lastly, now that the Copeland transaction is closed, we are including the interest from the Copeland note receivable in adjusted results and guidance moving forward. The Copeland note interest contributed $0.02 to adjusted EPS in the Q3, and it is important to note this was not included in our May guidance.\nOverall, adjusted EPS grew 40% year-over-year to $1.29. Turning to slide 12, and as we look ahead to the rest of the year, I'd like to highlight a few key things. In general, end markets remain resilient. We have increased our expectations for process to double-digit sales growth with meaningful contribution from secular growth segments, energy transition, and energy security. With continued strength in life sciences, and metals and mining, we now expect hybrid to grow low double digits in 2023. We are discussing nearshoring initiatives with more and more customers. This is not just a trend in the United States, and we see near- and long-term benefits around the globe. For example, our team recently visited Australia and China, where we spoke to customers about their plans to make investments in new markets like life sciences.\nAs a global leader for providing automation for this market, these customers are tapping Emerson to support their investments. Discrete demand is continuing to slow, especially in Europe, and we are beginning to see the impacts in the United States and Asia. Sales growth expectations, when combined with our safety and productivity commercial exposure, are in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range as we have worked through backlog. The supply chain environment has continued to improve, allowing us to work through our backlog as we head into Q4. Price cost has been a significant tailwind in 2023, a reflection of our commercial excellence. We expect price for the year to approach 4 points, and we will remain diligent on price as a key performance lever. As we look to the future, we are excited by our growth opportunities.\nEmerson is uniquely positioned to support our customers' investments in key areas we expect to grow double digits through the cycle. We've demonstrated our leadership in energy transition markets like LNG, nuclear, hydrogen, clean fuels, carbon capture, and renewables. We are well positioned to capture the long-term investments driven by nearshoring. Finally, we have a leading and differentiated software portfolio that is expected to have double-digit ACV growth through the cycle. These are all trends we expect to continue to augment Emerson's growth for the foreseeable future. Please turn to slide 13. As this chart shows, our performance this year has been exceptional. We have successfully executed on our portfolio transformation while continuing to drive strong results across the business and exceed on our commitments.\nStrong operational performance, improved price cost management, and more favorable mix as we went through the year gave us the ability to increase our expectations throughout the year. For 2023, underlying sales growth is now expected to be toward the top end of our previous 8.5% to 10% guidance range. We expect both intelligent devices and software and control to be on par with this overall updated guidance. As a reminder, AspenTech will begin rolling into our underlying sales in Q4 as we lap a year of ownership. We are also increasing our expectation for segment operating leverage based on the strong Q3 result, sales strength, favorable price cost, and continued strong operational performance. We now expect segment operating leverage to be approximately 50% excluding AspenTech. Adjusted EPS has been raised to $4.40 to $4.45, a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.\nPlease note this includes $0.06 of interest from the Copeland note receivable that we are now including in our adjusted results, $0.02 from Q3, and approximately $0.04 in Q4. AspenTech is still expected to contribute approximately $0.25 for the year. Post-Copeland transaction close, please note we have now included an estimate for the Copeland equity loss in our GAAP guidance numbers, which, in addition to the undeployed proceeds, is being removed from our adjusted results and guidance. We have also adjusted our expected tax rate to approximately 22% for the year. Free cash flow is expected to be $2.2 to 2.3 billion for the year, of which AspenTech is contributing approximately $300 million. Thanks for your attention. I will now turn back to Nick to open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. This time we'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster.\nFirst question will be from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHello. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Hello as well. Good morning. Good morning, Nigel. Good morning. Just, I thought maybe just to start off on the obviously very strong operating performance, but margins were the real standout. So I'm just wondering, as we go into 2024, I mean, is there anything we should think about in terms of maybe some headwinds to margins? I'm thinking here about measurement analytics, very strong sequentially up to 20.7%. Are you confident you can grow off these margins going forward?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nHey, Nigel. Yes, we're very excited about the leverage that we've had with 40%, 53%, and then 59% in the quarter. You do see that operating leverage tip down a little bit in the Q4, and we're going to exit the year around 50%. So yeah, we feel good about the operating leverage, and we're not really in a position to talk about 2024 at this point, but we certainly are pleased with the current year performance.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nAnd I'll just add a little bit of color. Thanks, Mike. I do believe that the underlying work that we've been doing around price, cost management, thinking about how we bring our differentiated technology to market will be sustainable through the cycle as we talked about. And we'll look at the leverage targets as we go to 2024, and we'll talk about that later in the fall. But I feel very good about the momentum in the business and the executional elements that are going to impact our ability to deliver differentiated margins on a go-forward basis.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is on the control systems organic growth in the high teens. That's a longer cycle business, and I don't really think about that as necessarily cycling up big or down big. So, I mean, how much of that is coming from sort of accelerated backlog conversion with lead times, maybe some chip lead times coming down? And, sort of, how do we think about that going forward? Do you think you can maintain above-average growth rates in control systems and software?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYes. Hey, Nigel, Ram here. Yeah, I think this particular quarter and this year, I think in the second half, the lead times catching up, and better supply chains, and shipping backlog is what is driving the significant growth in our systems business. But with that said, the project funnel is very good. The KOB3 is very good. So our expectations are the momentum in that business should continue into 2024.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ram.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHi, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nWell, so you reiterated your mid-single-digit order growth forecast for this year, and you came in at 3% this quarter despite the discrete market slowdown. You obviously gave us the new funnel of opportunities with mid-20% organic growth. So does that mean that Emerson's orders could re-accelerate from here, or how do you think about that given the market that you laid out?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, certainly, Andy. We feel confident in that mid-single-digit guide that we laid out a quarter ago and believe we'll exit the year in that rate. The process and hybrid orders are in the high single digits as we exited the quarter, and that's where a significant amount of the momentum lies, not just in the capital expansion, but related to just everyday business activity. Of course, offset by the discrete markets that we've talked about through the quarter, but still very confident that we'll inch up from where we ended the quarter here slightly. Well, and then maybe I could ask you a more philosophical question on AspenTech.\nI know at this point it announced its guidance for FY24, low double-digit ACV growth, and it agreed not to buy Micromine and announced a big repurchase. Are there any lessons learned as you and Antonio have worked together now for a little over a year and given AspenTech's FY24 guidance? Do you see a nice uptick in AZPN's contribution to your EPS in 2024? No, look, we continue to deliver on the synergy plan. I think that's point number one, not just in terms of pursuit of business, collaboration between the selling organizations, but most importantly, as I highlighted in the presentation around technology. And it's that technology tie-in that ultimately will differentiate our offerings in the marketplace. Number two, look, over the quarter, we did a lot of work together.\nI feel really good about the plan that AspenTech laid out, the way it was communicated yesterday. I thought it was very succinct and clear, and I think they'll execute very well as we go through the quarter. There's a lot of collaboration ongoing between our joint teams, and momentum continues to build a year into a little over a year into this.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, guys.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHi, Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nWell, I'd love to kind of dig in a little bit on backlog here. So flat sequentially, you highlighted the funnel of activity growing pretty materially here. So presumably, the conversion rate starts to pick up a little bit here. Do you think we're sort of in this backlog zone for a while? I think a lot of your other peers out there in multis are starting to dip into backlog with lead time normalization. Just wondering where you guys sit on that or anything you'd want to call out for the next few quarters.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHey, Josh. Yeah, we certainly expect the backlog to come down a few hundred million to Q4. It's important to note that it's year-over-year. At the end of the year, we expect that to be up a little over double digits. So yes, the supply chain easing has certainly helped, but as we look ahead, we see that backlog coming down a little bit in Q4.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Then just kind of going back to Nigel's question, maybe thinking about some of the factors, whether it's 2024 or maybe more broadly than that on mix, seems like with a lot of these large projects, we're going to see more KOB1, which I think maybe in the older days of Emerson was a bigger mix headwind. But how do you guys think about that now, given the change in project composition, etc.?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah, I think first off, I think just to add to what we said, relayed to Nigel, the KOB3 business performance has been very strong. Right now, we're running at 65% plus KOB3 rates with strong performance in North America. So that has really contributed to the outsized leverage we saw in the first three quarters. And we don't expect that to materially change in the next two to three quarters. But you are right, as our project backlog has built up and we see project shipments go into 2024, that will throttle leverage down to the mid-30s or high 30s rates we've guided to you in the past. So that's really a dynamic you should look for in 2024.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, and I think you're absolutely right. I think there's a fixed handle on the MRO and replacement business. We don't expect that. I think, Ram, you're absolutely right to change as we go through the year. There's a lot of positive activity there. So feel good about that mix despite a very robust capital project funnel.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Appreciate it. Best of luck.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Steve Tusa, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHello?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. The incremental is getting back to Nigel's question. I guess, given what happened this year, is there any view on how you view kind of the long-term trajectory on those incrementals? Can you just remind us of what your long-term view on that is and how that kind of plays out, and maybe how the mix may impact that over the next couple of years as perhaps the MRO stuff slows and the project stuff comes on?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, look, we guided in November, Steve, at 35 through the cycle. Obviously, we're in a very positive point in the cycle at this moment in time. And look, as we look at our mix of business, our tech, our geographical mix, as we go into November, we may assess that. But that's the guide that we put out last November. Obviously, we're outperforming that number today.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nAnd then what is the contribution from kind of price cost this year, just roughly?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Well, on price, in the quarter, we have nine points of volume and five points of price. Price will moderate as we go into the fourth, I think, for the year to three and a half, approaching four points of price in the full-year guide of 10% underlying sales.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nYep. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHi, guys. Good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI guess the KOB terminology just refuses to die, huh?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'm trying to kill it.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI am aware of that. So just a question on supply chain. Are you guys some of your competitors are talking about deflation or disinflation. Are you seeing an opportunity to extract discounts from your supply chain? Just trying to understand, right? People are talking about inflation subsiding. Are we going to see bottom-line benefit for a company like Emerson over the next 6 to 12 months?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nSimple answer is yes, Andrew. We look at, obviously, direct material, indirect material, and logistics. So we are going to see deflation or positive NMI or favorable NMI. We are seeing that already in the second half of this year and should see that continue into next year. So it will be favorable for us. What I will say, though, is if you go back to pre-COVID levels, logistics costs, for example, are already there. So we've seen a lot of the logistics benefit already come through. On the direct material front, particularly castings, machine parts, and electronics, we will see deflation in 2024 versus 2023, but still not back to pre-COVID levels. So maybe the opportunity there for us is continued deflation over the next several quarters as the market eases.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. And just a question on Aspen and Emerson. Can you just talk a little bit more about channel integration? Because we're hearing that you guys are driving Aspen and Emerson closer together, and the relationship is evolving. Just trying to understand how much upside do you think, or how much margin of safety there is, given that historically Emerson's sales force has been very, very commercial. You're incentivizing the salespeople. Seems like the relationship is going outside the initial channel. Just talk a little bit more about the opportunity. Thank you.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So you're spot on. I think over the last year and certainly in the last six months, the collaboration and the refinement of our go-to-market or joint go-to-market approach, whether it's a project or the white spaces, has certainly improved. Yes, you are correct. In certain markets, China, for example, we're collaborating a lot more in terms of having the channels work together. Incentive plans for both channels to support each other have been put in place, and that's really stimulating the right behavior, if you will, as both teams go out and pursue competitive displacement opportunities or Aspen, for example, selling on our DeltaV installed base. So yes, I think we'll continue to evolve and progress that. We're being very careful, and we're taking it market by market and doing what makes sense.\nI don't think there is a one-size-fits-all approach to every market, but certainly the collaboration and the incentives for sales organizations to collaborate have improved over the last six months.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Chris Snyder, UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. And congrats on a strong quarter. I guess I want to follow up on some of the prior conversation and communication on margins. If our MASRAI to guide seems to imply a pretty material sequential decline in margins into Q4 despite a step up in revenue, I guess, is that right? And what's driving that? Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. We will see a decline in margin in Q4. And if you think about Q3, that was driven by price and leverage; both of those things will be a little bit lower in Q4. As we mentioned, the pricing for the full year will be about 4 relative to the 5 in Q4 or in Q3, rather. And the mix will also have an effect there as we close out the year.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. I appreciate that. And then just maybe I was looking for some more color on the pipeline of big process projects. There's some concern in the market that with oil and gas kind of commodities down pretty well off the high, and that includes LNG, that there could be some slowdown or pressure on these projects. Seem to have really good momentum on there. So can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing there and particularly on the traditional energy and the LNG side? Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. I'll make a couple of comments, and if Ram wants to add color here.\nLook, the bulk of what we're seeing is gas. It's not oil. Where we do see activity in the oil, it's around sustainability, conversions, carbon capture, etc., and emissions reduction. But it's the gas activity that I think is very relevant. And that is entirely tied to Europe, to energy security and affordability. And we have not seen any slowdown in the activity. As a matter of fact, an acceleration through the quarter in terms of funding processes. There are seven projects currently out of nine funded and moving forward aggressively. And we've booked seven of the nine in seven of the nine already. So I haven't seen any evidence, and we have not felt within the business any evidence of any potential pullback in the gas infrastructure buildout or LNG infrastructure buildout. Ram?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. And just to add to that, as it relates to our traditional markets outside of LNG, as Lal mentioned, chemical is another area where we see continued momentum on projects, certainly in markets like the Middle East, US, and China. In terms of our true traditional energy business, FPSO activity in Brazil, Guyana, and Asia still continues to be good and moving forward. And then, obviously, as we've said, activities in metals and mining, life sciences, and nuclear continue to progress. So the funnel is diversified. That's what we like about the funnel. And it's not really dependent outside of LNG, not really dependent on one large market. And we feel very confident that on the LNG side, particularly in Qatar and in the US and East Africa, those projects will move forward.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you for all that color. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, I appreciate the spotlight you put on the battery value chain. We see this as linked to the whole array of these powerful mega projects that are going on now. In fact, battery is one of the biggest there. Just can you give us, and it's all tied to the reshoring, nearshoring phenomenon, give us a sense of what kind of win rates you're seeing there within the battery, but also on other projects. There's more than 50 different projects over $1 billion. Just if you cut across those, where else are you winning, like in the semiconductor side, other automation projects, and so forth?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, Deane, I'm happy to. I'll start with LNG, which has been very important. We're winning at a rate higher than 50% so far. Feel really good about continued differentiation in the marketplace and really becoming a de facto automation supplier there. In the hydrogen space, at 50% right now in terms of win rate to the funnel. Across the battery ecosystem, feel very, very strong that very, very confident that that sits in the 45% to 55% range as well. In fields like life sciences, it's much higher.\nThat is due to the very strong position of DeltaV and the various instrumentation technologies that we bring to bear. Overall, feel really good about the execution to the projects in the funnel. The pursuits are funded by internal teams. There's multiple varying calling points between engineering companies, end users, and EPs and contractors. It occurs at all levels within our organization, from Ram and I down into the card-carrying salespeople.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood to hear. Then second question would be for Mike. Just share with us some of the actions on the working capital side. There was really good free cash flow in the quarter. I would imagine you're still in this sort of interim period prior to NADI, where there's only so much you can do on the working capital side. But just give us a sense of what actions, near term, how that translates into free cash flow for the year and then into early 2024.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Deane. We have been really focused on inventory with the supply chain challenges. And we've seen some improvement, and we expect to see some continued improvement as we move into the Q4 around inventory. On receivables, with 14% growth, there's going to be a growth in receivables. I'll tell you that DSOs have stayed flat, and the execution there has been really, really good. If we look ahead, we're expecting for Q4 operating cash flow around $800 to 900 million and CapEx around $150 million, which should put us in around $2.2 to 2.3 billion for the year. I feel good about the actions that we're taking. There's been a strong focus on inventory with a backdrop of the supply chain moving around and settling, which is good. But that's been our focus.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nJust to add to that, the past due performance has continued to come down on the receivable side, which has been really helpful as well.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Just let's be clear, a growth in accounts receivable is a high-quality problem.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nIt's true.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next week. Next question will be from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I apologize if this was addressed. I was on a little late. But Lal, can you just give us your updated thoughts on how we're progressing towards regulatory approvals on National Instruments? And I know your view on 2024 was more subdued than where the street consensus was, but they did post some soft orders here in Q2. So just any thoughts on maybe the trajectory of that business as you work towards close?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah, Jeff. Yes, I did cover it in my script, but I'd be happy to repeat the key points. So on the regulatory, we have HSR approval, and all the filings have been made. Some already obviously obtained. So we feel very confident on the timeline to close in the first half of our fiscal 2024.\nIn terms of the business performance, look, it's largely playing out as we built into our model. Orders are down 17% end of the Q. That's largely driven by weakness in semiconductor and discrete, but we expect that to improve as the calendar year goes on. And that's how we've built into the business case. Having said that, Jeff, they had another record quarter. Their sales were up 5% year-over-year. The profitability continued to improve and is very strong, particularly GPs at very high level. So we feel excellent about the execution in the business, and we'll continue to stay close on our collaboration to be in our integration planning so that we can hit the ground running on day one.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. And then a few things I did here on the Q&A was a lot of discussion here on margin, leverage, mix, and etc. Just kind of drilling in on price costs specifically. I would imagine we're maybe at or near kind of peak positive gap on that metric. I just wonder if you'd opine on that. And maybe more importantly, though, my question is your ability to kind of maintain a positive spread between price and cost as we kind of look forward here the next several quarters.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. Yeah. Ram, why don't you give a question?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson\n\nYeah. So I think we're very confident in maintaining price cost green going into next year. However, price cost in terms of margin point contribution or the spread will be lower as we go forward. I mean, we've had an exceptionally good year here in terms of price performance and obviously NMI coming down in the second half. That'll continue. I mean, we will be green price cost, but the margin point contribution from it will be lower in 2024, which will have an impact on leverage rates.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Understand. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Tommy Moll, Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Hi, Tommy. Well, I think it was a quarter ago, maybe before you called out some of the softening on the discrete side. That was originally, I think, in Europe, primarily Germany, but then you highlighted some evolving trends in the US and Asia as well. Can you give us any more insight there?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. We saw that develop through the quarter, Tommy. You're absolutely right. A quarter ago, we talked about weakness that we began to see, particularly in automotive and in packaging OEMs, which, as you know, in Germany, not only serve the German market, but export throughout the world. That did spread into the United States and into parts of Asia. That developed through the quarter that drove more weakness in that discrete business, which, again, makes sense from a cycle perspective for us, but that really developed over the last three months.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens",
    "content2": "Thank you. I appreciate it. Lal, I also wanted to ask about culture. It's something that you've highlighted throughout your entire tenure as CEO. At the same time, pro forma for NATI, you'll have a much larger organization, including pieces that had their own cultures before they were folded into Emerson. So, situate us on that journey and give us some insight into what the consolidated approach will be once your portfolio is more mature.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate the question, Tommy. And as you know, that's pillar number one and continues to be pillar number one for our organization. We're very excited about the journey we're on. As you know, culture is not something that you change immediately, but you have to journey. And there's been a lot done across Emerson. What I particularly am excited about is the culture that exists today at National Instruments. It is something that is familiar to us. It is a very attractive place to work, a culture based around learning, curiosity. And that is felt in every engagement that we've had with that team.\nThey have moved ahead in many of the dimensions that we are looking to do here at Emerson, and we're going to be learning from NI and applying a lot of their lessons to what we implement here in our company. So I think there's an accretion there and an accelerator there from what they've done. But at the end of the day, it's a company of engineers who are curious, who lean forward, and think about tech in differentiated ways. And that's essentially who we are today.\n\nTommy Moll\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nThank you, Lal. I'll turn it back.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question will be from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one more just related to the price cost dynamic. I think pretty clear in terms of what you're seeing on the cost opportunity side, but just overall how you think that filters through on the price side. So I appreciate that still a positive margin spread, even if narrowing. But in conversations you're having, are you seeing a little bit more discussion around that? Are you seeing areas where price is actually moving down?\n\nMike Baughman\n\nCFO, Emerson\n\nNo, we expect price to remain positive. The magnitude of the price will be obviously, it won't be as positive as we saw in the inflationary times of the last couple of years. But our automation business, we have a leadership position in all the markets we play in. We bring a lot of technology to our customers. Obviously, KOB3, which is the replacement cycle, is 65% of our sales.\nSo we'll be positive price going into 2024, even as we execute on the favorable deflation that we will see on purchases like electronics, castings, machine parts.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. And then also wanted to circle back a couple of comments on nearshoring and I think kind of a broadening out maybe of the trends there. And so if you could expand on that a little bit and just touch on sort of the evolution of what you've seen, maybe kind of led in North America, but just sort of what inning you think we're on. Are you seeing any kind of stabilization in those trends in the US, but you're seeing kind of growth budding in other regions? And so if you can touch on those regions and verticals a little bit more.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nI'll say a few comments and ask Ram to add a little color as well. Look, I think we're in early innings, certainly early innings in terms of the infrastructure, chips, and nearshoring activities. And it's broad-based. It's driven clearly in the EV battery value chain that's described in life sciences, semiconductor, which will benefit National Instruments significantly as well. But it's Australia. It's Europe. It's the United States with very robust activity across all world areas. But I have to say, based on just the pace of activity, I do believe there are many innings yet to be played here.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. Got it. Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes our conference today. Thank you for attending this presentation. You may now disconnect."

Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Emerson Electric Co\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for Emerson's Q2 Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer Frank Dellaquila, and Chief Operating Officer Ram Krishnan. Also joining us today is Mike Baughman who was announced earlier this morning as our Chief Financial Officer, effective 10 May. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the Slide presentation which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO Lal Karsanbhai for opening remarks.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThank you, Colleen, and good morning. Please turn to Slide three. I'd like to begin by thanking the global Emerson team for tremendous performance, our Board of Directors, and shareholders for the trust that you place in us. It has been a busy first 26 months as CEO. As we reinvented Emerson, the Q2 performance was exceptional. It was a quarter in which we significantly advanced our strategic agenda across the three dimensions of our value creation model. First, culture. In the last two months we announced two important leadership changes. Vidya Ramnath was named as the company's Chief Marketing Officer replacing Kathy Button Bell who had a distinguished career at Emerson and put Emerson's brand on the map while working for three different CEOs. Vidya is the right person to accelerate our journey as a pure play automation company.\nShe brings deep technical knowledge and customer exposure, is an engineer, and for the last four years has led Emerson's Middle East and Africa business. We believe this is highly differentiating move for us as a company.\nSecondly, this morning we announced Frank's planned retirement and Mike Baughman as Emerson's CFO. I'll say a few more words about this later in the presentation. Lastly, we completed our first digital employee engagement survey. We heard from 85% of our global employee base and received a high quartile net engagement score. This gives us a stake in the ground and our great perspective on the areas of strength and opportunities to better the talent experience at Emerson. Second, the portfolio. We will be finalizing the climate transaction in the current quarter. The CEO for the Jordan venture has been named Ross Shuster, and we are excited by what his leadership and experience brings to the business. I'd like to thank Jamie Froedge for the work he did in the business and for his contributions over 16 years of service at Emerson.\nIn addition, we signed the definitive agreement to acquire National Instruments. We're very excited about the company, the technology, and most importantly, the people.\nThis is an important point. The large portfolio moves are now complete. As an investor, you now have clarity that an investment in a share of Emerson is an investment in the leading global automation company serving a diversified set of end markets with a high growth, high profitability, and cash flow. Cohesive and differentiated tech stack made up of Intelligent Devices, control, and software led by AspenTech. Our focus on a go forward basis as we did this quarter will be on creating value with this tremendous company. Lastly, our third pillar execution. None of the work we've done would have been possible without it. The phenomenal results and momentum we have in the business is a testament to the quality of our global teams and to the strength of the Emerson management system.\nUnderlying orders were up 7% with late cycle process markets continuing to exhibit strong demand. Hybrid also remains robust driven by reshoring investments globally. From a world area perspective, Americas' orders led with China returning to growth as expected.\nAs we look to the remainder of the year, we still feel confident in continued mid single digit order growth. The strong demand and steadily improving supply chain environment enabled 14% underlying sales growth in the quarter, well above our expectations. All world areas were up double digits, led by the Americas, up 15%. Intelligent Devices and Software and Control were also both up double digits. This strong sales performance and the continued operational execution of our teams led to 53% operating leverage in the quarter excluding AspenTech. Favorable impacts from mix and price cost also drove a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted segment EBITDA to 24.6%. Adjusted EPS was $1.09, beating the midpoint of guidance by $0.11, again driven by the strong sales and operational performance. This is a 25% increase versus Q2 of 2022.\nFree Cash Flow was up 64% year-over-year and up 23% year to date, which is on track to meet our full year expectations.\nTurning to Slide four, our value creation priorities and growth initiatives around innovation and secular growth platforms that we outlined at our Investor conference in November 2022 are yielding meaningful results. First, Emerson was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of America's most innovative companies. The recognition is a testament to our innovation history and dedication from our employees to create leading technology and software for our customers. We are extremely excited to be recognized for this award and are working continuously to accelerate our innovation engine for future growth.\nSimilarly, Emerson continues to differentiate as a leader in growth markets like energy, transition metals, mining, and software. In Q2, Emerson was awarded the software and automation contract for Intermountain Power Agency's Renewed Power Plant. The Utah project transforms a retiring coal-fired power plant into a clean energy plant running on hydrogen. At first, the plant will use a mix of 30% hydrogen, 70% natural gas before transitioning to 100% hydrogen by 2045. The hydrogen will be supplied by the Mitsubishi Power Advanced Clean Energy Production and Storage Hub, another greenfield project that Emerson was awarded in 2022. When complete, the Intermountain project will supply six Western states with carbon-free power, a critical step towards a net zero world with our integrated end-to-end renewables and power generation platform.\nEmerson was chosen because of our industry expertise and proven experience in hydrogen and complex projects. Secondly, Emerson and AspenTech were jointly selected to automate and optimize the Golden Triangle Polymers facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. The $8.5 billion project is a sister facility to QatarEnergy and Chevron Phillips Ras Laffan project that we highlighted in Q1. Emerson will provide its leading DeltaV control system and intelligent devices, and AspenTech will provide its leading simulation software. This technology will allow the facility to operate with approximately 25% lower greenhouse gas emissions than similar projects in the US and Canada. This is a great example of the differentiating strength of Emerson and AspenTech. Turning to Slide five, we remain energized and excited by our recently announced acquisition of National Instruments.\nNational Instruments will expand our leading automation business into the attractive test and measurement space and provide important industry diversification into discrete markets. NI's leading portfolio of technology and software are well positioned to capitalize on secular trends within semiconductor and electric vehicles, and we expect the transaction to be accretive to our long term underlying growth inclusive of $165 million of synergies by the end of year five. The transaction meets the financial criteria we have communicated. We will work to complete the customary regulatory and closing conditions and expect to close in H1 2024. We had the opportunity to meet the extended management team and to do a global town hall with NI employees last week while visiting Austin. From that meeting we came away even more confident in the potential opportunities of our combined company.\nThe technology is differentiated and has ample room to expand and the talent, well, it's simply exceptional. But most importantly, I was energized by the warm reception we received from the leadership team and all the employees we met. In a way, I am proud to be an NIer now as well.\nPlease turn to Slide six. The past 26 months have been fast paced and an exciting journey for Emerson. We moved from a $17 billion two platform business to a cohesive $16 billion automation leader. It took a lot of hard work to transform this business, and we now have an outstanding opportunity to create value for shareholders. It is a portfolio that is exposed to secular growth trends that are expected to drive growth for years to come, and we remain committed to our 4 to 7% through the cycle underlying growth target. Our new portfolio is higher margin at approximately 49% gross profit and 23% adjusted segment EBITDA margin. Our industry mix is more diversified than two years ago, focused on automation, and with the Discrete Markets now our second largest customer end market.\nWhile we will continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions, we're now turning our focus to executing the strategy we laid out at investor conference and delivering the synergies we have committed to for AspenTech and NI.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Emerson and our board are committed to ongoing board refreshment, and yesterday we had the privilege of announcing two new board members to our Board of Directors. Leticia Goncalves is the President of Global Foods for ADM and a member of the company's Executive Council. As part of ADM, Bayer, and Monsanto, Leticia has held roles in digital solutions, commercial operations, international management, and technology development and is a longtime advocate and driver of diversity and inclusion. Her experience in these areas and accelerating change make her an excellent addition to our board. Leticia is originally from Brazil. She's a chemical engineer and has a tremendous passion for innovation. Speaking of innovation, Jim McKelvey is a successful entrepreneur who founded Block, Invisibly, and FINTOP Capital.\nHe brings a unique innovation focused perspective to Emerson and will serve as a key collaborator as we continue to accelerate innovation and invest in technology and engineering. Jim has expertise in many areas including software, cloud, and cybersecurity which will benefit Emerson as we provide customers with leading digital solutions. They are energized, and so are we, and we are excited to have both Leticia and Jim join our Board of Directors. Before I turn the call over to Frank, please turn to Slide eight.\nI would like to congratulate Frank for a distinguished career of over 32 years at Emerson and the past 14 years as CFO. Frank, I met you 28 years ago and it has been an honor to be your colleague. Please know that you created a legacy here at Emerson. We could not have accomplished what we did over the past 26 months without you. I would not have been able to lead this company without your wisdom, confidence, and support. You made us better. You made me better. Thank you for the lasting impression you left on me and the impact you made on all of us.\nI'm also excited to announce Mike Baughman as CFO of Emerson, effective May 10th. Mike has over 35 years of experience in finance operations across Baxter, Emerson, of course, and PwC. I'm excited about what Mike brings to the role and please join me in welcoming him. Mike, congratulations.\n\nMike Baughman\n\nIncoming CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThanks, Lal. And thanks to you and the board for giving me the opportunity to serve as Emerson's next Chief Financial Officer. I'm very excited to get into the role. Good morning, everyone. I've had the opportunity to meet several of our investors and analysts, and I'm looking forward to meeting more of you and working with you in the future. And to my Emerson colleagues listening in, thank you for a fantastic quarter. As Lal just talked about, it's been a productive 26 months with respect to reshaping our portfolio, and we're on track to achieve what we set out to do. The impressive result is a more cohesive $16 billion automation company expected to grow 4 to 7% through the cycle with peer leading margins and a more diversified end market exposure.\nI think of the portfolio transformation as a great start, and now we get to operate in this new environment. Execution has always been a hallmark of Emerson, and we're building on that to focus on accelerating profitable growth, integrating NI, and growing our cash flows as the supply chain normalizes. I certainly expect successful execution in these areas to result in increased shareholder value.\nWhile I'm excited about our future, transitioning to the CFO role is a little bittersweet for me personally. Frank was a major reason I joined Emerson a little over five years ago. During that time I have come to know Frank as a great finance professional and more importantly, a wonderful person. I'm confident we'll have a smooth transition over the coming months.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThanks, Mike. Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nWell, Mike, thank you so much for the kind words. When I showed up here 32 years ago, I never didn't really know what to expect. And I never could have imagined the opportunities that I would have, the things I would get to do, and above all, the people I would have the privilege to work with. The last 13 years have truly been a privilege leading a world class finance organization who I respect and I trust implicitly. Never let me down and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. The last two years working with Lal, Ram, the people in this room, and our extended team on the portfolio transformation have been truly special and just a wonderful capstone to my career, and I will always be grateful for that opportunity.\nThank you.\nLal. I'm truly grateful for that. It's been a heck of a run. Emerson is well positioned for the future. This is a perfect time to turn it over to Mike, who I've come to know well as a person respect as a leader over the last five years. I am confident he's going to provide the right leadership for the challenges we have again. The future is very, very bright, and I'm so happy to have been a small part of it. I've enjoyed working with all of you over the last two years on the phone with our analysts and our investors, and I couldn't think of a better way to go out, and I'm very grateful, and I just am so thankful for that. Thanks, everybody, and there is no crying on earnings calls, so we're going to get on.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThanks, Frank. NTU on Chart 9.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nOh. Okay. Here we go.\nGood morning again, everyone. Please turn to Slide nine. Our Q2 financial results were outstanding, reflecting our strong end markets and operating execution. Lal summarized the results for you, so I'll provide a bit more color. Additional details are in the press release, and in the Slides in the appendix to this presentation. Underlying sales growth exceeded our expectations at 14%. All world areas in both business groups were up double digits, reflecting the strength in our end markets, our positioning in them, and our geographic presence. Demand was broad-based, with late-cycle process markets up high teens, and hybrid markets also up double digits in the quarter. Discrete demand has begun to moderate after several quarters of strong growth, but sales were still strong in the quarter, up high single digits. Safety and productivity returned to growth, up 3% in the quarter.\nNet sales also were up 14% for the quarter with a 3-point drag from currency, which was essentially offset by acquisitions and divestitures. We did close our Russia divestiture in March, and we now report the business we had on the divestiture line of our net sales bridge. Our businesses continue to realize significant price in the quarter. Price contributed approximately $150 million and 5 points of growth. Backlog also grew $300 million, reflecting the strong orders backlog of approximately $6.9 billion to end the quarter. AspenTech revenue was below expectations for reasons they explained on their call, and I'll briefly summarize those here. Please keep in mind that AspenTech reports revenue under ASC 606, so the factors affecting GAAP revenue are complex, and as explained on AspenTech's earnings call, there were three factors in play.\nThe first was longer than planned project execution in the OSI business, which pushed out the recognition of project revenue milestones. This is mainly a timing-related dynamic, and we continue to see strong demand trends from the power transmission and distribution market. AspenTech also experienced shorter-term contract lengths within the SSE business. Overall, the shift from perpetual to term contracts is progressing well, but some customers are choosing shorter contract lengths than we expected, and that has a direct impact on upfront revenue recognition. And lastly, AspenTech is seeing some weakness in OpEx spend in the bulk chemical market, which is impacting heritage AspenTech. For further clarification, Emerson's chemical exposure is more diversified across both bulk and specialty chemicals, and both OpEx and CapEx spend.\nAdjusted Segment EBITDA margin improved 320 basis points. Leverage excluding AspenTech exceeded 50%. Strong sales growth, favorable business and world area mix, and margin accretive price cost all reflect exceptional execution by operations and contributed to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 25% to $1.09, and we'll discuss that on the next chart. Lastly, Free Cash Flow was up 64% versus the prior year quarter and up 23% year to date. The strong earnings growth and slight improvement in working capital contributed to that growth. AspenTech contributed $129 million to Free Cash Flow. Please turn to Slide 10.\nMost importantly, 14% underlying sales growth and 53% segment level operating leverage contributed 26% of our EPS growth quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-over-quarter of that AspenTech contributed $0.04. Currency was a $0.03 headwind, and other items, mainly income tax because we had favorable discrete items last year, were a net $0.05 headwind. The reduced share count resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase that we completed in the Q1 contributed $0.04 to earnings per share. So again overall adjusted EPS grew 25% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 11 and we'll talk about our revised 2023 market outlook. We continue to see broad-based strength in most key end markets. In particular, we've updated our expectations process and hybrid markets.\nWe have increased our expectation for process sales to a high single digit to low double digit growth range on the back of continued energy, energy transition, and chemical market momentum. This market was strong in Q2 and our customers continue to signal favorable spending plans for the rest of the year. Within chemicals, we continue to see strong CapEx spending, particularly in the US, the Middle East, and Asia. Within the hybrid space, life sciences, and metals and mining continue to be strong and we expect this market to grow high single digits in 2023. Reshoring continues to be a prevalent topic among our customers and we expect near- and longer-term benefits from this trend. As I mentioned, discrete demand is beginning to moderate as these earlier cycle markets have been strong for the last two years.\nWe are seeing this first in Europe as industrial production is affected by rising input costs. Still, we continue to hear optimism about spend on factory automation and productivity improvements from our customers. Please turn to Slide 10 and we'll talk about our revised guidance.\nBased on the market strength I described and our continued expectation of mid single digit orders growth, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the year. For 2023, underlying sales growth has been increased to 8.5 to 10% year-on-year and net sales to 9 to 10.5%. We expect Intelligent Devices to be near the top of this range, in Software and Control nearer to the lower end. We are also increasing our expectation for segment operating leverage based on the strong first half achievement and our second half outlook. Continued sales strength, favorable price-cost, and continued operational performance give us confidence in increasing this guide. We now expect segment operating leverage to be in the low to mid 40% range.\nExcluding AspenTech, adjusted EPS guidance has been raised to a range of $4.15 to 4.25, up $0.15 at the bottom of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint. AspenTech is expected to contribute approximately $0.25 to this improved guidance. The strength in core Emerson operations is more than offsetting the reduced AspenTech expectation, which is incorporated into our guidance. Free Cash Flow is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion for the year, of which AspenTech contributes approximately $300 million. This is consistent with our prior guidance of approximately 100% Free Cash Flow conversion on GAAP net earnings and is equivalent to approximately 85% on an adjusted net earnings basis. In the future, we will express Free Cash Flow conversion on an adjusted net earnings basis consistent with our other key non-GAAP metrics, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share.\nThe business we have today has strong cash conversion characteristics that we expect to convert over time at an average of 100% on an adjusted basis. We now expect AspenTech's adjusted segment EBITDA to be slightly below 40% for the year. As a reminder, Emerson's Q3 is AspenTech's seasonally strongest quarter due to the timing of contract renewals. We believe the operating items that affected AspenTech's Q3 results reflect transitory operating and market challenges. We are as confident as ever about the long-term strategic opportunity afforded by our ownership of AspenTech and in the $110 million year-five synergy commitment that we made.\nAs a reminder, all of this guidance excludes the impact of Climate Technologies operations, interest income, and the financial impact of the sale, which we expect to close, we hope, 31 May. In the appendix we have provided information on the post closing financial reporting treatment of Climate Technologies.\nBriefly, to turn to the third quarter. That guide also reflects the strong outlook for the year. We expect underlying sales growth of 10% to 12%. We expect leverage to be in the mid- to high 40s in the quarter and adjusted EPS to be between $1.07 and 1.11. This represents an 18% increase at the midpoint versus prior year. We should point out, for context, that last year's Q3 was negatively impacted by China shutdowns and serious supply chain challenges around electronics, which at the time we estimated reduced third quarter sales by approximately $150 million, with the China impact being pushed into the fourth quarter. Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back now to the operator to open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, thank you. At this time we will begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star then two. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. This morning's first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nGood morning Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nSo, Frank, congratulations and thank you, and Mike, welcome. So, I guess my first question is a lot of debate with investors about the impact of improving lead times on orders backlog and Free Cash Flows. Clearly you're starting releasing working capital, but if you're releasing working capital, perhaps you're ordering less stuff. And if you're ordering less stuff, maybe somebody else is ordering less stuff. How do you think this dynamic will play out over the next six to 12 months?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nWell, I'll start off with some comments just on the underlying environment which we're still optimistic about. As you heard on the call, Andrew, mid single digit order run rates. We came out of the quarter at 7% and expect that range to continue through the remainder of the year. So the demand environment based on our visibility is strong, and as Frank outlined correctly, I think there's some puts and takes out there and we're watching those carefully. But as a whole we feel very good about that. Having said that, we have a very robust backlog as well. We did build backlog in the quarter and we continue to work through that. Which gives me further confidence obviously in the performance of the company for the second half.\nNaturally, with supply chain challenges largely alleviated, of course there are still a few issues out there, but largely alleviated. Lead times have started to come down. But we haven't seen that reflected in any slowdown in orders. Very much as you saw, quarter over quarter and sequentially, our order pace continued to be very consistent there. Ram, anything to add?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, I would say again Andrew, I think from a lead time perspective, distribution for example is less than 20% of our overall sales. So you know, and frankly even with distributors, as our lead times have come down, we haven't seen any change in ordering patterns. Our KOB 3 business, which is the other piece that is lead time dependent, continues to be strong. So no fundamental change for us as it relates to ordering patterns from our customers as lead times across all categories of products for us have come down. Now I know others have mentioned that, but to date we haven't seen the impact.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat answer. Thank you. And just maybe a follow up question on aligning Aspen and Emerson sales channel. You guys clearly highlighted golden triangle success of going to market together. You reformed the synergies. But I guess the question I have, as you work closer with Aspen, what are the opportunities to improve.\nVisibility at Emerson? Right, because you have access now to a lot of CIOs, but also what are the opportunities at Aspen to benefit from deep and broad relationships that Emerson has with their key clients? For example, in the chemical space. Right, you said our relationships are much broader. What can you do to improve visibility at Aspen in key verticals? Thank you.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nIt's a good question, and it goes back to the heart of the commercial agreement, the very robust commercial agreement that we have with AspenTech. There is world area alignment in leadership, there is sales force alignment, and incentives, and very honestly joint pursuit in two areas, capital projects, which is the example that I share with you. And then a very robust analysis on an industry-by-industry basis of the white space opportunities that exist particularly for our control system and for AspenTech. And that's more of a systematic approach by the selling organizations, but one that will prove to be and is proving to be quite a large opportunity as well. Ram,\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nyeah. And just to add, I think the customer landscape is really the way we really want to drive more ACV for AspenTech. Certainly the momentum on projects is there early. But as we shared with you before, 70% of the control systems that we have, DeltaV, don't have Level 3 software capability at many of our customers. 9,000 of those are in markets like life sciences, metals, and mining. So those are the unique type of opportunities. The AMS systems that we have where we can bring Aspen, that's the approach we're taking through our commercial agreement. They're very, very geographically focused as well. Where we look at markets where Aspen doesn't have the strength and that's really where a lot of the effort is being put. So we'll see that benefit come through. It's three quarters in. Obviously the relationship.\nThe momentum is early on projects, but more will come as it relates to the white space that I described over time.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI also want to wish Frank all the best. It's been great working with you and congrats to Mike. So my first question is maybe take us through what you're seeing on the discrete side with some of the demand moderating, you know, how did it progress through the quarter? Is it isolated to some specific verticals or geographies? Yes, we are hearing elsewhere slowing in Europe, especially on the chemical side. But. We appreciate hearing the color there, please. Thanks.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYes, Deane, Ron here. From a discrete order activity now, the discrete business from a sales perspective, we had good strong growth in the quarter, 9.5%, close to 10% growth in the quarter. From a sales perspective, which was driven by backlog reduction, orders did go slightly negative this year. This quarter, I should say, primarily driven by slowdown in Europe. Frankly, we haven't seen much of a slowdown in North America, but a slight slowdown in Europe, particularly in Germany and the segment around machine builders. We do serve the machine builder segment in Germany, which is both domestic German market as well as these machine builders export. So that's really probably the one segment. A little bit of slowdown in the UK frankly. Asia is holding up and China remains good. So that's the color.\nWe do expect discrete to get into tougher comparisons as we get through the second half of the year. We expect orders to remain negative before they turn positive into 2024.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Thank you. Then just a follow-up. I also just want to hear Frank one more time here on the Free Cash Flow difference between GAAP and adjusted this year, that difference, how much of that is either working capital needs given supply chain or is it more from climate. Thanks.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nNo. I mean, there is none of the difference. The difference is simply the calculation, the denominator. I mean, we're just talking about the $2.2 billion guide of Free Cash Flow and whether we use GAAP earnings or we use adjusted earnings as a denominator. That's the difference between the conversion ratio. There's no difference at all in the calculation of the cash flow itself.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, everybody. I'll echo what the other fellows, and I'm sure others, will say, and congrats to both Frank and Mike on the changes here. So I don't want to fixate on AspenTech. We can do that later perhaps, but I will anyways. The bulk chemical OpEx, is it typically that volatile? Is this something that they've experienced in the past and perhaps you might see in the future or is this an unusual circumstance?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nNo, I think the bulk chemical dynamic because, I mean, you see many of the chemical customers say at the end of the day with a little bit of slowing demand there and their utilization rates being optimized. The portion of the AspenTech business which typically gets impacted is their manufacturing and supply chain software suite. So, in terms of new purchases or new contracts around that, which we have built into the forecast, that's where we're seeing slowdown. So that's pretty normal. Obviously, refining for them continues to remain strong. Upstream and midstream continues to remain good. It's really the manufacturing and supply chain suite and bulk chemicals where we have seen the slowdown, and we've seen that in the past when the large chemical customers slow down spending on the OpEx side.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And guys, assuming your stock price works, and I know AspenTech is down quite a bit from its highs, but is. There any interest in? I know there's some restrictions, but those things can always be discussed in taking an even larger stake in, in the entity and perhaps over time integrating it fully into Emerson.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nNo. Scott, this is Lal. Good morning. No, look, we're still very committed to the model. That we set forward a year ago closed nearly a year ago. Now it works. We're seeing the commercial value, we're working the technology piece as well. And like I've said in the past, it's at a point in time that changes, and we have an impetus to then address that through. A change in the ownership structure of the vehicle. We'll think about it then, but not at this point. And then furthermore, as you know and you noted, we are in a standstill period for another calendar year from now.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYou got me so excited, I spilled and dumped my coffee, Lal. So I'll pass it on to the next guy. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Congratulations, Frank and Mike. Hello. Could you give us a little more color into your incremental margin performance both for Q2 and 2023? I know the new Emerson is supposed to record higher incrementals well into the 30s, but what's changed for Emerson in 2023 that's allowing you to record low to mid-40s, over 50% in Q2. Is it mostly the 5% price that Frank mentioned? And much improved supply chain environment is maybe underlying Emerson able to sustain incrementals in the 40% ex Aspen over the longer term. And how you're thinking about price versus cost moving forward?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nWe certainly. I'll let Ram add some operating color as we went through the quarter, but we certainly believe. In the strong guidance that we put together on the 40 leverage for the full year, given the early performance in the first six months. Look, there are a lot of things that were positive. Obviously, the execution was exceptional. I think the operating executives in the businesses performed very, very well, in fact.\nThe volume was important, as we noted, growing the underlying sales at 14%. But furthermore, mix and price, cost were beneficial as well in the quarter. So a lot of things went our way there. But honestly, working within the management system that we've designed is a very important parameter that enables our businesses to perform at a very high level here. Ram.\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYes. I mean, other dynamics that certainly went our way is strong North America in the quarter, strong performance in our instrumentation and final control businesses, and the leverage we got there. So, dynamics are on mix. Certainly, the price call element that Lal mentioned. But, fundamentally, the 14% sales growth in the quarter does help leverage. So, all of those dynamics went in our favor.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThat's helpful, guys. And then maybe you can give us a little more color into what you're seeing by region. I think China was relatively weak for you in Q1. It seems like it's better in Q2, I think, while you mentioned easy comparisons in Q3. So how are you thinking about regional demand moving forward for the rest of the year?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nReally good. It was a very robust quarter globally for us in terms of sales, performance, and very honestly orders. As Ram and, excuse me, Frank outlined. China flipped for us.\nIt was down in the mid-single digits a quarter ago. It was up both in orders high-single digits and in sales in the mid-single digits. So we feel very good, and we feel good about what we see in China for the remainder of the year as well. So that's a positive look. North America, very robust growth, broad strength, a lot of it driven by the nearshoring elements and core strength in hybrid and process with growth of 15-ish% in sales. Europe, that's been very honestly, Andy, the biggest surprise of the year. It continues to be very strong for us with growth in the mid-teens, 14% in the quarter in sales and orders that are very strong and very honestly highlighted by energy, sustainability, and life science investments.\nAnd then the rest of Asia, driven by India, Southeast Asia, and then an incredibly strong Middle East and Africa region as well, with significant investments in sustainability and LNG across the region. So at this point in time, with the exception of the discrete weaknesses that we've already talked through, continue to see very, very strong global. Momentum as we go through the quarter here into the rest of the year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate all the color.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThanks, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGuys, good morning.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nCongratulations again to both CFOs, outgoing and incoming.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nWhat was price capture in the quarter and what do you expect it to be for the year?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\n5%.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nIt was five points in the quarter. We expected to be 3 to 4% for the year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, great. And then, Lal. I'm just curious from, like, a governance perspective.\nThe AspenTech results, you know, there's a lot going on there. I guess at a high level, some of it sounds like execution on some of these contracts. You know, perhaps in the, I guess I call it integration phase of what they're doing, even though it's not really an acquisition by them. I guess it seems like that there were a couple things that surprised them about the assets that you guys are contributing. How does that conversation work, you know, in the boardroom there? Because those are like assets that you guys knew. I'm not sure how surprising that was to you, but it was clearly surprising to the market the way this has played out. So I'm just curious, like a little more color from your perspective on the integration that's going on there and perhaps.\nHow that discussion and how to move forward plays out when that type of thing happens.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, no, absolutely, Steve. I'll give you some color here. Maybe there's three or four here. Critical points.\nLet me first begin by saying that I continue to be, and we collectively continue to be, very optimistic about the business and the differentiation that it provides as a technology solution across a diverse customer base. That's very important. Secondly, the execution of both the commercial and the technology synergies is progressing ahead of pace. We have alignment across all selling organizations. The technology teams and I highlighted a capital project that we worked on, and we're working on many across the world, and we have a joint funnel of pursuits. So what happened in Q2, and I think there are important dimensions here to talk about. First, the company continues to perform extremely strongly. It's a Rule of 50 software business with ACV growth exceeding 11% and strong cash flow.\nBut there were three challenges in the quarter, and these were challenges that we have a robust communication process not just at the board level, but at an operating level. We speak with Antonio and Chantel, who's the CFO, on a regular basis. The first is shorter term contracts on subscriptions at SSE, which obviously was one of the assets that we contributed to. The assumption in the plan was on a three to four-year basis of subscriptions that was we converted or AspenTech converted those from perpetual license to subscription. The reality is that they came in more in the one-year level. So that had an impact on revenue recognition. Just the nature of that conversion journey and.\nA challenge, as those customers in that market space. Accept subscription contracts over the perpetual traditional licenses. The second you also referenced is OSI. It is a differentiated business in a high growth segment as you know, but the integration has been slower. It's a business that came with a heavy service component to it, and very honestly that migration and conversion ultimately from perp to sub on the software is taking longer than expected. But we continue to be jointly very optimistic about the business. The orders in the business are strong, and we will work through the next few quarters to execute there. And then lastly, as Ron described earlier, the heritage AspenTech business and the slowdown related to the bulk chemicals segment there. But having said all of that, look, the plan has been reset. It's embedded in our results here. It's embedded in the outlook that we provided in the guide and.\nThe investment is. I still believe there's a tremendous amount of value creation opportunity here for Emerson shareholders, and we continue to be very committed, and I think we have the processes both operating, which is CEO to CEO CFOs, and through the Emerson management process as best we can here, and through the board of directors in which. To manage and to be part of the conversations and discussions with that team.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAre you assuming a bounce back in your Q4 in those results?\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThanks for all the color too.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, of course. No, look, I think we've embedded their perspective, which they shared with their investors on their call into our guide.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Frank, it's hard to believe you've. Been CFO for 14 years. So, good one, congratulations and good luck in retirement. And Mike, congratulations. Yeah, thanks. Just on the. Just maybe picking up off Steve's question there. Maybe, just maybe this is a question to you, Frank. Maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces in the guide. Clearly the bulk of the uplift is driven by much better revenue conversion, margin expansion. But maybe some of the moving pieces. AspenTech, how's that changed in the guidelines? Maybe stock comp, any of the major discrete lumps would be helpful.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nWell, I mean the main driver is obviously the improved outlook for operations, the uplift in the sales as well as the operational execution, the strong price realization, all the things that drove the strong leverage in Q2 we expect to have in Q3 and throughout the rest of the year. So I mean that is mainly the story and that is strong enough to overcome the reduced AspenTech guide. I mean as was said, we essentially incorporate their guide into our numbers and you know, they took the guide down for the year. So we've overcome that headwind as we move from the February to the current guidance. And you know, those are, those are the main pieces\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nand that's what, $0.06. $0.07 mark-to-market on AspenTech.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nFor the year? Roughly, yeah. In that range, yes.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, great. Then just on the maybe, maybe picking up off Ram's comment on the installed base of DCS, you said 70% don't have Level 3 software capability. Does that precipitate an upgrade cycle? I know we've talked about upgrade cycles in the past, but are we at the threshold now where we might see an installed base upgrade cycle or is it more just patching around that with some of the capabilities around software?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nI don't know if we're planning for a major upgrade wave. I think it's more a disciplined approach with each one of our customers to address the optimization benefits, the APM benefits, and some of the capabilities that Aspen brings to improve the performance of the overall automation system that is installed in many of these customers. We're going across the board across industries, power and life sciences being the focus area. You know, everybody is very interested in digitally transforming their assets, and we're seeing more and more interest from our customers to launch digital transformation programs across the automation stack where level three software has an important role to play primarily around optimization on the manufacturing suite and then more the asset performance management and the reliability software on uptime of assets in their infrastructure. So that's the journey.\nI think you're going to see more and more of that. Sustainability is another area where software will get deployed. But I don't think it's a big wave. I think it's more a disciplined wave over time and we have the opportunity to drive it.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. Congrats to Frank and Mike. Frank, I think it's hard to believe you've been CFO for 14 years because until we got a new CEO we didn't have many opportunities to get to know you. The new structure is better. So congrats all around.\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThank you, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nYeah. A lot of ground covered. I just wanted to touch back on capital deployment and M&A. As you said, you know, the big moves are done, and that certainly makes sense. But you did indicate that you're working bolt-ons, and you know, it looks like you also maybe have a six-month gap or so between the climate proceeds and National Instruments closing. Just wonder how that might play out over that time frame. Is there room for some more share repurchase? Are there actionable bolt-ons that could be happening, you know, over the interim period, or just what we should expect there?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, I'll let Frank comment as well here. But no, look, we obviously work towards the closing of National Instruments over those six months aggressively. It may come sooner, we'll see. Depends on the regulatory approvals. That's going to be the key pacing items. As you know, Jeff, the bolt-ons, we work them aggressively within the businesses and some are competitive processes, others not. And we have two or three of those that we're looking at at any given point in time and we'll continue to do so. These are sub-billion-dollar purchase price type of deals and we have.\nA small number we're looking at right now and evaluating. And then look, we continue to be very committed to return cash to our shareholders, whether that's through the dividend or share repurchase. And as we go into 2024, we'll lay out what the appropriate plan there is and communicate that. Frank, anything to add?\n\nFrank Dellaquila\n\nOutgoing CFO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYes, Jeff. I wouldn't view share repurchase decisions in the context of the gap between closing Climate and closing NI. I would view it more broadly as part of the capital allocation strategy. I mean, after we close NI, we'll have a balance sheet that's well below 2x debt to EBITDA and a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. So we'll just continue to make those decisions in that context.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Then just back to chem, and I do understand you have a more diverse business than Aspen, but you know, why shouldn't we view this as an early warning sign of pressure in the core business in chem, and maybe just a little bit more color what you're seeing there, because there are obviously CapEx and profitability issues across a lot of that industry right now?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co",
    "content2": "Yeah. So, you know, for us, the capital cycle and chemical, particularly specialty chemical, is as good as we have seen it, particularly in Middle East, Asia Pacific, and ethylene and methanol investments in North America. So for us, we haven't seen the capital cycle slow. However, what Aspen is referencing is the OpEx spend in chemical customers as they throttle their production in response to slowing demand, and therefore that translates to MSC purchases. The manufacturing supply chain software purchases is really the dynamic that's impacting them. It's a small impact to them at this point, but given it's 18% of their sales mix, I think they've referenced that. But to be honest, we haven't really seen any KOB3 slowdown or KOB2 in chemical.\nAnd then certainly many of our major project wins to date that we have been sharing with you have been in the chemical petrochemical space, particularly in the emerging markets. At this point we don't see that as an inflection point or a slowdown in the industry, despite the higher feedstock costs.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next questioner is Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats to Frank and Mike. I wonder just on the discrete, if you could elaborate a little bit on North America and the interplay between some of the structural and it sounds like continued strength that you're seeing in battery electric and semiconductors. But then the flip side of that, anything that you're just seeing from a general industrial cyclical standpoint, whether the macro uncertainty is having any impact or whether it's more just like natural digestion of what's been ordered over the last few years?\n\nRam Krishnan\n\nCOO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, I mean in North America, to be honest, on the discrete side, we haven't seen. I mean we obviously don't play in a big way in semiconductors and batteries yet. We play in a smaller fashion with our DeltaV business, but obviously we'll get a lot more exposure to that dynamic with National Instruments and the core machine automation business that we play in North America. We haven't seen a significant slowdown to date, but it is obviously slower than the momentum we're seeing in the process markets.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. And then also just wanted to ask about NI integration planning and what efforts are currently underway that you're standing up, say over the next six months to ensure a successful launch of the integration process there?\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nYeah, sure. This is Lal. We kicked that off last week in Austin over a day and a half with the management team. We have assembled a team, a steering committee, and then we have functional integration leadership across the eight value drivers or so that have been identified, obviously on a steering committee basis. I participate as does Eric Starkloff. And we have each named a leader on the integration team. In our case, for instance, Cervelo. So that's off and running. Meetings are taking place. We'll have an in-person kickoff with a large group here in St. Louis coming up, and then we'll be off and running on all the full integrations. But really good start. Great organizational discussions already have taken place.\nAnd now we are excited about this work ahead of us as we head to Q4 close.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nLal Karsanbhai\n\nPresident and CEO, Emerson Electric Co\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And this concludes both the question and answer session as well as the event itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to call Colleen Mettler, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of IR, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us for Emerson's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.\nAs always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website.\nPlease join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures.\nI will now pass the call over to Emerson President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for opening remarks.\n\nSurendralal Lanca Karsanbhai\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Colleen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the global Emerson family for delivering yet another strong operational quarter. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to our Board of Directors and the shareholders of Emerson for your continued confidence in this management team.\nWe remain confident about the strength of our markets from both a geographic and an industry perspective. This is exemplified by our project funnel that continues to grow, exceeding $7 billion at the end of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over and discuss the quarter's performance, in review of our strong outlook for the second quarter and the year, I'd like to say a few words about our headquarters announcement this morning. We conducted a comprehensive 3-month review of location options. St. Louis was selected, following this rigorous process, and we look forward now to finding an appropriate location in the region.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. Operationally, the first quarter was very strong for Emerson. End market demand remains strong as first quarter order trajectory played out largely as planned. 5% underlying orders was as expected as broad automation strength was weighed down slightly by a double-digit decline in safety productivity orders against tough comps. Sequential underlying orders were also up 6% versus the September end quarter.\nSales met our expectations at 6% underlying growth, slightly impacted by shutdowns in China. Our business performed very well operationally, displaying the strength of our Emerson management system. Operating leverage, excluding AspenTech, was 40%, ahead of our mid- to high 30s expectation. Adjusted EPS was $0.78 for the quarter and was impacted by two main below-the-line items.\nStock compensation was a $0.09 headwind versus 2022, driven by a 31% stock price increase throughout the quarter and its subsequent impact on the remaining mark-to-market plan. While we expect a slight headwind from the addition of AspenTech's stock comp rolling into our financials, the overall stock compensation headwind was 8% worse than anticipated. Frank will provide more color on this in his section.\nSimilarly, FX was worse than originally expected. However, despite these headwinds, operations performed above guidance as our business continued to execute. Lastly, we completed our committed $2 billion of share repurchase in the first quarter.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'd like to walk through some exciting successes and the strong momentum we see in the value creation priorities we laid out on November 29. First, in late January, we visited the Middle East and had the opportunity to break ground on our new state-of-the-art innovation and manufacturing hub in Saudi Arabia. This investment is designed to not only spur innovation for the region, focusing on the transition to clean energy segments like hydrogen and clean fuels, but also demonstrates our commitment to our regionalization strategy and best cost manufacturing, pillars of our operational excellence.\nAs an example of the projects our investment will supply, Emerson was chosen to provide automation for the world's largest green hydrogen facility by NEOM. The plant will provide 600 tonnes a day of green hydrogen using Emerson Automation technology throughout production processes and renewable power generation. Emerson's local support and installed base in the Middle East were key differentiators.\nSecondly, Emerson and AspenTech continue to succeed with our joint customer solutions. In the first quarter, we were jointly selected to automate the Middle East's largest ethane facility by Qatar Energy and Chevron Phillips, Ras Laffan. Emerson will serve as the main automation contractor for the $6 billion facility, providing our leading DeltaV control system with AspenTech engineering and simulation products. The project is a scale example of our commercial agreement with AspenTech and how it successfully provides an expanded differentiated product offering to customers.\nLastly, Emerson continues to diversify through life sciences and metals and mining markets. In the first quarter, Emerson was awarded the automation contract for Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies in Europe. The expansion project will include multiple bioreactors and processing streams, one of the largest CDMOs in Europe.\nThese three projects are a clear demonstration of Emerson's commitment to the growth platforms we discussed at our investor conference, and our continued success differentiating as an automation leader in these markets.\nBefore I turn the call over to Frank, I wanted to briefly discuss our proposal to acquire National Instruments for $53 per share in cash. As you know, we made our offer public on January 17, and our correspondence with NI since 2022, May is available on maximizing value at ni.com.\nEmerson is committed to an acquisition of NI and is participating in the strategic review process. We believe our premium all-cash proposal with no financing conditions or anticipated regulatory concerns is compelling and in the best interest of Emerson and NI shareholders. We look forward to continued engagement with NI and its advisers and moving swiftly towards an agreed transaction.\nThat said, the focus of this call is our performance for the quarter, and we're not going to be commenting further on our proposal for NI at this time. Be assured that we'll continue to execute financial diligence as we review these opportunities.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Lal mentioned, we had a very strong operational start to 2023. Underlying sales were within our expectations for the quarter at 6%, driven by 10% growth in software and control and 5% in Intelligent Devices.\nNet sales were up 7% with a 4-point drag from currency and a 5-point contribution from AspenTech. World area growth was led by the Americas, which was up 13%, driven by strong process sales, particularly in energy and chemical. The continued energy crisis in Europe affected demand as underlying sales were below prior year by 2%. However, sales were up 7% after adjusting for the impact of Russia.\nSales in Asia, Middle East and Africa were flat versus prior year as strength in the Middle East, driven by chemical and energy investments, was offset by dam sales in China, mainly due to challenging year-on-year comparisons and sporadic COVID-related shutdowns. By industry, we continue to see strength in later cycle markets like energy and chemical.\nChemical investments and plant modernization and sustainability remains steady in North America and Asia, but we are keeping a close eye on this market as we assess our outlook for the balance of 2023.\nOverall, first quarter process industry sales were up high single digits. Similarly, hybrid sales were up high single digits, led by continued investments in life sciences reshoring and metals and mining. Discrete sales were up mid-single digits as this earlier cycle business starts to lap more difficult comps. The growth in discrete was offset by weakness in our commercial business in safety and productivity, which was down 10% for the quarter, but with early signs that we are bottoming out.\nOverall, we feel confident about the health of our end markets and our conversations with customers indicate continued growth in investments during 2023.\nPrice during the quarter contributed 4 points as our pricing actions from 2022 and additional actions taken at the beginning of '23 are driving strong price realization. Backlog grew approximately $700 million during the quarter to $6.6 billion, giving us ample opportunity to execute on the rest of the fiscal year plan.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA margin improved by 130 basis points and leverage was 40%, excluding AspenTech. North America mix contributed to the margin expansion, and price was accretive to margin in the quarter. Software and control margins were up 200 basis points, led by AspenTech. Intelligent Devices performance was strong with 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA expansion.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.78, and I'll discuss the details when we move to the next chart.\nLastly, on this chart, free cash flow of $243 million was down 20% year-over-year, mainly due to trade working capital, including the impact of supply chain performance, which is improving, but is still challenged. We are focused on improving trade working capital as we progress through the year, and we reiterate our expectation of 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 6. This is our adjusted EPS bridge versus the prior year. First, I wanted to say that we had very strong operational results, again, reflecting low 40s leverage on incremental sales, which delivered $0.15 to adjusted EPS in the quarter. There was an unfavorable impact due to stock compensation, as Lal said, of $0.09 and an additional $0.09 due to currency. The stock comp impact was primarily due to our legacy long-term incentive plans, which required mark-to-market treatment on recorded expense of the 31% increase in our stock price during the quarter. The last of these plans will run off in 2023, and the new plans do not require mark-to-market accounting. So going forward, the variability from stock comp will be dramatically reduced in 2024 and beyond from what it has been historically.\nCurrency in the quarter was primarily driven by the accounting treatment of our long-term contracts in addition to customary translation and transaction impacts. Other nonoperating items and share repurchase contributed $0.02 to the quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Turning to our 2023 outlook, we continue to see strength across our end markets. As we communicated in October, process, hybrid and discrete markets are all expected to grow mid- to high single digits in 2023. The long-term secular trends we discussed in November continue to be relevant for our business and are driving growth and successes in 2023.\nEnergy transition spend continues to be strong as evidenced by the successes Lal highlighted a few minutes ago. Energy security investments, including LNG continue to accelerate especially in North America and the Middle East. In hybrid, life sciences investments due to reshoring continue to move forward, and metals and mining spend is centered around electric vehicles and electrification value chains. Those value chains are also benefiting discrete markets, especially in the U.S.\nThe one weakness we see in the business today is our commercial exposure within the safety and productivity segment, which was down 10% in the first quarter. We expect these sales to improve as we move throughout the year as we face easier comparisons and we see early signs of a turn in demand.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. We're maintaining our full year guidance based on the underlying strength in our end markets and robust backlog. The guide for underlying sales growth remains at 6.5% to 8.5%. We now expect currency to be less of a headwind at 2 points, and AspenTech is expected to contribute 3.5 points. Therefore, we are increasing our net sales expectations to 8% to 10% of a point from the previous guide.\nWe are holding operating leverage, adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion for the year at the previous guidance. Within that guide, we intend to cover the unexpected stock comp headwind that we had in the first quarter with excellent operational performance.\nFor the second quarter, we expect underlying sales growth of 8% to 10%. Currency continues to be a headwind, reducing sales growth by approximately 3 points. AspenTech will contribute approximately 5.5 points, and net sales are expected to be 10.5% to 12.5% up. leverage expectations again are in the mid- to high 30s. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.95 and $1, which is a 13% increase at the midpoint of the guide. We've included quarterly data for 2022 on a continuing ops basis in our press release and in the 8-K that was filed this morning.\nThank you for your attention, and we'll now turn it over to the operator for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler. Please, go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of IR, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining Emerson's Third Quarter's Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website.\nPlease join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures.\nI will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for opening remarks. .\n\nSurendralal Lanca Karsanbhai\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Colleen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking the nearly 90,000 Emerson employees around the world for their tremendous effort, passion and commitment to deliver the solid results we will speak about today.\nOver the past 4 months, I've had the opportunity to travel to several U.S. sites, including Houston, Chicago, Louisville, Ohio and Pittsburgh as well as visiting investors, customers and our teams in Germany, Denmark, Brazil and Mexico. I have to be honest, there is no substitute for being with our teams in person. I'm looking forward to this month's trips to India and Singapore. And I'd also like to thank our Board of Directors for their support and our shareholders for your trust in us.\nAs an organization, we continue to make significant progress on all of our strategic imperatives aimed to accelerate value creation, culture, portfolio and execution. Our culture evolution continues in earnest. We are launching our efforts with new listening tools, a modernized employee value proposition and a new reinvigorated talent engine. To this end, on August 1, we hired our first Vice President of Culture, Kelly Clark, who joins our company at a crucial point in time and brings unparalleled experience and cultural transformation.\nTurning to Slide 3. Emerson's portfolio transformation is well underway. And in the quarter, we made significant progress to create a higher growth, more diversified cohesive portfolio. We took 5 important steps: #1, on May 16, we closed the AspenTech transaction. We are very excited about the synergy opportunities, which are sized at $160 million in the funnel and the projects won to date; #2, AspenTech announced an agreement to acquire Micromine, the first transaction under the new structure. Micromine is an Australian-based exploration to optimization, software offering, well positioned to benefit from the minerals required to fuel the renewable revolution.\n#3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Fluxa, a critical life science process knowledge business, highly synergistic with our industry-leading DeltaV system; #4, on May 31, we closed the TOD sale; and last, 5, yesterday, we announced the sale of InSinkErator to Whirlpool Corporation for $3 billion or an 18.1% multiple of adjusted EBITDA. Prior to turning to Slide 4, allow me to say a few words about our execution. This was a solid quarter, and I feel incredibly positive as we go into the fourth and into 2023.\nJune trailing 3-month underlying orders were plus 10%, driven by Automation Solutions at plus 13%. Third quarter underlying sales grew 7%, driven by the Americas, which grew 14%. This performance occurred despite lockdowns in Shanghai, which impacted 6 plants for 2 months and continued challenges with electronics availability.\nTogether, the 2 factors resulted in a $180 million sales impact in the quarter or 5 points to the Automation Solutions segment sales. Adjusted EBITDA improved 20 basis points with improvement in both platforms. Operating leverage in the quarter was 27%, and we are well on track to exceed our 30% target for 2022.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.38, including $0.08 contribution from AspenTech.\nAlthough free cash flow conversion in the quarter was a 100% adjusted for nonoperating and onetime items. Operating cash flow was down, driven by working capital investments in inventory and receivables.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4, please. In addition to the portfolio, Emerson has also made tangible steps in our ESG journey. Recently, we have established a target to reach Net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2045. In the near term, our objective is to reach Net zero in our operations and reduced our Scope 3 emissions 25% by 2030. Our 2021 ESG report, which can be found on emerson.com, includes more detail on our target, which is aligned with the Net zero standards set by the science-based target initiative. Our goals are bold, and we have incredible -- a credible, credible road maps that include many of the solutions, technologies and expertise we offer our customers and the critical industries we serve.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. I am particularly excited about the opportunities in the renewable space. As I said, our portfolio is broadly relevant as an enabling technology across a broad segment of the world's economy. This includes electrification efforts such as heat pumps as well as sustain -- a strong sustainability funnel in automation solutions that has grown to $1.5 billion, inclusive of decarbonization, energy efficiency, emissions management and new energy investments in wind, hydro, solar and hydrogen.\nI'll share a few examples on this slide. First, starting on the left. Emerson was recently selected at Mitsubishi Power to automate the world's largest green hydrogen production and storage facility. The Advanced Clean Energy System hub will convert renewable energy into storable hydrogen, which can subsequently be dispatched and converted to electricity when required. Emerson Automation and software solutions were selected based on industry expertise in our leading digital portfolio. This is a first-in-kind facility, and we'll be capable of producing 100 tons of green hydrogen per day with storage capacity for 300 gigawatt hours of energy. That's equivalent to 150x the current lithium battery storage in the United States.\nNext, in the middle, along with Neste Engineering Solutions, we were chosen to provide automation technologies and software to fintoil for the world's third largest tall oil biorefinery. The advanced biofuel and biochemical facility will refine a byproduct of the wood pulping process to produce sustainable feedstock for biofuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The expected annual capacity of 200,000 tons will create a 400,000 ton reduction in carbon emissions. That represents roughly 1% of Finland's total emissions.\nLastly, Emerson was selected by Albioma, a French energy provider to enable the transition of its flagship coal-fired Bois Rouge plant to 100% renewable energy. Emerson's automation system and software will help convert the existing coal-fired power plant controls to utilize biomass feedstock. In doing so, this project will result in a 640,000 ton reduction in carbon emissions, part of Albioma's plan to reach almost a 100% renewable energy by 2030. These projects and our Net zero targets represent our continued progress in our greening of and greening by framework that Mike Train has introduced.\nAnd lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, on Slide 6, I'd like to highlight a few exciting investments we've made in operations around the world. Our regionalization strategy and operational excellence served us well through the pandemic and in the current challenging supply chain environment. We continue to drive operational excellence with investments like the 3 shown here.\nStarting on the left. Earlier this month, Emerson officially opened our new professional tools facility in Ash Flat, Arkansas. This is a 277,000 square foot facility, which will be used mainly for our Greenlee tools for electrical applications across North America. It currently employs a 150 employees, and will double the employment over the next 4 years. I'm very excited about this investment, and we were honored to have Governor Asa Hutchinson join us for the ribbon cutting.\nNext, in the middle, Emerson recently opened its Mahindra City, Chennai, India facility for Fluid Control pneumatics. This is a 145,000 square foot facility which will help serve cross-sell, hybrid and discrete customers in India and surrounding Asian countries.\nAnd then lastly, we introduced a new Saltillo, Mexico manufacturing facility for our specialty valve technologies, assemblies and actuators using life sciences, metals and mining and other key industries. As with all these facilities, Saltillo will use state-of-the-art factory automation capabilities, environmental designs and include our own Emerson technology.\nAs we close out 2022, I feel extremely positive about where we are as a business and where we are going. Our goal is accelerated value creation and we are executing on all the critical dimensions.\nWith that, I will now pass the call over to Frank Dellaquila, who'll go through our detailed financial results in the third quarter.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 8. Before I comment on the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to ground everyone on 3 significant events that affected the reported results. First, on May 16, Emerson completed its transaction with AspenTech. We contributed our 2 software businesses, OSI and GSS, to AspenTech in addition to $6 billion in cash in exchange for a 55% ownership position in the new AspenTech.\nPlease note that GSS has been renamed to Subsurface Science & Engineering, or SSC for short. OSI and SSC, which were previously reported in our Automation Solutions platform have now been moved to a newly created reporting segment within Emerson called AspenTech. For accounting purposes, our contributed businesses will be acquiring entity. Therefore, our third quarter is the sum of our contributed businesses for the entire quarter and heritage AspenTech results from the May 16 closing date.\nStated simply, our third quarter results include a full quarter of our contributed businesses and approximately 45 days of heritage AspenTech. As a result, year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful as the prior year includes only our contributed businesses. I encourage you to review the slides Colleen and her team have included in the appendix, which show the details of the sales by quarter and map the AspenTech financial results into our financials.\nAs a reminder, AspenTech's results are fully consolidated with Emerson line by line with the 45% noncontrolling interest deducted from earnings used to calculate earnings per share and reflected in a single line in the equity section of the balance sheet. And finally, on that subject, our contributed businesses are no longer included in our usual metrics for Automation Solutions.\nThe second significant item is the Therm-O-Disc divestiture, which was previously reported in Commercial & Residential Solutions. The transaction closed on May 31 and the business is no longer included in underlying orders, underlying sales or backlog calculations. We reported a $428 million after-tax gain equivalent to $0.72.\nAnd finally, we announced on the May call, our decision to exit Russia. At that time, we absorbed several cents operationally within the guidance that we gave. This quarter, we are reporting a $162 million charge which is a $0.29 earnings per share impact, and we are debooking $132 million of orders that will not be converted to sales. The impact of the TOD gain and the Russia related charge will be removed from adjusted earnings.\nSo with that background, if you would please turn to Slide 9, and we'll talk about the quarter. As Lal said, we believe we had a very good quarter. There are operations challenges we could not anticipate or building to the guide, but looking through them, we are very pleased with the underlying operational performance and we believe we can deliver results for 2022 that are in the range of what we told you in May with the exception of cash flow.\nDemand continued to be strong and broad-based and consistent with our previous comments around our key end markets. We missed the underlying sales guidance entirely due to the extended lockdown in Shanghai and some continued challenges around electronic components, neither of which we expected when we guided in May. Together, we estimate these 2 headwinds reduce sales by about $180 million in the quarter, which equates to 4 points of growth for total Emerson, and we estimate that the leverage on those sales was about 40%.\nOur guide for the balance of the year incorporates our expectation at our manufacturing capability in China and our component availability will support our sales plan for the remainder of the year, Ram will talk about both of these subjects in more detail in a few minutes. As a result, underlying sales were 7% falling short of our third quarter guidance by 3 points at the midpoint.\nThere's a lot of good news within these numbers. The business has implemented the planned pricing actions realizing 6 points of price overall and price less net material inflation significantly improved versus our prior quarters according to the plan. Adjusted segment EBITDA improved 170 basis points, driven mainly by the addition of AspenTech, which added 150 basis points.\nOperations improved 20 basis points, as Lal mentioned, despite the $180 million of missed sales and the deleverage on them as price realization and ongoing cost containment measures more than offset elevated inflationary pressures from wages and freight. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.38, up 16% versus prior year, and that includes $0.08 from the AspenTech segment, and I will provide details in a moment.\nFree cash flow was down 36% versus prior year mainly due to higher working capital from increased sales and continued supply chain constraints that cause more investment in inventory than we would have expected.\nIn May, we reduced our cash flow guidance modestly with the expectation that the balance sheet release of working capital would occur during this fiscal year, but the continued operational challenges pushed this release in our estimation into 2023. Nonetheless, free cash flow conversion was 90% in the third quarter, excluding the non-operating items from net income, specifically, the TOD gain and adding back the impact to net earnings of the Russia exit write-offs.\nTurning to the business results. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 4%, and as Lal said, up significantly more, another 5 points of growth if we were to adjust for the loss of the sales in China and due to the supply chain disruptions. Process hybrid and discrete sales were all up, led by energy, chemical and power and renewables segments. Sales in the Americas were up double digits, while Europe mainly due to Russia and Asia, mainly due to the Shanghai lockdowns were down year-over-year.\nPrice realized in the third quarter was 3%, driven by programs instituted earlier in the year and accelerated last quarter to address sustained electronics inflation and continued wage and freight increases. Backlog increased by a $100 million in the quarter to $6.2 billion. This elevated level of backlog will support our sales plan for the fourth quarter and into 2023.\nAs I said at the beginning, backlog has been revised to reflect $132 million e-booking in Russia and removal of the businesses contributed to AspenTech. Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA improved 70 basis points versus the prior year due to price, leverage, favorable mix and cost controls despite the lower-than-anticipated sales volume.\nTurning to Commercial & Residential Solutions. The business continues to grow strongly, up double digits. Underlying sales increased 13%, including 12 points of price realization. Sales were up in all world areas, except China due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and softening demand. As we expected, Climate Technologies aftermarket and commercial strength offset moderating demand in the residential portion of the business.\nIn Tools & Home Products, nonresidential project activity remains strong. However, weakness in the retail segments continues. Backlog was flat in the quarter at $1.3 billion, after removing the impact of the divested Therm-O-Disc business.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the platform was down 50 basis points, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Within that, Climate Tech was approximately flat as 9 points of price realization and ongoing cost reductions drove a significant improvement in sequential leverage and profit margin for that segment. The AspenTech segment contributed $239 million of sales at nearly 54% adjusted EBITDA. Once again, these sales represent a full quarter of results from Emerson's contributed businesses in addition to Heritage AspenTech from the May 16 closing date through the end of the quarter.\nThe heritage AspenTech sales for the period covered the second half of AspenTech's fourth fiscal quarter. and reflect strong revenue growth based on normal seasonality in the business and the applicable revenue recognition rules for software sales. Together, we're off to a great start and we look forward to driving the synergies we identified and the diversification that we envisioned for our combined businesses.\nIf you would, please turn to Page 10 for the EPS walk. As I said, adjusted EPS was $1.38, up 16%. There are several non-operating balance sheet items that net out to $0.02, notably stock compensation -- we still have 2 plans that are on a mark-to-market and they were a significant favorable item in the quarter.\nAutomation Solutions and Commercial residential operations leveraged at nearly 30% and contributed $0.09 to adjusted earnings per share versus prior year. AspenTech contributed $0.08 driven by the strong fourth quarter in the heritage business, net of $0.01 of interest expense attributable to the transaction. We continue to deal with various operational challenges, returning to supply chain, logistics and labor.\nI'm going to hand off to Ram to comment on these issues as they affected the quarter and how we think we can navigate them for the balance of the year.\n\nRam R. Krishnan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 11. Consistent with previous quarters, the operating environment remained challenging in the third quarter, especially in terms of electronic component availability and the impact of the China COVID-19 lockdowns, which lasted much longer than we anticipated going into the quarter.\nStarting with the positives. Freight and labor costs and commodity prices are all trending in the right direction and provided some relief to the overall environment. Labor, which is primarily an issue for us in our Midwestern U.S. plants has improved from the winter months and the COVID-related challenges we have experienced. And commodity prices, mainly steel, copper and plastic resins have all continued to decline as we had anticipated.\nHowever, the 2 most impactful items in the quarter were the extended China lockdowns and the electronic component shortages. As we discussed in May, our expectation was China would begin reopening in the middle of May with full operation near the end of the month. As it played out, reopening was delayed until the end of May with full operation not until early June.\nDuring this time, we did not expect our employees to work in closed loop operations, which would have required extended overnight stays in our factories. Therefore, we had little to no operation during the lockdowns. This delay in reopening represented roughly a $100 million in lost sales in the quarter, primarily from our 6 manufacturing plants in the Shanghai area.\nWe expect most of these sales to be made up in the fourth quarter. The China lockdowns and other supply constraints contributed to further electronic component availability issues. While lead times remain stable at elevated levels, capacity challenges at our critical suppliers led to more de-commits in the quarter, and we were forced to go to the open market to procure components more than we had anticipated. This drove elevated purchase price variances and challenges in converting our backlog to sales, leading to an $80 million sales miss in the quarter, primarily in Automation Solutions.\nSix critical suppliers for us account for about 90% of the component shortages we experienced in the quarter. Our supply chain teams have stabilized the situation going into the fourth quarter using a structured approach to expedite, participating in supply assurance programs and driving purposeful executive engagement with these critical supply assuring up what is necessary for the end of the year.\nFinally, our global operations and supply chain teams continue to do an outstanding job, effectively managing the ever-changing landscape, allowing us to execute successfully for our customers.\nI will now turn the call back over to Frank to take us through the '22 outlook.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Ram. If you would, please turn to Slide 13. As we look towards the rest of the year and into 2023, demand continues to be strong with Emerson trailing 3-month underlying orders, up double digits versus prior year. June trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 13% versus prior year, indicative of broad continued strength across the business.\nSustainability, decarbonization factory automation, modernizations and reassuring secular trends continue to drive investment decisions in key industries. We expect growth to continue in key process end markets like energy, chemicals and power and renewables and also expect favorable conditions in the life sciences and metals and mining markets, all of which will support growth into 2023.\nIn Commercial & Residential Solutions, June trailing 3-month orders were up 5%, led by Climate Technologies, which was up 9%. Commercial, industrial, food, retail and other nonresidential end markets remain strong as project activity continues. Residential Climate business is showing some signs of moderation as we've expected and communicated, while our residential tools and home products business continues to soften as we first mentioned during the May call. This can be seen in the retail data, as inflation weakens demand in the housing-related and home improvement markets.\nAftermarket sales remained strong due to record high temperatures globally and the European heat pump market is propelled by energy efficiency imperatives as well as the unusually warm weather as well in Europe.\nYou would please turn to Slide 14. We'll talk about the guidance update. So the revised guidance considers the continued robust underlying demand and balances it with the impact of the third quarter headwinds that we experienced. Emerson's underlying sales guidance has been moved to the low end of the range, updated to remove Therm-O-Disc and to remove the businesses that we contributed to AspenTech as part of the transaction as well as the continued supply chain constraints that Ram mentioned.\nAutomation Solutions 2022 underlying sales growth is now expected to be between 6% and 7%. We reduced the range modestly again to remove the businesses contributing to AspenTech and to recognize the third quarter impact of the ongoing challenges of supply chain constraints, principally in electronics. As Ram said, the China sales miss is expected to be recovered, but the challenges with electronics will extend beyond the end of the fiscal year.\nRecalibration of the sales outlook is based on our projected ability to convert orders along with the strong underlying demand backdrop, both of which should be supportive going into 2023.\nIn Commercial & Residential Solutions, we have raised the bottom end of the guide to reflect our confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year. The guide reflects continued strong price realization across the platform. The fourth quarter is expected to be strong for both platforms, Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions supported by the solid demand and the record backlog.\nInflationary pressures remain, but our pricing actions are expected to more than offset net material and other inflation. The guidance assumes no further impact on production of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China. And as Ram described, we believe we have secured adequate electronics supply to deliver the sales guide for the year.\nRegarding the AspenTech impact on the guide, Heritage AspenTech's fiscal fourth quarter, which was included in our fiscal third quarter is its seasonally strongest quarter due to the timing of contract renewals and the revenue recognition rules that apply. Therefore, we expect AspenTech's contribution to revenue and earnings to be a bit lower in our Q4. The business continues to drive the synergy plan, and there is active joint project engagement between the 2 companies.\nAspenTech solutions simultaneously help customers meet sustainability and operational excellence targets, which are top investment priorities for both their customers and Emerson's traditional customers. Our combined product portfolio is well positioned to be the digital partner for process and hybrid end users.\nWe've updated the net sales guidance to account for the AspenTech transaction by 1 to 2 points. and the incremental FX impact, which is now a 2- to 3-point headwind as well as the Therm-O-Disc divestiture. The InSinkErator transaction will close after the fiscal year and has no impact on the 2022 guide.\nShare repurchase is expected to be $500 million. There's no change to the tax rate and dividend assumptions that we gave in the May guide. We have reduced the operating cash flow guide to $3 billion reflecting the balance sheet impact of the operational issues that we're seeing, CapEx has reduced to approximately $525 million. Free cash flow has been updated to $2.5 billion accordingly.\nAfter removing the impact of the 3 significant non-operating items, the former is divestiture gain with Russia exiting in the third quarter and the significant Vertiv gain that we had in the first quarter, our free cash flow conversion for the year will be nearly 100%. We still expect total segment operating leverage to be in the 30% range, as we have said all year, and as we have said in previous calls. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $5.25 and $5.35 and adjusted EPS is now expected to be $5.05 to $5.15.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 for the EPS walk. Starting on the upper left, the May guide for GAAP EPS was $4.77 to $4.92, due to the revised sales look for Automation Solutions and the TOD divestiture were lowering the top end of the guide by $0.05. The $428 million after-tax gain on the TOD divestiture and the Russia charge are now incorporated into the guide.\nThe revised EPS guide on a comparable basis to May is $5.20 to $5.30. AspenTech adds $0.13 operationally, partially offset by $0.08 of net intangibles amortization that results from the purchase accounting on the transaction. So the resulting revised GAAP guide for EPS is $5.25 to $5.35. The right side of the chart walks the May adjusted EPS guide to the current guide. The guide was $4.95 to $5.10. We have the same $0.05 operational-related reduction AspenTech operations at $0.13, in this case, offset by $0.03 of interest expense on debt that is attributable to the transaction. So the new guide is $5.05 to $5.15.\nFor your reference, I won't go through it, but on the next slide, there is a bridge from GAAP to adjusted EPS for the fiscal year. The customary adjustment items are there along with the 3 unique items that I've discussed. So before turning to the Q&A, again, I would encourage you to review the slides in the appendix that we've included that explain some of the accounting details of the AspenTech transaction.\nWith that, thank you for your attention, and we will open it up for Q&A.",

Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2.\nThis presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures.\nTurning to Slide 3. As noted in our press release, Emerson officially announced the date and location of our 2022 investor conference. The conference will be held in person November 29 in New York City. More details will be distributed as we approach the conference later this year.\nI'll now turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nSurendralal Lanca Karsanbhai\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking the global Emerson team, who again delivered very strong results amid challenging operating conditions. I'd also like to thank and extend my appreciation to Emerson's Board of Directors for their energy and support of management. And lastly, to all our shareholders who believe in our value creation proposition. Thank you.\nA lot has changed since our call 3 months ago. Operating conditions clearly worsened. The war in Ukraine, COVID lockdowns in China resulted in a return to inflationary commodity environment, lead time extensions and shortages in electronics and logistics challenges. All this resulted in challenging variances across our businesses. But in spite of this, our business performance was strong, and we delivered differentiated results in our ability to execute.\nOrders grew 13% on a March-ending 3-month underlying basis, led by 17% growth in Automation Solutions and 7% growth in commercial/residential. Our underlying sales accelerated to 10% growth with conversion in Automation Solutions improving sequentially to 7% and commercial/residential very strong at 14% growth. We have broad world area strength across our business.\nPrice activity was very robust in the quarter, and it is sticking. But it is largely offsetting inflationary impact of materials, labor and freight costs.\nWe delivered incremental profitability of 24% in the quarter and remain committed to our guideline of 30% for the year.\nEarnings per share on an adjusted basis grew 21% to $1.29, $1.21 excluding an $0.08 impact that came in the quarter.\nBottom line, yes, it is challenging, but our operating diligence, our management process enabled this performance. I'm very proud of the team.\nGoing forward, we see a robust industrial environment led by energy investments in North America and the Middle East. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia has brought North America gas back to life. Reshoring, which many of us have talked about, which at this point has been largely discussed in relation to discrete manufacturing, can and should be now fully valued as it relates to energy, specifically LNG. And Emerson is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. However, I should state that our perspective on energy remains unchanged. We will continue to divest commoditized upstream oil and gas businesses. We have two processes currently in the market. Sustainability investments are core to our customer success, and the unprecedented gas wave will serve both to shore up gas as a transitionary energy source and eliminate European dependence on Russian gas.\nLastly, the technology stack that we can now bring to market, the best-in-class intelligent devices, a highly differentiated control system topology and the industry's leading software offering with AspenTech place Emerson in a unique position to succeed. Our KOB1 funnel grew to nearly $7 billion in the quarter, up almost $0.5 billion, with sustainability projects reaching $1 billion in value within that funnel.\nDemand in our climate business remained strong across most segments, in the mid-single-digit range. We continue to work closely with our HVAC OEM customers as we navigate through challenging inflationary environments. And I appreciate the efforts that Carrier and Train in particular have made to enable us to pass along price actions.\nThe future of this business is bright. We will watch the current residential cycle carefully. But over the medium term, we're well positioned to capitalize on our ESG trends through more efficient systems, new refrigerant standards and the acceleration of heat pump adoption in Europe.\nOur Professional Tools and home products business continued to benefit from strong commercial demand, although residential demand has weakened in the quarter. And we attribute much of that to the fact that household disposable income cannot readily be applied to other activities in lieu of home improvements, and we're watching that carefully. Nevertheless, we have strong backlog positions in that business, which will enable us to deliver strong results for the year.\nOur confidence enables the raise in guide we gave today of $0.05 on the bottom, which is at $4.95 or 10% growth, and the top to $5.10 or 13% growth over 2021.\nRegarding cash flow, we remain committed to a 100% conversion in 2022. Within this guide is the operational impact from our decision to exit our Russia business which we announced today. This includes the sale of our Metran subsidiary.\nWe will also continue to make progress on our portfolio journey with the TOD divestiture expected to close in this current quarter and Aspen shareholder meeting scheduled for May 16 with close expected the same day. We're very excited and I -- and remain excited about working with Antonio to build a unique, highly differentiated industrial software company.\nLastly, I would like to say a few words about our people. Our culture work is underway and we are developing a talent philosophy which will be highly differentiated and enable Emerson to attract and retain the best. A lot of great work on the way by the team on this front as well.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 5.\nWe continue to see strong levels of demand across both platforms, as I indicated. I'll start with a few comments on Commercial & Residential Solutions, whose trailing 3-month orders were up 7%.\nWe are still seeing broad strength across both climate and tools and home products as we hit both comparable results versus -- hit strong comparable results versus a year ago. Within Climate Tech, European resi and commercial heating markets continue to be strong, and Asian decarbonization trends are gaining momentum from government support. As expected, U.S. resi demand began to moderate and -- as we went through the quarter, but remains positive in the Americas as we entered the peak cooling season. For the tools business, as I mentioned, commercial/industrial momentum continues, while residential began to slow. And we'll watch that very, very carefully, particularly the DIY rates, as we go through this quarter.\nThe trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 17% from the prior year, and that's indicative of the continued strength across process, hybrid and discrete. Within hybrid, life science investments remained strong globally, while metals and mining investments and resurgent -- are resurging, particularly in the Southern Cone of America -- of Latin America and in Africa.\nIn the discrete space, supply chain-driven segments like semiconductor and electronics are on track for 20-plus percent year-over-year growth, while factory and machine automation maintained strong momentum. Process markets continued to gain momentum with chemical utilization improving and power market strength through renewables and grid modernization. We also see continued oil and gas spend, as I mentioned, led by U.S. shale investments. Upstream CapEx is up double digit year-over-year despite reinvestment rates near record lows at 40%.\nWe're in the beginning of a strong growth cycle. And I expect to see continued investments in key regions and in decarbonization initiatives. As oil prices rose, we saw more activity around key energy segments such as LNG, clean fuels and renewables. And let me share a little more color with you on these markets on the next slide, Page 6.\nJust to give a perspective on what we're seeing in terms of LNG, which we highlight here, the U.S. opportunity on the left side of the chart, if you think about the LNG wave from 2000 to 2010, which was predominantly driven by the Middle East, we saw 125 MTPAs of invest -- 1 million tons per annum capacity come online during that wave. In the 2011 to 2021 wave, which had a U.S. component, a Russia component and an Australia component predominantly, another 125 MTPAs came online. We currently expect a 2022-plus forward wave that we're now entering and is being funded to result in 250 MTPAs of investment, of which 150 are already underway with an incremental 100 coming online over the next few years. So a very exciting period of time here as we think about gas, not just liquefaction, which will impact Middle East and U.S. predominantly, but then the regasification and tanker investments that are required to get the gas into Europe through this segment.\nOn the right-hand side of this chart, Emerson continues to play a pivotal role as traditional energy players and new entrants begin to focus on new energy segments such as clean fuels and renewables. Our decarbonization and sustainability funnel grew to $1 billion in the quarter as energy companies are dedicating roughly 15% of their CapEx budgets to these projects.\nIn clean fuels, Emerson was recently chosen as the main automation partner for the world's largest renewable diesel facility and will supply key digital offerings as part of this project. Emerson also expanded its role in renewable energy through its acquisition of Mita-Teknik and American Governor acquisitions, which also have -- and also through some technology investments in the core portfolio.\nIn the second quarter, Emerson Geological Simulation Software was selected to provide its geological and reservoir modeling software to HITA, a geothermal energy company in Belgium, to increase the safety and reliability of geothermal energy sources. This is an exciting example of a traditional Emerson application designed for the oil and gas field now expanding to a diversified sustainability application. And then lastly, Emerson was selected as a software and controls provider for the world's largest battery storage facility, another high-growth area where Emerson brings immediate relevance.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Frank to go through the second quarter results.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. If you would, please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review the quarter.\nAs Lal said, we had a very strong quarter. I want to also extend my thanks to everyone in operations for the execution that they turned in and have faced some very real operational challenges.\nDemand continues to be robust across most key end markets, driving second quarter underlying growth of 10%, ahead of the guidance that we provided in February. The higher sales were partially driven by price actions and realizations that were implemented to offset continued inflation. I will talk a little bit more about the price inflation dynamic when we address the guidance.\nFor the quarter, we realized 4 points of price overall, and we did turn positive with respect to net material inflation, as we said we would. Adjusted segment EBITA increased 20 basis points as we more than offset additional material costs and other inflation, which was significant, with increased price and effective cost management. SG&A performance was excellent. We leveraged it. It was essentially flat in dollars in Q2 versus last year and was leveraged 2 points across the enterprise, reflecting previous restructuring actions and spending restraint in the businesses.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $1.29, up 21% versus prior year, exceeding the February guide of $1.15 to $1.20. As Lal mentioned, it includes an $0.08 tax benefit in the quarter. That benefit was included in the 22% tax rate guide for the year, but the timing of when we would see it in the year was uncertain. We had it -- we actually realized it in the second quarter.\nFree cash flow was down 50% versus prior year. This was mainly due to higher inventory as a result of defensive stocking due to supply chain constraints, finished goods awaiting shipment and, of course, higher expected sales in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, we have a challenge. And while we believe this is timing related and we will get on top of it over the course of the year, we expect conversion to improve significantly in the second half.\nTurning to the platform results. Both businesses executed extremely well. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 7% led by the Americas and China. Price realized in the quarter was 2%. All key end markets showed strength, and KOB3 activity continues to be strong, remaining at 60% of sales. Backlog increased by $400 million in the quarter to $6.4 billion due to the strong pace of orders, which gives us confidence in the year-end and positions us very well into 2023.\nOperations have adjusted to longer lead times for critical production inputs, and they continue to effectively mitigate logistics constraints and other challenges. We expect our ability to execute orders in backlog to improve throughout the balance of the fiscal year.\nAutomation Solutions adjusted EBITA improved 170 basis points versus prior year on leverage, price realization and cost control despite higher general inflation and significant cost increases for electronic components in the quarter. We experienced a sharp cost increase in the second quarter with respect to electronics. That has been addressed by price actions and that will be recovered over the balance of the year.\nThe strong operational performance in the platform is reflected in 55% leverage for the quarter, another very, very strong operational quarter.\nCommercial & Residential Solutions also performed well operationally under a similar but somewhat different set of challenges. Underlying sales increased 14%, including 9 points of price realization in the quarter. Price less net material inflation did turn slightly positive in the second quarter, as we said it would, and it is on the trajectory that we said we would be on when we described it in the last call. Sales were up double digits in all world areas except China, where they declined slightly in part due to the lockdowns across the country.\nCommercial and industrial markets remained strong. North American resi grew well in the quarter. We are beginning to see some signs of moderation there. In tools and home products, service, industrial and online channel sales remained strong. There are some indications of slowing in the retail channel as do-it-yourself projects begin to be impacted by the inflationary environment and the diversion of people's attentions to other things as the economy opens up.\nBacklog increased $100 million in the quarter mainly in Climate Technologies. Adjusted EBITA was down 230 basis points, consistent with our expectations going into the quarter.\nAs I said, price less net material inflation was slightly positive in the quarter, remained margin dilutive. And additional price was realized but was offset by freight inflation and above-normal wage costs.\nPlease turn to Page 8 for the EPS walk.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.29, up 21% and exceeding the top end of the guidance range by $0.09, including an $0.08 tailwind from a discrete tax item. Adjusted EPS was also negatively impacted by $0.04 due to prior year onetime gains, the delta that is was impacted. Again, as a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes intangibles amortization, restructuring, transaction costs related to the AspenTech transaction and first-year purchase accounting charges. Operations in total leveraged at nearly 25% and contributed $0.11 to adjusted EPS versus the prior year.\nSo before we go to the guidance, I'm going to turn this over to Ram so he can provide an update on the operational and supply chain challenges that the businesses continue to face. Ram?\n\nRam R. Krishnan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 10.\nClearly, the -- like the last few quarters, the operating environment has remained challenging as electronic supply, commodity inflation and logistics constraints continue to impact our operations globally. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty and COVID lockdowns in China introduced new challenges as we exited Q2 and began the third quarter.\nOn the commodities front, the current geopolitical environment has led to rising steel, nonferrous commodities and oil prices, causing incremental inflation on a large portion of our material purchases. This has been a significant reversal in course for some commodities such as steel. Due to the magnitude of the increases, additional material inflation will be incurred as we progress through the second half. Price actions already in place and the additional ones underway will keep our price less material inflation positive for the second half of the fiscal year but will constrain margins in our climate business.\nHigher oil prices have also led to increased logistics costs. This again reiterates the importance of our regionalization strategy, which allows us to leverage our strong regional supply bases and largely avoid expensive intercontinental logistics.\nOn the electronics side, component availability remains a concern, especially within Automation Solutions. While we see stabilization of lead times, the market is expected to remain tight well into 2023 as capacity additions are not able to keep up with demand. Continued purchase price variances are also impacting profitability, although our proactive price increases help ease the impact. Our global teams continue to do outstanding work to qualify additional suppliers and redesign products to utilize available components. And we're clearly seeing the benefit of this effort come through.\nLastly, the China COVID lockdowns continue to be a fluid situation. The impacts to our second quarter were minimal, but these lockdowns are expected to have a bigger impact heading into Q3. The current issues are contained to our plant operations in Shanghai, but we are beginning to see constraints to our plant operations across the country due to supplier shutdowns. We're keeping a close eye on the situation and will adapt as necessary.\nWhile we expect to face headwinds in many of these areas for the rest of the year, we're confident, very confident, that our global teams will deliver differentiated operational execution in a challenging environment, as evidenced by our strong first half performance.\nI will now turn the call back over to Frank.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Ram. If you would, please turn to Slide 11, and we'll go through the outlook through the -- for the year.\nSo as Lal mentioned at the top of the call, we continue to see very strong demand across nearly all businesses and world areas. The challenges are operational challenges. They are not challenges around the basic demand across the enterprise.\nAutomation Solutions is strengthening across process, hybrid and discrete markets. In process markets, recent events will drive incremental investments across the energy value chain. This strengthening demand will spur growth in transition markets like LNG and emerging markets like clean fuels, battery storage and renewables as well as in traditional oil and gas markets, as Lal discussed. Together with continued robust demand in chemicals, power gen and grid modernization, we are increasing our outlook for the process market growth in 2022 to high single digits.\nWe also expect hybrid demand to remain strong at mid to high single digits, including continued life science investments and high commodity prices, boosting metals and mining CapEx.\nDiscrete markets remain strong in the 10% range with semiconductor, electronics and factory automation investments are all strong.\nSo while we're encouraged by the underlying demand situation, there are constraints, as Ram outlined, regarding supply chain, logistics and potentially COVID in China, which is an evolving situation. It's already had somewhat of an impact in the quarter, and there's uncertainty as to how that will unfold. In particular, we expect challenges to continue around electronics availability, and we expect that to continue into 2023. Continued strength in our core markets, our backlog level and orders momentum provide the underpinning for strong second half sales growth, and we will have to deal with those challenges as they evolve.\nOverall, we have confidence in our fiscal year sales guide for Automation Solutions despite these challenges. And we also have included in the guide the reduction in volume related to the exit from our Russian business, as Lal described at the top of the call.\nIn Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect continued double-digit sales growth for the third quarter and full year. Demand continues to be strong against resi and commercial businesses. In Climate Tech, residential growth is supported by European heating markets and by new product launches currently underway for the 2023 U.S. regulation changes. Climate commercial and industrial growth is also supported by European and Asian heating markets.\nTools and home products retail sales are expected to moderate due to the effect of consumer inflation, as I said earlier. However, continued industrial momentum will benefit the Professional Tools business.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 for the outlook.\nWe are increasing our underlying sales range by 2 points to 9% to 11% driven by the demand outlook and by incremental price versus the prior guide. Automation Solutions guide will remain at 7% to 9%. As discussed on the previous slide, we're increasing our underlying sales expectation for commercial and residential to 12% to 14%, and this is substantially attributable to incremental price being realized in the business.\nWe continue to expect to see tailwinds for price less net material inflation in the second half, as we previously communicated. This is the traditional price/cost relationship that we have always discussed in the context of this business. This year is different. We are seeing significant inflation in other cost areas, and we are implementing significant additional mitigating price actions to protect profits. These actions, however, constrain or dilute margins. For this reason, we're going to talk about price less net material generally as price/cost, as we have described in the past, doesn't really capture the breadth of the inflation challenge.\nI want to point out that we are realizing more than 100% of the material-driven price that was in our previous guide, and we are implementing actions to offset resurgent material costs as well as the other elements of inflation. We're achieving substantial price realization for 2022, but that overall inflation dynamic pressures incremental margins in commercial and residential. We will continue to drive for 30% incrementals for the year for total operations, but we'll probably get there differently than we thought we would even 3 months ago with stronger leverage in Automation Solutions and pressure on the leverage in commercial/residential due to the price inflation equation.\nThe other elements of the guide, tax, dividend and share repurchase, remain the same as they were in February.\nOperating cash flow is now expected to be $3.6 billion due mainly to the increased inventory resulting from supply chain constraints as well as some other balance sheet timing issues.\nWe are absorbing within this guide as well $100 million of tax payments associated with the Vertiv gain that we booked in the first quarter under GAAP fees run through operating cash flow, although they really are related to the financing cash flow that we realized when we booked the gain in the first quarter.\nFree cash flow is now $3 billion and represents approximately 100% conversion for 2022 after converting at 130% last year.\nThe GAAP EPS guide is updated for our improved sales outlook and, as a reminder, includes 2 items related to the AspenTech transaction, both estimated transaction fees and interest expense on the $3 billion of term debt we issued in December in anticipation of the closing.\nThe adjusted EPS guide moves up $0.05 at the bottom and the top to $4.95 to $5.10.\nInside this guide, we're absorbing the estimated impact to operating profits related to the reduction of our Russia business. But we have not included any other potential cost or charging result -- or charges, pardon me, resulting from the exit which are not yet known with any precision. Also, to be clear, no estimate of the operational impact of AspenTech is included in these guidance numbers nor is the future gain or tax impact of the TOD divestiture, which is expected to close this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'll cover the third quarter.\nQ3 2022 net sales growth is expected to be 7% to 9%, underlying sales growth between 9% and 11%. We expect Automation Solutions underlying sales in the range of 7% to 9%, commercial and residential between 13% to 15%.\nGAAP EPS is expected to be between $1 and $1.05 and adjusted EPS between $1.25 and $1.30 on the same basis I described for the year.\nI want to point out that this guide considers the current environment and challenges that the businesses are navigating, including the COVID shutdown, the continued electronic shortages. We're 1 month into the quarter, and these are very real impacts on the quarter. We intend to work through them, and assuming that the critical, uncontrollable variables likely stabilize or improve, we would be well positioned to deliver a very good third quarter and then a very strong fourth quarter to close out the year.\nAnd with that, we will open it up for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler. Please go ahead.\n\nColleen Mettler\n\nVP of IR, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining Emerson's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website.\nPlease join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures.\nTurning to Slide 3. I would like to highlight a few exciting accomplishments for Emerson this quarter. First, in December, Emerson announced the acquisition of Mita-Teknik, a leader in wind power control automation. Mita-Teknik brings specific control design, expertise, complementing our existing Emersonovation and Power portfolio. We are very excited to welcome the Mita-Teknik team to Emerson and its ability to expand our renewable power generation capability.\nSecondly, Emerson was recently named the 2022 Industrial IoT Company of the Year award by IoT Breakthrough. Emerson was acknowledged for advanced digital technologies, software and analytics that help customers across a range of critical industries, optimize their operations and deliver on environmental sustainability goals.\nFinally, last week, Emerson was recognized as a 2022 Best Place to Work for the LGBTQ+ equality, and earned a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index.\nBefore I turn it over to Lal, I wanted to provide a brief update regarding one of our previously communicated investor events. We are now planning to host a half-day in-person investor conference in the second half of this calendar year where we will provide an overview of our business strategy, portfolio direction and long-term financial outlook. We look forward to sharing additional information as we finalize details for this event.\nI'll turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks.\n\nSurendralal Lanca Karsanbhai\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Colleen. I'd like to begin by recognizing the exceptional work that nearly 90,000 Emerson employees did to deliver our first quarter results. I'd also like to express my gratitude to the OCE and the Board of Directors for their continued support. And last, but certainly not least, to our shareholders for your trust and investment in our company.\nSaturday, February 5, marks my first year anniversary as CEO of Emerson. And although I do not intend this to be a holistic reflection of my first year, I would like to share 5 important learnings. One, build good teams and empower them to lead. We have a very strong new OCE. We hired our first Chief People Officer, our first Chief Sustainability Officer, named a new Chief Operating Officer and named our Chief Compliance Officer, to the OCE. And we have an independent chair of the Board and Jim Turley, a great partner for the shareholders and the management of this company.\n#2, diversity makes us better. It is my goal to continue to create a workplace where people feel like they belong have a place and can be themselves. I'm very proud of the diversity targets we established to double representation of women and U.S. minorities in leadership by 2030.\n#3, strengthening any business starts with strengthening its culture. Culture transformation is well underway at Emerson, and it includes the redesign of the Emerson management process into a new modern cohesive system.\n#4, think boldly. Emerson is a historic company going back to 1890. But we cannot be afraid of change and must always be keenly aware of the value creation levers at our disposal.\n#5, tomorrow starts with us. We will live our purpose. We will drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. We will create accelerated value through culture, portfolio and execution.\nAllow me now to turn to the quarter. It was a very positive quarter, significant from a number of dimensions as we delivered $1.05 of adjusted EPS, an increase of 13% over 2021 Q1. Demand is accelerating in Automation Solutions and continues to be very strong in Commercial & Residential Solutions. The trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 17%, for the enterprise as a whole.\nOur relevance with our customers continues to be a differentiator across all of our businesses, whether it is the energy customer undergoing a critical transformation to a carbon-free or lower carbon future or new energy economy start-up customer in hydrogen of biogas. Our KOB funnel continues to be very robust, valued at approximately $6.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and KOB 3 hit 60% of total automation revenues in the quarter.\nInterestingly as well, the sustainability and decarbonization element of the funnel is now valued at over $800 million, up over $100 million over this time last quarter, very positive.\nOur HVAC OEM customers who rely on our compression and electronics know-how to make their systems more efficient to meet new regulatory standards. And also, the tradesman, the utility workers, the plumbers, many of whom, as I continue to learn, have rich tattoos who trust our gear to get the job done. Over the past 100 days or so, I had the opportunity along with many members of management to meet these customers, representing a broad cross-section of our markets and feel great about the role that we continue to play in making them successful.\nOur execution in the quarter was excellent. We improved adjusted EBIT margin to 140 EBITDA margins -- 140 basis points to 19.6%, delivering incrementals of 32% across the enterprise. The automation business is operating at historical levels of profitability with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 320 basis points to 21.5%. Our commercial and residential business was faced with planned but unprecedented price cost challenges, and the team performed exceptionally well. We have confidence in the price and cost management actions that are in place as we go through 2022.\nWe will speak about the operating challenges that continue to be prevalent and most importantly, what we are doing to address them. These include electronics, both lead time extensions and purchase price variances and shortages, particularly that impacted Automation Solutions sales in the quarter, logistics and freight cost escalations and labor wage inflation and availability that our concerns, particularly in North America.\nIn most of these cases, we feel better today than we did 3 months ago, but they do remain challenging. And we have been aggressive and implemented further price plans to offset these additional costs.\nLastly, overall, I have and we, as management, have increased confidence in our 2022 financial plan. We have increased our underlying sales growth estimates for the year to 7% to 9%, up by 1 point and the adjusted EPS target to $4.90 to $5.05, about 10% increase over last year at the midpoint. I've often said to the management team that sometimes growth isn't a lot of fun because we are working so hard. But I'll tell you that there is no other team I'd rather do it with and this thing here at Emerson.\nLet's now turn to Chart 5, please. We continue to see increasingly strong levels of demand across both platforms and all world areas. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, trailing 3-month orders were up 13%, continue an extraordinary level of demand. The European heat pump market continues to benefit from ongoing electrification trends in Europe. For our Tools business, we see long-term cycle demand related to the housing market to remain strong with favorable macro trends and fundamentals, including DIY trends. At the same time, I believe commercial and industrial segments are seeing considerable strength with project starts in the U.S. and Europe.\nThe trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 19% versus prior year, and there is broad strength across discrete, hybrid and process markets across all world areas. China orders were up 34% on a destination basis and continues to be an important growth region. Sustainability-related investments, as I referenced earlier, continue to be a key driver for our business, including renewable and great investments, which benefit our power and OSI businesses.\nWe are also seeing continued recovery in our energy markets with capital spending budgets up significantly year-over-year, in part due to LNG and Middle East investments. Portions of these budgets are being dedicated to decarbonization, emissions and energy efficiency projects, which are accelerating as our customers take tangible steps in pursuit of their ESG targets.\nTo provide a little color on this, I'll highlight a few of our recent project wins related to this growth sector on Slide 6. First, let's start on the left of the chart. Emerson was recently awarded 2 sizable projects in the Middle East with our Measurement Solutions business to help customers reduce emissions. These solutions provide continuous monitoring systems, allowing customers to take preventive actions against emissions and releases. The main driver behind these projects was the customer's commitment to emissions reductions as part of net 0 targets. Both projects were supported by environmental regulations in the Middle East to minimize emissions, protecting the environment and community.\nNext, in the middle, a refining customer in Europe has chosen Emerson to implement a full-scale automation and control modernization of one of their compressor units. The upgraded system, utilizing DeltaV PK controller and control software solutions will provide greater control and load sharing of their system. This greater degree of automation, control and advanced compressor application is uniquely provided by Emerson and will allow the customer to optimize their operations, thereby increasing their efficiency in reducing energy and load requirements.\nSolutions like this can help customers use up to 30% less energy in their operations, a critical number. And that's a critical piece of what many customers net 0 -- of the many customers' net journeys.\nAnd then finally, on the right, last month, Emerson announced participation in the Poseidon project in the Netherlands. Poseidon will be the world's first offshore hydrogen generation projects, basing an electrolyzer on an offshore platform, coupled with nearby offshore wind power generation. Offshore wind will power the electrolysis of the mineralized seawater to produce hydrogen, which should then be transported to shore for integration with natural gas in the national gas grid.\nWorking as one of the key consortium partners with Neptune Energy, Emerson will deploy DeltaV software and systems to manage desalination, electrolysis, gas transportation and the associated infrastructure. Learnings from this project should help provide a broader pathway to large-scale offshore green hydrogen production. So we're very excited with this partnership.\nThese are just 3 examples of how Emerson is assisting our current and new customers on the net 0 and sustainability journey.\nAnd with that, I'll pass the call over to Frank Dellaquila, who will go through our financial results for the first quarter.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us. If you would please join me on Slide 7, I'll go through the quarter. As Lal mentioned, the quarter was very strong. Our business has delivered excellent financial results in the face of some significant operational challenges, and we're very grateful to the people who are working very hard to get through this time of unique challenge in operations.\nOur end market demand continues to be robust across most key end markets, and it drove first quarter underlying growth of 8%, which is in line with our November guidance. This growth was achieved despite the significant supply chain issues that affected the availability of certain production inputs from time to time as we went through the quarter.\nIn particular, electronic component availability in certain automation solutions product lines constrained sales in the quarter. Despite these challenges, adjustment segment EBITA increased 80 basis points, driven by volume leverage, price realization and continued effective cost management. Please recall that as we explained in November, adjusted segment margins now additionally exclude intangibles amortization expense.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.05, up 13% versus the prior year and exceeding the November guide of $0.98 to $1.02. Free cash flow was down 41% versus the prior year mainly due to higher inventory as a result of defensive stocking due to supply chain bottlenecks, finished goods awaiting shipment, but most importantly, higher expected sales in the second half of the year. We believe this impact on cash flow is mainly timing related and we maintain our outlook for the year. And I should point out that our first quarter cash flow last year was at a very high level versus history, just given the dynamics and the ramp-up in our commercial and residential business in last year's first quarter.\nTurning to the platform results. Both businesses executed extremely well in the face of the operational challenges. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 5%, continued recovery in the Americas and strong growth in Asia, particularly in China. All key end markets showed strength in particular, life sciences, discrete automation, chemicals and power. KOB 3 activity continues to be strong, rising to 60% of sales in the quarter. Sales were 1 point below our guide mainly because of the availability of electronics components that affected our systems and instrumentation businesses.\nBacklog increased by $500 million to $6 billion due to the strong pace of orders. We expect that our ability to convert orders and backlog to sales will improve throughout the balance of the year.\nAutomation Solutions adjusted EBITA improved 320 basis points versus the prior year on the strength of leverage, price realization and cost control.\nOperational performance in Commercial & Residential Solutions was also very strong. Underlying sales increased 13%, including 5 points of price realization.\nIn Climate Technologies, residential demand continues to be strong in the U.S. as well as commercial and service businesses growing well.\nStrength in residential construction, DIY and retail demand underpinned strong demand in whole tools and home products. Backlog in the platform increased $150 million in the quarter to $1.3 billion, mainly in Climate Technologies.\nAdjusted EBITA was down 320 basis points, consistent with our expectations for the quarter due mainly to unfavorable price/cost, logistics and wage inflation, which we will talk more about. Underlying leverage and operational performance in the business was excellent.\nPrice cost, as we have traditionally defined it, is price less net material inflation, and that was modestly better than expected in the quarter. However, we are seeing increasing acceleration in terms of freight and wage costs due to logistics constraints and the tight labor market conditions. We are taking price actions incrementally to offset these incremental costs. We continue to expect to see tailwinds for price cost, again, as we define it in the second half.\nPlease turn to Page 8, and I'll take you through the EPS bridge. EPS bridge is pretty straightforward. Adjusted EPS was $1.05, up 13%. And as I said, exceeding the guidance midpoint by $0.05 despite a $0.06 headwind from tax attributable to some internal reorganizations. So as you can see, the nonoperating items wash out and the increase in adjusted EPS is on the strength of operating performance.\nAgain, as a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes intangibles amortization, restructuring, AspenTech transaction fees, first year purchase accounting and the gain from our Vertiv subordinated interest that we recorded in the first quarter. Operations leveraged at over 30% and contributed $0.10 to EPS. Share repurchase was about $260 million, and added $0.02. We do continue to deal, as I said, with the various operational challenges and supply chain logistics and labor. Our teams are doing a great job mitigating the impact of these.\nI'm going to hand the call off to Ram to provide more detail on what challenges we're facing and what we're doing about it.\n\nRam R. Krishnan\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 9. In Clearly, the operating environment remained a challenge in the quarter as electronic supply, labor availability and logistics constraints continue to impact our global operations. Electronic component availability drove the miss versus our Automation Solutions sales guide in the quarter and shown on this slide is what we're currently facing. Availability challenges continue to persist, but we are seeing signs of stabilization at longer lead times, which our operations teams have now calibrated to.\nWhile we still see some spot shortages, on certain electronic components, the number of decommits and pushouts from our suppliers is certainly reducing. We expect these challenges to continue into the second quarter and the rest of the year. And hence, we continue to qualify and ramp up secondary supply and proactively redesigning our products to utilize available components. Our global teams have done an outstanding job actively communicating with both suppliers and customers for improved visibility and forecasting.\nOn the labor front, U.S. turnover remains high but has been manageable. We did, however, see absenteeism rise in November and December due to Omicron. We saw numbers as high as 20% absenteeism in some of our plants in the Midwest. Overall, though, our plant operations have improved their ability to manage through the labor dynamics by adjusting hiring practices and entry-level wages to ensure labor availability and are certainly gearing up for a pickup in output levels as we enter the second half of the fiscal year. Finally, as Frank mentioned, we are seeing incremental wage inflation manifest, but these are being offset with our pricing programs.\nLogistics continues to be constrained by the ongoing supply and demand imbalances and rolling COVID unplanned disruptions. Our teams are mitigating the impact by leveraging alternate ports and our regionalization strategy certainly continues to position us well versus our peers. Freight costs have risen to record levels across the businesses in the quarter, we are mitigating these impacts through surcharges.\nFinally, our global operations team continue to work diligently on these challenges, ensuring that our continued operational excellence remains a strong differentiator.\nI will now turn the call back over to Frank.\n\nFrank J. Dellaquila\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nThank you, Ram. If you would please join me on Slide 11, and I'll go through the outlook for the rest of the year. As Lal mentioned at the top of the call, we continue to see strong demand across nearly all businesses in the world areas, and this underpins our improved outlook for the year.\nWithin Automation Solutions, we see relevant CapEx spend rising in 2022, supported by recent LNG projects reaching final investment decision as well as strength in the Middle East. Our MRO and recurring revenue business also will benefit as budgets continue to increase.\nSustainability-related investments like the projects Lal described continue to be a key driver for our business. And although electronic component availability challenges will continue to limit top side growth potential in the near term, we are seeing stabilization of supplier lead times at longer-than-usual levels but our operations are calibrating to maximize output, as Ron described under those circumstances.\nDiscrete investments remain strong, and we expect a supportive automotive demand environment in the second half along with continued factory automation projects. We expect hybrid demand to remain strong at mid- to high single digits, including continued life sciences investments, and we continue to be encouraged by process automation market demand and spend as we've discussed.\nWith this continued strength in our core markets, the wave of sustainability investments and our backlog and continued order momentum provide the underpinning for strong second half sales growth and gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the fiscal year sales guidance.\nIn Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect continued solid growth and expect the impact of moderation in the residential markets throughout the balance of 2022 to be mitigated by continued strength in commercial and industrial markets. Our Pro Tools business is seeing considerable strength with project starts that drive our U.S. and Europe momentum. Overall, Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth in Q2 and for the full year.\nPlease join me on Slide 12. So in view of the strong demand backdrop and the backlog, tempered by uncertainty and limited visibility around some of the operational challenges, we are raising our underlying sales guide expectations to 7% to 9% for the year, with net sales growth of 6% to 8% currency having an impact of 1 point. The Automation Solutions guide increases to 79% and Commercial & Residential Solutions increases to 9% to 11% all on an underlying basis.\nWe did increase our price cost guide to favorable $175 million as our businesses implement incremental discretionary price actions to mitigate modestly higher NNI, but in response also to the higher freight costs and wage inflation. And as a reminder, both of which are not included in our typical price cost calculation. Simply said, the increase in the price cost guidance has a minimal impact to our profitability at the margin.\nRestructuring actions tax, cash flow, the dividend and share repurchase are all consistent with our November guide. The GAAP EPS guide is updated for our improved sales outlook and now includes 2 items related to the AspenTech transaction. Estimated transaction fees and interest expense on $3 billion of term debt that we issued in December in anticipation of the closing. Those items reduce our GAAP EPS guide versus the November guide net of our operations improvement, and the guide is now $471 to $4.86. The adjusted EPS guide, which excludes those items, increases to $4.90 and to $5.50. To be clear, no estimate of the operational impact of AspenTech is included in these guidance numbers. We will address that in May after we close the transaction.\nWith that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I will turn the call back over to Lal for some closing comments.\n\nSurendralal Lanca Karsanbhai\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Emerson Electric Co.\n\nYes. Thank you. And thank you, Frank and Ram. And before opening up to Q&A, I'd like to acknowledge and you referenced it a couple of times, Frank, the AspenTech team for their strong performance in the quarter, they did report last week. The team and the business is benefiting from increased demand for their software solutions in the sustainability and electrification efforts of its traditional customer base. We are on track to close the transaction as previously communicated in the second calendar quarter of 2022.\nAnd with that, I turn to Q&A.",

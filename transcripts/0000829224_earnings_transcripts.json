Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining. A year ago, we launched our Back to Starbucks strategy to get us back to the exceptional craft, connection and welcoming coffee houses that define the Starbucks experience and set us apart. Since then, we've been focused on executing our plan and accelerating it where we've seen opportunity. We took the significant step of scaling several key pieces of work during the quarter, and it's clear from our results that our plan is working, and our turnaround is taking hold. We finished the fiscal year strong with 5% global revenue growth and global comparable store sales growth of 1% in the fourth quarter, making it our first positive quarter in 7 quarters.\nOur North America company-operated comps improved to flat year-over-year, driven by flat U.S. comp and positive comp growth in Canada. And in both markets, transaction comps continued to improve sequentially from the third quarter. Across our U.S. company-operated portfolio, we more than tripled the percentage of coffee houses with positive transaction comps from a year ago, with year-over-year transactions improving across all regions and dayparts. And we're getting back to winning the morning with flat morning daypart transactions that outpaced our overall recovery in Q4. Notably, our U.S. company-operated sales comp turned positive in September, driven by transactions, and it's remained positive through October, reflecting the momentum taking shape in our business.\nOur International segment continued to demonstrate the resilience of our brand, delivering 3% comp sales growth in the fourth quarter, led by strength across our top markets, including Japan, which bounced back into positive comp territory in the quarter as well as China, the U.K. and Mexico. Earnings per share of $0.52 in the fourth quarter continues to reflect the investments we're making in the business to execute our strategy. As I've said before, we expect to grow the top line first and then earnings will follow. These results demonstrate meaningful progress we've made on our Back to Starbucks plan as we bring our work to scale and they show the early impact of investments we've made across 3 key areas in fiscal 2025 to deliver exceptional customer service, improve the look and feel of our community coffee houses and get back into culture with an overhauled approach to marketing and menu innovation.\nFirst, we've continued to invest in and scale Green Apron Service as the new standard for our coffeehouse customer experience. August was a milestone as we went live with the new standard across our full U.S. company-operated portfolio. We made much needed investments in staffing and hours to put more partners on the floor at the right times. We reassessed and extended hours of operations for about half of our U.S. company-operated portfolio. so that nearly all are now open consistently at or before 5:00 a.m. We expanded rosters and maintained healthy hours per partner. And as a result, we had strong partner engagement record low hourly partner turnover and improved customer experience scores in the fourth quarter. Even though we're only 2 months in, we're seeing the results we want from Green Apron Service, and we're encouraged by the future opportunity we expected to create as our partners adopt the standard and our customers experience the difference.\nWe set throughput goals to ensure customers get their order on time, every time, whether it's in cafe, mobile order or in the drive-thru. As part of our Green Apron service rollout, we launched our SmartQ sequencing algorithm. Since implementation, more than 80% of our U.S. company-operated coffee houses had cafe service times averaging 4 minutes or less, even with greater transaction volumes following our fall launch. Average drive-through service times are still below our 4-minute target, and Mobile Order and Pay remains highly accurate and on time. Our delivery business in the U.S. has also continued to expand rapidly, growing nearly 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and surpassing $1 billion in sales for the full fiscal year. And we will be nearly complete with the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer in our U.S. company-operated coffee houses by the end of Q1, making it easier than ever for customers to get a fantastic and freshly brewed cup of coffee of their choice.\nSecond, we're now delivering a great customer experience in coffee houses that are more warm, welcoming and connected to their communities. Earlier this year, we shared that we were reassessing our North American portfolio. The reality, as we came to learn was that we were operating some coffee houses that didn't demonstrate a viable path to profitability or create a warm, welcoming space for our customers and partners. As a result, for the full year in fiscal 2025, our North America company-operated store counts declined by approximately 1% on a net basis. With a healthier base of coffee houses, we see meaningful opportunity for growth. We're taking a disciplined approach to how, where and what we build to improve both the customer experience and unit economics. We are piloting a new coffeehouse prototype with lower build costs and optimize space utilization that still deliver a full coffeehouse experience aligned to our brand. In fact, last month, we converted one of our pickup-only locations in New York into a small format version of this prototype. We're excited to test, learn and iterate. Our teams are also working at pace to ramp up our uplift renovation program. bringing warmth, texture and seating back into our coffee houses. As of the fourth quarter, we completed nearly 70 uplifts primarily across New York and Southern California. It's a small sample size, but we are encouraged by the improvements to sales and transactions we've seen to date. We are working to complete more than 1,000 of these uplifts by the end of fiscal 2026.\nThird, we've overhauled our marketing and our venue innovation, and it's driving stronger customer perception scores and market share growth in the U.S. On the heels of a successful fall launch, we introduced protein cold foam and protein lattes at the end of September. They taste great and they're made from premium ingredients, living up to the Starbucks standards. And they kick off a steady pace of disciplined, stage-gated innovation in our menu pipeline. We're only about a month in, and we're learning a lot. Customer awareness continues to build, and it is bringing less frequent customers into our coffee houses. We're excited about the incremental nature of this platform and its long-term role. Our measure for brand affinity accelerated in the quarter, reaching its highest point since 2023. And Starbucks ranking as customers' first choice was a 5-year record high. We saw the biggest gains in service time, connection and care perceptions, demonstrating the power of Green Apron Service. Non-Starbucks Rewards customer transactions grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter across all day parts validating our approach to marketing. And value perception strengthened across all generations in the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year, driven by our investment in Green Apron Service and our proactive moves to bring back the condiment bar, simplify our pricing architecture and remove the extra charge for nondairy milks. We know our value equation extends beyond pricing. And when we provide great customer service alongside handcrafted personalized beverages made with high-quality ingredients, we provide unmatched value to our customers.\nTurning to international. Our growth agenda in Back to Starbucks principles span well beyond North America. In the fourth quarter, our international business reached record revenues of $2.1 billion and ended the year with an all-time high of $7.8 billion. We continue to extend our global reach, opening 316 net new coffee houses in the fourth quarter for a total of more than 900 in fiscal 2025. We also opened brand-building Starbucks flagship coffee houses, including inside the legendary Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium in Madrid with more flagship coffee houses in store for 2026, will bring one-of-a-kind experiences centered on coffee and craft to even more customers around the world. In China, the team continues to drive demand in a competitive marketplace, delivering 2% comp growth in Q4, its second consecutive quarter of positive comps, and our portfolio crossed 8,000 stores.\nOn the strategic front, we've had very strong interest from multiple high-quality partners, all of whom see significant value in the Starbucks brand and team. We expect to retain a meaningful stake in Starbucks China and remain confident in the long-term growth potential in the region. As I reflect on fiscal 2025, we did important work to rebuild our core and strengthen our foundation, and we're entering fiscal 2026 on stronger footing. Looking to Q1, the holiday season is a cherished moment for our customers. and for our business. It's the first time we're bringing all our work together. Our coffee houses will be more warm and welcoming. They'll be better staffed, orders will be better sequenced will have a relevant menu with holiday classics like the Peppermint Mocha and Snowman Cookie alongside returning favorites like the Eggnog Latte, which customers have been asking us to bring back for years. We'll have engaging new ads and great new merchandise that's worth gifting, like our limited edition Barista glass mugs and -- Hello Kitty collaboration. And we'll have newly designed gift cards, which have become a holiday staple. As we bring it all together, I'm confident the holiday season Starbucks will be iconic, and our customers will see and feel the difference. Building on investments made in fiscal 2025, we're focused on executing with excellence and driving growth through innovation in fiscal 2026. Our intent is to become the world's best customer service company. To do this, we'll double down on Green Apron Service by empowering our leaders in and above the coffeehouse. We'll scale the assistant store manager role across more company-operated coffee houses and will dramatically simplify store-level reporting from nearly 2 dozen metrics down to a scorecard of just 5 KPIs that best correlate to comp growth. These are focused on the customer, the partner, transactions, inventory availability and food safety. We are giving our partners the tools, roster and processes to consistently deliver our standard.\nAnd as we work to deliver a consistent customer experience across every coffeehouse, we're also improving how we work with our licensee partners to provide more tailored support, drive operational excellence and profitably grow together. Just last week, we hosted our North America licensee partners here at our support center, and we're excited for what's ahead. As we work to leading culture, we're driving continued menu innovation that wins the morning and helps us earn the afternoon. In 2026, we'll introduce an up-level base case that features new artisanal bakery products and elevated service wares to mirror our coffeehouse five. And building on our recent Macho formulation, we'll continue to optimize and up-level our Macho menu with more customizable offerings that meet customer needs and stay true to our brand. Work continues on our supply chain to support our pace of innovation and improve inventory availability. And through 2026, you'll see us announcing improvements to our rewards program and mobile app and new brand activations. Our strategy is only as good as the people who are executing. And over the past year, we underwent significant change and fast. We asked a lot of our partners across the company, and they are delivering with excellence to build a stronger Starbucks.\nI would like to take a moment to thank our Green Apron and support partners who are working hard to bring our strategy to life every day. You really can feel the energy and excitement in our coffee houses and the change is real, and our partners are leading it. Whether it's Melissa and her team in Austin, that's built up such a strong community there, Jessica and Mary Beth and Nashville, who are clearly dialed in to what it takes to deliver great customer service or Oscar in New York and his commitment to coffeehouse at-a-glance. Your focus on coffee, craft and connection is truly making a difference. So as I conclude let me put it simply we set a plan, we're working the plan, and the plan is working. We have more work to do, but we're building momentum. Regardless of the headwinds and tailwinds, we may encounter, I'm confident we have the right team and strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth.\nI'll now turn it over to Cathy to share more detail on our financial results.\n\nCatherine R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Target Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian. I'll start where Brian ended by also thanking our partners around the world for their focus and commitment to building back a better Starbucks. Their hard work helped us gain traction in the fourth quarter and deliver on some critical objectives that we believe will bring us back to sustainably growing both the top and bottom line.\nI'll now discuss our Q4 results. Our Q4 consolidated revenue was $9.6 billion, up 5% to the prior year, reflecting 2% net new company-operated store growth and a 1% increase in global comparable store sales driven by international outperformance, positive comps in Canada and continued progress in our U.S. business. In the U.S., our comparable store sales were flat year-over-year, with ticket up [ 1% ], reflecting fewer discount-driven offers in the current year. While U.S. company-operated transaction comps were down 1%, we marked our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. We are rebuilding our transaction base as we focus on improving the overall value proposition for our customers. We were especially pleased to deliver transaction-led comp sales growth approaching 1% in September, as we benefited from the first full month of Green Apron Service across our U.S. company-operated coffee houses as well as the timing shift of our fall launch.\nOur 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base grew 1%, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 34.2 million members. This was led by higher reengagement and fueled by customers returning for their seasonal favorites and new offerings as part of our fall launch. Transactions among this cohort also continued to improve in the fourth quarter. and our intentional shift away from last year's discounting strategies drove a healthier mix of non-discounted transactions. As Brian mentioned, non-Starbucks Rewards customer transactions in the fourth quarter grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Our U.S. licensed store portfolio revenue declined in Q4. We primarily due to trends in the grocery and retail channels. Travel remains a bright spot, however, with airports delivering positive transaction and ticket growth in the quarter. The College and University segment also showcased year-over-year growth, supported by a good start to the fall semester.\nMoving on to international. This segment reported 9% year-over-year net revenue growth in the fourth quarter, delivering another record of over $2 billion. Many of our top international markets contributed to strong comp sales performance in the quarter with China, Japan, the U.K. and Mexico leading the way. China continues to grow and improve profitability. Starbucks, China's comparable store sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by a 9% improvement in comparable transactions. The market's comp growth was driven by continued product innovation particularly in its late lineup and a fast-growing delivery business. The team remains nimble in optimizing its product and pricing architecture in a dynamic marketplace. Moreover, Starbucks China's healthy unit economics is less motivated to capture the abundant white space we continue to see in the region. As Brian mentioned, we remain focused on our search for the right partner to help unlock our future growth potential in China. As a reminder, the value to Starbucks in a potential transaction includes 3 things: the upfront investment by our future partner, Starbucks retaining a meaningful stake in the China business and future royalty payments.\nIn our Channel Development segment, our Q4 net revenues grew 16% year-over-year due to higher revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain market share leaders in the North America at home and ready-to-drink coffee categories, amid a challenging coffee price environment. We continue to work with our partners to adapt and innovate to broaden our reach beyond our cafes. In fact, the 2024 launch of our protein drink in the U.K. has exceeded our expectations, resulting in growth into 8 additional markets in 2025. We have expectations to expand this further next year, including in the U.S. through our North American coffee partnership.\nShifting to margin. Our Q4 consolidated operating margin was 9.4%, contracting 500 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily driven by inflation, led by coffee prices and tariffs as well as investments in support of back to Starbucks, largely in labor hours. Consolidated G&A in the quarter decreased by 2% versus the prior year to reach approximately 6.6% of revenues. And with our interest expense and effective tax rates generally coming in line with our expectations, Q4 EPS was $0.52, down 34% from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we took decisive action on multiple fronts to accelerate getting back to Starbucks. This included the completion of our assessment of our coffeehouse portfolio and identified closures as well as a simplification of our broader support organization to one that is streamlined and more closely aligned to our future growth priorities.\nLet me walk through some of the impacts to our financials. In the fourth quarter, we had 107 net store closures globally as part of the restructuring we announced in September. These coffee houses were deemed unable to meet our standards for customer experience, even through a potential uplift or for profitability. Many fell under both categories. As a result of these closures, we expect a reduction in our baseline North America company-operated revenues partially offset by sales transfer to nearby copy houses that remain open. We also expect the impact to operating margins to be slightly accretive. As we look to the future, we are focused on disciplined capital deployment with work underway to reduce build costs and improve the profitability of new coffee houses while continuing to deliver a warm welcoming coffeehouse environment. Given that our development pipelines naturally carry long lead times, we expect the benefits of these strategic changes to flow through our P&L gradually over a multiyear period. In the near term, however, we expect that the cost reduction related to streamlining our support structure will have more immediate impacts to our P&L. As such, we expect that our consolidated G&A in fiscal 2026 will run lower than fiscal 2023 levels, serving as a partial offset to our back to Starbucks investments.\nWhile we expect to provide our near and longer-term outlook during our Investor Day in late January, the following are some initial considerations for our U.S. company-operated business for fiscal 2026. We're pleased with the progress we've made to date with our positive comps in September continuing through October. Our Green Apron Service standard is ramping, and we're no longer lapping heavy levels of promotion in fiscal 2026. We're excited about a strong holiday lineup, future menu innovation and our coffeehouse uplift. We also recognize that we have more work to do as we continue to rebuild our transaction base. Turnarounds are difficult to forecast. And while we have good reason to believe that our U.S. company-operated comps should build through the year, we also know that recoveries are not always linear.\nMoving to earnings. We remain disciplined on costs as we focus on allocating our resources to our back to Starbucks priorities. Our investments in Green Apron Service will annualize through fiscal 2026. We'll also stay nimble in navigating the current environment where tariffs and company prices remain dynamic. As we continue to grow, our goal is that every transaction is higher quality and more profitable. We're on a multiyear turnaround, Q4 was a turning time, having delivered the first quarter of global comp growth in 7 quarters, and we're encouraged by our trends to date in Q1 were used on driving our top line and managing the costs that are within our control giving us confidence in our path to sustainable, durable long-term growth. As a token of such confidence, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend earlier this month, recognizing our 15th consecutive year of increase. We are clear-eyed about the work ahead of us, and we're excited about our future.\nAnd with that, we are now ready to take your questions. Thank you. Operator?",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining today. It's clear Back-to-Starbucks is the right plan. It is grounded in feedback from our customers and partners, and it's rooted in what has always set us apart: a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. This quarter, we've made meaningful progress, and we are ahead of our expectations. We're moving quickly to transform both the business and our culture. We're testing, learning, and focusing on the work that has the biggest impact. We're fixing the operational foundations of the business and building a platform for innovation in 2026.\nSome of the changes are already visible, while others will be seen in the months ahead. There's still much to do, but I'm excited by what I see. I'm confident that we're not just getting Back-to-Starbucks. We are building a better Starbucks, where everyone can experience the best of Starbucks, one that is stronger, more resilient, and consistently growing. A Starbucks that is once again the gold standard in customer service, partner experience, the coffeehouse experience, and financial performance. Let me start by sharing the results and then talk about the progress we are making.\nFor the quarter, total company net revenue was $9.5 billion, with a global comparable store sales decline of 2%, a global operating margin of 10.1%, global net new store growth of 4%, and earnings per share of $0.50. In North America, Canada led the way with its second consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales, while in the US, comparable sales declined 2%. We are clearly in the early stages of our turnaround in the US, but our work is gaining momentum. In our international business, we achieved record-breaking quarterly revenue. It is worth noting that China delivered 2 points of comparable sales growth and 6 points of transaction growth through Q3.\nOur EPS in the quarter reflects the strategic investments we're making in our Back-to-Starbucks strategy, like Leadership Experience 2025, which we believe will power our future growth. While our financial results for the quarter don't yet reflect all the progress we've made, I see meaningful signs from across our US business that we're on the right path. Here are a few examples. We've energized our partners, and they see and feel the difference. Retail partner engagement scores are up, and coffeehouse leader engagement is nearing historic highs. Hourly partner turnover is 49.1%, and shift completion is at a record 98.2%.\nCustomers are liking our marketing and noticing that our speed, hospitality, and accuracy are improving. Customer connection scores are up, and customer complaints are down, both quarter over quarter and year over year. Customer value perceptions are near two-year highs, driven by gains among Gen Z and Millennials, who make up over half our customer base. We saw the percentage of company-operated coffeehouses with positive full-day transaction comps and positive morning transactions improve for the third straight quarter. Non-Rewards customers delivered transaction growth year over year for the first time since the post-pandemic recovery.\nOur college and university licensed business saw year-over-year comparable sales growth in the low double digits, showing renewed brand love from younger customers. We have huge strengths that differentiate us and form the foundation of our turnaround. We have three strong businesses: in-cafe, drive-thru, and digital, that are each substantial on their own, and we're rapidly growing a fourth with a delivery business that delivered year-over-year transaction growth of more than 25% and looks to be highly incremental. Average peak drive-thru times are under our service time goal at 3 minutes and 20 seconds across our more than 7,600 drive-thru coffeehouses.\nOur mobile app is highly rated, and our reputation as a digital leader is a huge strength. We saw non-discounted transactions grow among our nearly 34 million 90-day active members in our rewards program, and we have one of the largest social communities in the industry with over 65 million followers. These strengths and signs of progress are why I remain confident in our ability to win. We have a lot of work underway, but today I want to focus on three critical areas: operational changes in our coffeehouses, transforming our coffeehouse portfolio, and then how we plan to build on these foundational changes with a wave of innovation in 2026.\nLet me start with the operational changes. We've already taken several steps to improve the customer and partner experience, including bringing back condiment bars, eliminating the upcharge for non-dairy milks, implementing a new coffeehouse code of conduct, and rolling out coffeehouse walk certifications. In June, we brought together 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America for Leadership Experience 2025. We focused on coffee, craft, connection, opportunity, and sharpened our commitment to customer service excellence. The momentum from the event continues to inspire our coffeehouse leaders as they drive our transformation.\nThe most significant change will come as we begin fully scaling Green Apron Service across all US company-operated coffeehouses in mid-August. Green Apron Service is a new foundational operating model that establishes repeatable, consistent, and scalable standards. It is Starbucks' biggest investment ever in operating standards and customer service. Green Apron Service starts with the five key moments, including craft and connection, that define the experience we want every customer to have every time they visit. It is enabled by an evolved staffing model, which includes adjustments to roster size, labor hours, peak coverage, and deployment.\nWe're also rolling out our SmartQ technology, an advanced order sequencing algorithm designed to ensure consistent, timely service across all our access points. We've accelerated the rollout of Green Apron Service well ahead of schedule because of the strong early results from our pilots. Just eight weeks into our 1,500 store tests, partner feedback has been tremendous. Coffeehouses using Green Apron Service have driven improvements in transactions, sales, and customer service times. Peak transaction comps have already started to grow, and all-day transaction comps are outperforming the broader North American portfolio.\nWhere we've deployed SmartQ, we've seen a double-digit improvement in café orders handed off in under four minutes, with 80% of in-café orders now meeting that target. Drive-thru service times are consistently under four minutes, and mobile order and pay is more accurate and on time. SmartQ is bringing order to mobile order. Once all elements of Green Apron Service are fully implemented together and customers come to appreciate the improved experience, we believe these trends will continue to improve. To ensure they do, we're launching a new GROW Report in Q1, FY 2026.\nIt's a simple tool that helps coffeehouse leaders focus on five key drivers of same-store sales growth, and it'll provide sharper insights to improve our outlier performance and incentivize retail leaders. The GROW Report and our coffeehouse walks are emblematic of a fundamental shift in our expectations for retail leaders, who will be spending more time in stores focused on operational excellence and customer service. Lastly, we still have an opportunity to meet the demand we already have by reducing unacceptably high out-of-stocks. The supply chain team is focused on it, and in our pilots, we've been able to improve item availability.\nNow, I want to talk about the changes we're driving to our coffeehouse portfolio. Every coffeehouse we operate should be warm and welcoming and provide a place for customers to connect and gather. They should have a great seat for any occasion, and they should provide customers access to a high-quality mobile order and pay experience and a drive-thru where possible. We slowed new builds and major renovations to prioritize a new coffeehouse uplift program, with a target investment of approximately $150,000 per store and minimal to no downtime. Uplifts are intended to quickly replace thousands of seats we removed and introduce greater texture, warmth, and layered design. Work is accelerating now in New York City.\nWe'll begin in Southern California later in Q4, and by the end of calendar year 2026, we will have completed at least 1,000 uplifts across North America. We've also begun work on the coffeehouse of the future. We have a new standalone prototype that will open in fiscal 2026 that has 32 seats, a drive-thru, and a roughly 30% lower cost to build. A small-format version with approximately 10 seats is under construction in New York City and will open in the next few months. We believe this new prototype will deliver an exceptional customer experience, improve unit economics, and unlock growth opportunities in more markets.\nWe plan to complete an evaluation of our North America portfolio by the end of this fiscal year to ensure we have the right coffeehouses in the right locations to drive profitability and deliver the Starbucks experience. As a part of this work, we plan to sunset our Mobile Order and pickup-only concept in fiscal 2026. We found this format to be overly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand. We have a strong digital offering and believe we can deliver the same level of convenience through our community coffeehouses with a superior Mobile Order and Pay experience.\nTogether, we expect these changes to our operating model and our coffeehouse portfolio strategy will improve and transform the foundations of our North American business so that we are reestablishing that moment of connection between a barista and their customer, bringing back warm and welcoming coffeehouses with great seats, delivering drinks in four minutes or less in the café and drive-thru, while bringing order to mobile order, right-sizing store renovations and new build costs, eliminating unproductive menu items, and reducing our reliance on deep discounts and promotions.\nBecause of this hard work, we are creating an operating platform to build on with a wave of innovation in 2026 across digital, loyalty, and our menu. This quarter, we made the most of legacy plans in place, but we have much higher ambition. Building on our Back-to-Starbucks plan and new foundations, we will bring a consistent drumbeat of innovation to market through fiscal year 2026. We're building a robust menu innovation pipeline, leveraging our Starting Five approach and Stage Gate Process that is centered on premium coffee experiences and exciting beverages beyond coffee, artisanal food that resonates across day parts, and the function-forward, modern offerings that customers want. In late Q4, we'll introduce Protein Cold Foam.\nThis is the first breakthrough innovation built and tested with our Starting Five approach. It taps into what has become one of our most popular modifiers, cold foam, which grew 23% year over year. Protein Cold Foam with no added sugar is an easy way to add 15 grams of protein to virtually any cold beverage, and customers can also add the flavor of their choice. Early in calendar year 2026, we'll launch a reimagined artisanal baked case and a bold new 1971 Dark Roast coffee available on our Clover Vertica brewer in all US company-operated coffeehouses. As we move further into 2026, expect more experiential beverages and nutritious, satisfying bites for the afternoon day part.\nThis month, we'll start testing new coconut water-based tea and coffee beverages in select markets, and we'll lean into customer needs with upcoming tests of gluten-free and high-protein options to create food that's as artisanal as our beverages. In 2026, we'll also introduce new platforms, including global flavors and customizable energy offerings. And of course, we'll continue to own our hit seasons like fall with the Pumpkin Spice Latte and holiday. Our rewards program is a huge asset for us with those nearly 34 million 90-day active members. In early 2026, we'll launch significant innovations in our Starbucks Rewards program, addressing key customer feedback and introducing exciting new features designed to grow loyalty, brand love, and engagement.\nWe have an incredible digital business, and in 2026, we'll lean in further with a new Starbucks App and significant enhancements to Mobile Order and Pay that will further improve our ability to deliver a great customer experience at pickup. As we work to turn around the US business, we believe we have huge opportunities outside the US too. This quarter, our international business posted more than $2 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. Many of the changes we are driving in the US, like lower-cost store builds and renovations, can scale around the world, creating opportunities to grow the business faster. In China, the near-term changes we made are paying off.\nThrough Q3, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of revenue growth, and total comp turned positive. Beverage innovation and new customization options drove customer frequency, and our changes to non-coffee pricing broadened our customer base and bolstered afternoon and evening sales. As you know, we've been working to identify a strategic partner with a like-minded vision and values to help us capture future growth opportunities in China. We've received significant interest from more than 20 interested parties, and we're evaluating options. We remain committed to our China business and want to retain a meaningful stake.\nThe intense interest in partnering with us is a testament to the great team, strong brand, and long-term opportunity for Starbucks in China. It really is a vote of confidence. Finally, we will only enter a transaction if it makes sense for Starbucks. Across other markets, performance continues to improve as well. In the UK, we see continued momentum with improving comparable sales performance in the low single digits, driven by a focus on connection, beverage consistency, food innovation, and labor investments to support peak operating hours. The momentum stretches across EMEA as well, with overall Q3 revenue and comparable sales up year over year.\nOur business in Turkey, for example, is performing strongly despite a challenging economic environment, and we opened our 750th store in the market. In Latin America, we maintained double-digit year-over-year growth in system sales, revenue, and operating income. Mexico is approaching the 1,000-store milestone and provides a roadmap for profitable growth in the region. As we look forward, we see significant opportunity to accelerate growth across our international licensed markets. The team is focused on it and is thinking big. As I look back on the progress we've made this quarter and my 10 months here, I believe more than ever in our Back-to-Starbucks plan.\nWe've had to fix a lot, but we've done the hard work on the hard things. We've moved quickly to build a more consistent operating model, set clear customer service standards, and bring order to mobile orders. We're right-sizing our new store builds and renovations to improve economics, and we're addressing inventory availability. Though these are areas we know we can move even faster, and we're fixing our cost structure and finding offsets across our P&L to support investments at the store level. This transformation lays the operating foundation for our ambitious innovation agenda, and I'm confident by the end of 2026, Starbucks in the US will look and feel very different, delivering the industry's best customer experience. We're not just getting back to Starbucks.\nWe're building a better Starbucks where everyone can experience the best of our brand. As we do, we believe we'll drive a stronger top line, and in time, healthy, sustainable profits will follow. I know there's a lot of interest in our long-term plans, and I'm pleased to confirm that we will hold an investor day in Q2 of fiscal year 2026. I look forward to seeing many of you in person. Before I close, I want to say thank you to our Green Apron partners. The energy and enthusiasm at leadership experience was inspiring, and I continue to see that same momentum every time I visit our coffeehouses.\nBack-to-Starbucks is coming to life through the passion and leadership of our coffeehouse leaders and Green Apron partners. I'm grateful for the way they're embracing change and delivering world-class customer experiences. Thank you. They're truly creating the green wave. I also appreciate how our support center partners are embracing the changes in how we get work done. We're all committed to building a culture centered on performance, accountability, and prioritizing support for our coffeehouse teams. Thank you for the important role you're playing in driving this change. With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy to share more detail on our financial results for the quarter.\n\nCatherine Park\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm now four months into my role at Starbucks, and I am confident we have the right strategy in place. We are moving with pace and urgency and are seeing encouraging results from our pilots. We are testing, learning, and iterating quickly as we work towards rebuilding a better Starbucks known for exceptional customer service and serving the world's finest coffee. I'll now cover our Q3 results. Our Q3 consolidated revenue was $9.5 billion, up 3% to the prior year, reflecting 6% net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales.\nOur global comparable store sales performance was led by a 2% decline in the US, with US transaction comps down less than 4%. While our transactions remain impacted by lapping highly discounted promotions in the prior year, we are seeing continued progress. US company-operated transaction comps improved for the third consecutive quarter. The percentage of US company-operated stores with positive full-day transaction comps and positive morning transactions also improved for the third consecutive quarter. We are seeing improvement across most urbanities, most notably in central business districts, and non-Starbucks Rewards members' transactions grew year over year for the first time since the post-pandemic recovery.\nWe're also making progress with our Starbucks Rewards customers, with quarter-over-quarter improvements in the number of transactions not on promotion. We'll continue to drive growth and loyalty with our Rewards customers through a reimagined loyalty program next year. Our ticket growth in the US for the quarter was 2%, reflecting fewer discount-driven offers in the current year. We have reduced the percentage of discounted transactions by 1/3, putting us back to more normalized levels as we build back a healthier transaction base and focus on improving the overall value proposition for our customers.\nRounding out North America, Canada had another strong quarter with sales comp growth in the low single digits, propelled by product innovation, particularly in food. Our US licensed store portfolio revenue declined in Q3, driven by the grocery and retail channels. However, we saw strength in airports, where sales volumes grew in the quarter despite TSA traffic declines, as well as in the college and university segment, as Brian mentioned. Licensed stores are a critical part of our portfolio, and we have been actively addressing licensee economics and profitability to fulfill our aspiration to be a world-class licensor.\nOutside the US, the international segment again delivered strong performance, with seven out of the top 10 markets comping positively, with particular strength in the UK and Mexico. China continues to grow and improve profitability. Starbucks China's comparable store sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by a 6% improvement in comparable transactions. The market's comp growth was driven by successful product innovation, including the new Zero Sugar Full-Flavor platform, a strong integrated marketing campaign, and outsized delivery growth. Japan had negative comparable sales in the quarter as the market lapped strong LTO performance in the prior year and has been challenged by soft consumer sentiment.\nHowever, our brand continues to be strong, and our core coffee and tea products are performing well. In our channel development segment, our Q3 revenues grew 10% year over year due to higher revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain market share leaders in the North America at home and ready-to-drink coffee categories and continue to work with our partners to innovate and broaden our reach beyond our cafes. Turning to store growth, we opened 308 net new stores globally in Q3, primarily consisting of company-operated growth in the US and China, and international licensed growth.\nAs Brian mentioned, we are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of our portfolio to ensure our coffeehouses can represent our brand and customer promise, which we expect to complete by the end of the fiscal year. As we look to the future, we are focused on disciplined capital deployment, with work underway to reduce the cost of both new stores and renovations without compromising a warm, welcoming community coffeehouse environment. Shifting to the margin, our Q3 consolidated operating margin was 10.1%, contracting 650 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage and investments in support of Back-to-Starbucks, including additional labor hours and Leadership Experience 2025.\nShifting to G&A, in Q3, G&A increased by 18% versus the prior year, driven by our investment in Leadership Experience 2025. This event was a galvanizing moment for our coffeehouse leaders, and they returned to the communities inspired to take action and deliver world-class customer service across our stores in North America. Q3 EPS was $0.50, down 45% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of expense deleverage and our Back-to-Starbucks investments, including labor and Leadership Experience 2025. Our effective tax rate was higher this quarter due to a discrete tax item in the quarter as we optimized cash deployment across markets.\nThis, combined with the Leadership Experience investment, drove approximately $0.11 of our Q3 EPS decline on a year-over-year basis. To conclude my remarks on our Q3 results, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and disciplined capital investment, maintaining our strong balance sheet and BBB plus BAA1 credit rating, and returning cash to shareholders via dividends. While we have not provided official guidance for the year, I'd like to offer some preliminary thoughts on our broader outlook and the shape of Q4.\nAs Brian said, we continue to make the most of the existing innovation plans and believe we have a strong fall platform, including the return of our popular Pumpkin Spice Latte that overlays the transformative work taking place on the company, brand, and customer experience. Taking into account that we have a lot in flight, combined with the uncertain consumer environment, we are conservative on how the current year-over-year trends will change in Q4 for the US company-operated business. We know we lose the benefit of ticket and that transactions are improving. Just where they will net out is unclear.\nWe are pleased to be ahead of schedule with key foundational programs like Green Apron Service, and we are confident that 2026 will continue to improve as we see the effects of our Back-to-Starbucks strategy begin to scale. Both the tariff environment and coffee prices continue to be dynamic. We continue to mitigate expected tariff exposure outside of green coffee and are pleased to see green coffee prices moderate. We have also increased our coffee coverage relative to last quarter as prices have declined. Due to our coffee buying and hedging practices, you should expect to see both moving average coffee costs and coffee tariff impacts lag the market, with year-over-year coffee cost increases expected to peak in the first half of fiscal 2026.\nOur margins in the near term are impacted by critical investments in our stores, partners, and customers. However, the early signs of progress we're seeing in partner engagement, transactions in our critical day parts, and customer feedback give us confidence that these investments will yield the returns to drive much healthier margins over time. As we progress on our Back-to-Starbucks strategy, we will invest over $0.5 billion of additional labor hours into our US company-operated portfolio over the next year, beginning with our Green Apron Service rollout in mid-August.\nTo offset these investments, we are focusing on driving a healthier and more efficient cost structure that allows us to weather macro headwinds, drive strong sales flow-through, and simultaneously fund our Back-to-Starbucks strategy. We are working on resetting and improving our cost structure across the entire P&L with disciplined prioritization, driving more efficiency, accountability, and agility into the organization. In closing, I'm impressed with how far we've come and know we have more work to do. We know this turnaround is a multi-year effort. We are rebuilding our core foundation on which we can scale and innovate to deliver the best of Starbucks customer experience while instilling stronger discipline in our cost structure and capital deployment plans.\nA lot is happening today behind the scenes, and these efforts will come together more visibly by the end of next year. And when they do, I am highly confident that our financial performance will follow, first in our comps, then in our earnings. I'd like to thank our partners around the world for their commitment to transforming Starbucks into the premier customer service organization that all our stakeholders, partners, customers, and shareholders will be proud of. And with that, Brian and I are happy to take your questions. Thank you, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. Your first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is now live.\nHi. Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the early progress. I wanted to ask about the investment you're making in the stores. Thank you, Cathy, for quantifying that, $500 million in labor hours. Can you maybe just frame up some of the cost offsets you mentioned to that number and whether you think it's possible to fully offset that number, whether you're going to need to see sales leverage in addition to the cost offsets to get the right return? I guess, how are you thinking about the overall margin impact from that collective effort?\n\nCatherine Park\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Good afternoon, David. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, let's make sure we understand, though, that the Green Apron Service is a foundational operating model that establishes the repeatable, consistent, scalable standards that we want and need in customer service. And so it's such an important investment. But to answer your question then, we are, as we shared even last quarter, working across the entire P&L. So named it in the prepared remarks, but from cost of goods sold to operating expenses to G&A, the team is taking on both short-term and long-term cost structure efficiency work that we're doing. So we're not ready to quantify the exact offset.\nI would tell you we see lots and lots of opportunity, and we're getting after it. Some of it will start to come together pretty quickly, and some of it is going to take us a little bit longer. What I would tell you is we're working on 26, 27, and 28. So we're putting in the more durable, sustainable activities to make sure we don't just address it once, but we actually address it long-term. What's really exciting, though, is when we start to grow, we'll actually like what comes through to the bottom line when we start to see that top line come through.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nFood Analyst and Restaurant, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Yeah. Just building on what David was just talking about, I guess, conceptually, right now we're in an investment mode, and we can imagine that margins may not be moving up very quickly, might be moving down a little bit here in the near term. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about things evolving longer term. I would imagine there'll be an analyst day where you'll want to go through each of the pieces of this. But just conceptually, do you see the company going back to pre-COVID levels of margin that might be that 17% type margin corporate-wide, that little over 20% in the Americas? Is that reasonable to expect?\nAnd what sort of journey do you think would how long could that take? What are the big things that must get right that you're thinking over the next two or three years that would really get you there if you think you could get back there? Thank you.\n\nCatherine Park\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Starbucks\n\nGood afternoon, David. I'll start, and then I'm sure Brian can add too. First off, you asked about maybe longer-term kind of earnings potential. First off, Brian mentioned it in his remarks. We're excited. We've put a date on the calendar, a time, early 2026. We believe we'll be in a good position to share not just short-term, but really longer-term how we see this company playing out. We're really excited about putting a date out there for the investor day, early 2026. Then, to answer your question around 2019, is that the right benchmark and aspiration? What I would tell you is it's a good guidepost.\nIt helps us to understand what is possible. Obviously, you have to drive top line first and foremost. That's the most important thing. But once we do start to drive the top line, can we set up a cost structure below that that delivers the kinds of profitability that we would expect? And so 2019 is just my best guidepost, our best guidepost right now. We'll see as we approach that guidepost if there's more room past that. But right now, let's look at that as our guidepost. It provides a really clear, if you unpack the P&L, a really clear path to get there. And that's what the team's working on right now is literally that path. And it's going to take a little bit. I'll leave it there.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Hey, David, this is Brian. The only thing I would add is I've gotten this question before around do you think Starbucks over-earned. And as I better understand the business and I see the opportunities in front of us, I don't think that is the case. I think there is tremendous opportunity in front of us where we get the operating foundation in place, and then we put into place the innovation that we know resonates with customers, and then we continue to do the right thing so that our partners are set up for success to deliver the innovation and the ongoing operating model. And as Cathy mentions, we put a really strong focus on our cost structure.\nThe idea then is you build back a better Starbucks. And that's what we're after. So 2019 serves as a good roadmap, but we have aspirations to not only achieve that, but hopefully exceed that. And as we go on this journey, we'll bring you guys along with us. And I look forward to sharing our thoughts on how this all unfolds at the investor day early next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Just on the Green Apron Service thing, obviously, you've sort of accelerated that, it sounds like. Could you talk about sort of how fast you would expect that to spread through the whole company store base, how fast those investments will happen? And I think you talked about at your conference sort of making sure there was an assistant store manager in every location. Is that also part of that 500, or I guess what exactly is sort of included there?\nYeah. Look, so the Green Apron Service model will start rolling out the middle of this month. Obviously, it takes a little bit of time to get it across all our stores and implemented where our rosters are the right size and then deployed correctly. But what we've seen in pilot is it takes a little bit of time for us to get into a rhythm with the new labor that we have on the team. Then it also takes a little bit of time for our customers to recognize that they're getting a different kind of service experience. The good news is once both of those things stick, we see transactions move in the right direction from there.\nSo you heard in my earlier comments what I'm excited about is as the time goes on, we see this building and building and building. And then when you start thinking about the innovation you can layer on top of that, now you're building from a place of strength with innovation as opposed to kind of a place of weakness or trying to recover with innovation. In regard to the assistant managers, that's going to be part of the roster. And it really is an element of, then, I think, staying true to our mission of we want to promote within greater than 90%. And this presents a tremendous opportunity.\nAnd we talked about this at our Leadership Experience, tremendous opportunity for people to grow with Starbucks through the assistant manager role. And so that's what you see unfolding over time is as we get the roster size right, we'll then figure out how we can promote within that roster and within the organization to that assistant manager role, which then nicely sets us up to build a pipeline for the future growth of new stores with managers and so on and so forth. So I'm delighted that Mike and the operating team have just done a really great job of bringing the Green Apron Service model from an idea to true execution that's now scalable.\nAnd now we're in the process of scaling it. So really excited for mid-August to get here, then really excited for us to build on that strong foundation.\nThank you. And your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nMD, Senior Analyst and Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Just a clarification, Brian, on your last comment and then a question about food innovation. So it sounds like actually operational improvements perhaps weren't the primary driver of the sequential improvement transactions, given it takes customers time to sort of appreciate them. So has it been marketing? I know you've invested maybe in more traditional marketing. Or I guess to what do you credit the sequential improvement if the operations are sort of still early days? And then just on food, I think this is the second quarter where you've called out food in Canada. Are there any kind of lessons you can take from that that can be applied to the US?\nBecause I know food feels like it's been an opportunity for a very long time. So just trying to understand what maybe moves the dial on that. Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Thanks, Sara. So yeah, look, to answer your question, on the operating side, I do believe we're operating better as a system. The Green Apron Service model is not across the system yet. But remember, we rolled out the five key moments. We brought forward the condiment bar. We brought forward, obviously, the idea of speed as it relates to less than four minutes in café and also less than four minutes in the drive-through. And this is one of the things that I think is always impressive, is when you give clarity to operating leaders, they understand what the mission is, and then they figure out how best to achieve it.\nWhat the Green Apron Service model does is it takes that and makes it even more consistent, more reliable, and also gives, frankly, our partners more tools to achieve those key customer metrics that we're after over and over again. So we've made operational progress, which I'm really excited about. And I think Green Apron Service then will kind of institutionalize it and become our system. And hopefully, I think we'll become famous for Green Apron Service and be the defining customer service company that I think Starbucks should be. And that's what we're after. That's our mission.\nTo answer your other part of this question, though, I do think our marketing is playing a positive effect on the business. You might have heard in our comments; we're seeing both non-discounted rewards customer transactions pick up, and we're also seeing non-rewards transaction customers increase, and we're up year over year in Q3. So I think we've got a couple of things working in our favor: much better marketing, and I think a stronger operating system right now. And I think we're going to continue to drive against both of those things going forward. So I'm delighted that what you're seeing is people respond to the marketing and the message.\nAnd then I'm also delighted and frankly impressed by our operators on their ability to take a clear message and figure out how to make that happen in their stores. And now we're going to, I think, amplify that with the Green Apron Service model. Food. Oh, food, your question on food. Yeah, the team in Canada is doing a nice job. I was actually just up in Toronto with the team. And up there, they've done some waffles and pancakes. And I think they're just getting ready to do some bagel bites, which are also really exciting. And yeah, of course, there is opportunity for us to figure out what they're doing up in Canada from a food standpoint to figure out what makes sense for us to bring not only to the US, but around the world.\nAnd I would also share with you, I happened to be in London a week or so ago. And the same thing. The team is doing a great job on enhancing their food and their bake case. And this is one of the things I think, frankly, Starbucks has an opportunity in general on is we have 40,000 stores around the world. We have examples of success all over the place. And we're going to do a much better job of taking advantage of where we see success somewhere else in the world and reapply it globally. And so you'll continue to see us figure out how we can leverage these things around the world, share it with our licensed partners, and then, obviously, where it makes sense, bring it into the United States market as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks so much. I wanted to just follow up on the Green Apron Service model. Can you help contextualize anything around the traffic lift that you might be seeing in test stores, whether you're seeing it across day parts, channels that are more significant? And then my actual question is just on the rewards program, which has always been important to the brand's growth. What do you think is missing in the current platform, and what are the key elements of the reimagined program of the future? Thank you.\nYeah. So look, one of the things that's exciting about the Green Apron Service model is, I think you might have heard my remarks. I think it was maybe the first three weeks I was with the company. I had the opportunity to do an earnings call with everybody. One of the things I wanted to do is make sure we won the morning. One of the things we're seeing right out of the gate is those peaks. We're seeing really nice progress. Then we also see growth throughout the day. We still have an opportunity in the afternoon. I think you heard me talk about this. We're going to figure out how we get the right food and the right drinks so that we're more relevant in that afternoon occasion.\nBut early on, not surprising, we said we wanted to win the morning, and we wanted to have a more effective full day of business. And that's what we're seeing out of the Green Apron Service model. So that's where we are. And then to your question on rewards, right now, I'd say the rewards program became too much of a one-size-fits-all and a discounting mechanism as opposed to a program that really recognizes people for their loyalty and builds more engagement. And the feedback we've gotten from customers that are part of it is, \"Hey, if I'm a really big loyal customer, I think there should be more recognition of that.\nAnd if I'm a less frequent customer, we should then set up the program so that it fits for them.\" So you're going to see us really tailoring the system to become more about recognizing the loyalty, recognizing the engagement, and then building the brand through this rewards program as opposed to what I think, unfortunately, became a system of just discounting and a one-size-fits-all. So that's where we're moving toward. And I'm really excited about what that program will entail. And I'm excited that we'll probably be able to show you kind of all the bells and whistles when we're together in February.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nMD and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you so much. There's so much color in the prepared remarks that I'm going to have to read the transcript to catch all of it. But oftentimes, innovation, consistency, speed, and accuracy are oftentimes enemies of one another. So Brian, I guess, how do we handle so much innovation that we talked about in some of your prepared remarks without maybe slowing down or complicating the operations, the coffeehouse experience? And are there any solutions around equipment, or do you have an opportunity to consider splitting the day parts at Starbucks, maybe having some afternoon innovation that really is available only in the afternoon that allows you to focus specifically on the morning? How are you thinking about, I guess, both this opportunity and risk?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Thanks, John, for the question. One of the principles for our innovation is it cannot negatively impact our ability to deliver on café orders less than four minutes, right? The drive-through less than four minutes, and then being on time and accurate with our mobile orders. So that is one of the key entry points for any innovation that we have to do. With that said, what I also think we're doing a much better job of now is making sure that we understand what are the current approaches for how we make drinks, how we prepare food, so that when we do the innovation, we aren't always having to reinvent the process of how you make the drink.\nAnd so I think what you're going to see, John, is it's innovation that is unique. It's what customers have been asking for. It's what meets customer needs. And then we do it in a way where our partners give us feedback so that we're able to execute it consistently and with the right type of throughput. And this is why it's so important that we have this approach of the Starting Five because this innovation is being kind of co-built with our baristas in our stores versus we build it in the support center, we throw it over the wall, and we hope that our baristas can figure it out. Those days are over. The way we're going to do this is we're going to build it together.\nWe're going to build it with the field and our baristas in store at the start of the process. And so it's been very powerful for us. Even the protein platform that we're going to be bringing out later this year is a great example of how we've done just that system where we tapped into our baristas to help us fine-tune the program so that it's executed in a way that can be a great drink every time on the speed requirements that our customers expect. It sets our partners up to be successful with every drink that they're preparing. This is also part of the reason why we had to initially set out on menu simplification.\nYou've got to clear out kind of the low-hanging things that are, frankly, a distraction and taking away people's time so that it frees up space to do meaningful innovation that we know can be executed by our partners in our stores. The Green Apron Service model, hugely important to get that established and set. And we were purposeful to make sure we did that first before we layered in the innovation. But the good news is where we're testing this with the Green Apron Service model, we see our ability to then implement the innovation that we're talking about bringing down the pike. So very excited about what's to come. And I love the fact that these things are built by baristas, and the ideas can come from anywhere. And that's the kind of company we need to be.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. One quick housekeeping first. Just curious, how many Mobile Order and Pay stores are in the portfolio as you go through the process of system optimization? And then my real question is that if I go back early this month, there was an 8K highlighting a bonus contingent on reducing operating expenses through fiscal 2027. Can you help us understand what level of reduction is necessary to hit this?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nSo to answer your first question, it's roughly like 80, 90 stores in the mobile order pickup space. And then on your second question, look, incentives are a powerful tool. And I wanted to have an incentive for the organization to get after the cost side of things. And I think the good news is I'm seeing people galvanized around getting after what these incentives have set out to do. And so you'll see how that unfolds over the, I think, the coming months and coming years. And I think Cathy said it well. We ultimately want a better cost structure so that as we grow, we're happy with how the top line falls to the bottom line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. So Brian, could you talk a little bit about your decision to expedite the rollout of the Green Apron Service model? So were there any notable surprises or key metrics from your earlier tests across the 2,000 stores last quarter that kind of gave you that confidence to proceed with a full rollout in all of the US stores by the end of the summer as opposed to the 1/3 of the stores by then? Additionally, just your thoughts on how you will measure the ongoing success of the model and how you incorporate some feedback from both customers and partners.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks",
    "content2": "Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, it really boils down to how we saw the pilots be able to both hire, train, deploy. It was all about getting the right partners in the right place at the right time. And then also, when you layered in the technology behind it of the SmartQ, which is all about the ordering algorithm, we saw how that was effective. And then, not surprising, what we also saw is we saw a nice movement in transactions in the day parts that I talked about earlier, both the morning and for the whole day. And then I also think I mentioned this in my remarks. We've gotten clarity on what are the key metrics that ultimately drive performance.\nAnd that's our growth scorecard that we're going to be adopting going forward. And so you'll see us continue to talk about that ongoing. You're not going to be surprised. It's about the customer. It's about our being staffed correctly. It's about ensuring that we obviously get the right speed requirements hit. And so when we do those things, we see the outcomes that we want, which is transaction growth, which then ultimately, I think, is a key indicator of health in the business. So we loved what we saw. Mike and the team demonstrated that we had the ability to scale it. And so we were like, \"You know what? The time is right.\"\nBecause I'd love the fact that we're going to get this Green Apron Service model in place before we hit Pumpkin Spice Latte, our big fall holiday season. There's going to be a lot of customers that come into our business because of those two marquee moments. Now they're going to experience Green Apron Service. And I just think that's a winning proposition for us that sets the table for what's to come in 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Brian, just a question on the US business. Investors often express concern around a few things that could limit return to outsized US comp growth, whether it's US competition from above or below, your unit count penetration maybe being already elevated, and value perception. I'm just wondering, what do you perceive as the greatest challenge among those? It does seem like, based on your comments, maybe these things aren't concerns internally. So I'm just looking for your thoughts on the implications from competition penetration and value perception. Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, I think one of the most important things you do with a consumer-facing company is making sure that the brand is perceived to be valuable. And one of the things I was really delighted to see is we've made tremendous progress on that value front. And I think it's the highest level we've had in the last two years. And so I'm very focused on how are we driving this brand to be more valuable for our customers tomorrow because I think that's how you have to think. It's like maybe we were good today, but we need to be even better tomorrow. And I think the Green Apron Service model is a foundational element because if we become the great customer service company that I know we can be consistently, there's tremendous value in that.\nNobody else does it. It's uniquely something Starbucks has always stood for in the past. I think it's uniquely something we can own going forward. Look, the best way I know to compete is to be the best form of yourself. That best form of Starbucks is, without a doubt, world-class customer service driven by the connection between our barista and our customer with the craft of our drinks in a special third place. So that makes this brand super valuable to every customer and every partner that's a part of this company. That's what I'm focused on. I love playing offense in a very competitive environment.\nYou know what? We're in competitive environments all around the world. You're going to continue to see Starbucks be on the offensive as it relates to great connection, great community, and great craft.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please state your question.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nMD, Stifel\n\nYeah. Thanks. Brian, I was hoping you could expand on your thinking around the China business just for a moment. I mean, the company has been clear it's looking for a partner, but I was hoping you could elaborate on exactly what you believe you would gain from a strategic relationship. I mean, it doesn't look like capital is really an issue when you consider the investments that need to be made in that market. But so I'm just wondering, is the primary goal to bring in maybe better expertise in operations or marketing in China? Or what would you consider a win for Starbucks, I guess?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, I think the good news is our brand is well-respected, held in high regard with the Chinese customer. Our team has been doing a really nice job, I think, figuring out how to compete in a new environment, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. As we look at the partners that have come forward, what we are hoping we can have is a partner, first of all, that shares our mission and value. It's got to be a consistent approach to our mission and values. Then I think be a great partner to figure out how we can operate more effectively in that local market. Because it's not about capital.\nWhat this is about is how do we ensure that the Starbucks brand is in a much better place in the future? Because I do believe there's going to be thousands of more Starbucks in China. I think there's no reason why this can't be one of the best businesses in China. And so we're looking for a partner that shares that passion and shares that belief that there's this opportunity to grow one of the special brands in China. And we think having somebody that's a local partner sets us up to ensure that is the case for the Starbucks brand long-term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question.\n\nJon Tower\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Brian, circling back to a topic you kind of hit on a little bit earlier on value. And specifically, I know in previous calls you talked about the idea of looking at the menu architecture and the pricing architecture. And I'm just curious, with a lot of the innovation that you outlined earlier in the call, I'm just curious how you're thinking about maybe how value fits into the new products that are coming out next year. Are you thinking about different cup sizes that are coming through specifically and price points around that? And then on top of that, how are you thinking about incremental pricing beyond this fourth quarter and into 2026 in aggregate?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Yeah. Obviously, as we bring out the innovation, we want the innovation to be relevant for the day part that we're going after and the occasion that we're going after. So in some cases, that may mean a smaller size. In some cases, it may mean we think differently about where that price falls within our menu architecture. So obviously, it's important. We all remember the old marketing class we took, right? I can't remember if it's four Ps or five Ps, but one of the Ps is definitely price. And we got to make sure that for the customer experience, and here's the one thing I think it's really important to remember, everything we do will be valuable.\nWe are a premium brand that gives people access to premium experiences. And so this is not about changing that trajectory of our business. With that said, there are different ways to execute both the size and the package that you experience, whether it's an afternoon snack or an afternoon pick-me-up or customizing your energy, customizing your protein. There are a lot of different ways for us to think about how we bring value to the customer in a premium way. And so that's very much top of mind for us. And I think it's critical for us to continue to be positioned correctly for every occasion. And what was the second part of your question?\n\nCatherine Park\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Starbucks\n\nPricing.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nIt has to do with pricing. Yeah. Pricing in the future. Yeah. Look, I think you've heard me say this all the time, and I still fundamentally believe this is pricing is always the last lever I like to pull. But with that said, pricing will be a part of our business model. There are times where it makes sense to take some price. And when those situations present itself, we're going to do it in the least amount of pricing necessary. I prefer to always hold back on that one as much as possible. So will we have to use it in the future? Absolutely. It's going to be the last lever I'd like to pull. And when we pull that lever, I probably want to do as little as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The last question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Great. Thank you.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nBrian, I'd like to go back to a couple of topics that you were hinting before, specifically like competition. At some point, Cathy was also talking about the potential macro pressures in the fourth quarter. With great progress on a sequential basis on traffic, sequential improvement on traffic, but it still remains negative on a one-year basis. How do you assess that the contraction was actually driven by the lapping of promotions rather than perhaps consumer finding alternatives that could be either potentially evolving competitive landscape or consumers switching to coffee consumption at home? Given your assessment, out of all the initiatives that you have been launching, which one do you think is going to be the most critical one to be driving consumers back to stores? Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Well, look, I think it's a combination of things that's going to ultimately bring customers consistently back to our stores. But I do believe getting the foundation right with the Green Apron Service model is mission-critical and step one. And then obviously, having relevant innovation that puts us in front of culture and in culture is hugely important. And you've heard me outline it. That innovation is going to go from menu across beverage and food to digital to rewards. So I think that's our success platform that we're going to continue to drive towards. And we'll talk more about it at our Investor Day.\nIn regard to the macros and what we see in the business, look, one of the things I was delighted to see is that we continue to see sequential improvements in transactions. And as we exited the quarter, we continue to see that so we just, right now, obviously, are still figuring our way through these initiatives that are in flight. And until everything's in place, you have some ups and downs as you move through the quarter. I think the good news for us is I think a lot of the opportunity of growth is in our control. And I think that's what I've asked our team to stay focused on is what are the things we can control? We do that to the best of our ability.\nWe will continue to grow share, and we will build a brand that's beloved. And that's what we're after. I can't control some of the other forces that are out there, but I can bring the best Starbucks in whatever environment we have to compete in. And that's what we're going to stay focused on, Daniela. It's served me well over my last 20 years working in this industry. I've seen a lot. The good news is, what I see always working is make sure that you value every customer, you set your partners up for success, and then you stay on the offensive for your brand. That's how you come out on the other side, a stronger, better business.\nThat's what we're focused on right now. Obviously, we're still turning this business around. When you're in a turnaround, there are some unexpected things that happen. I think we're smart to make sure that we're honest about that. The reality is I believe we're working on the right things, and whatever comes our way, we'll handle accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol for closing remarks.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining the call. Thank you for the questions. Thanks for all the time. Obviously, you heard in my remarks and hopefully through this Q&A how genuinely proud I am of this team, both our partners in our stores as well as our partners here in the office with me on working through this turnaround. As we kind of close out this conversation, this quarter was really all about laying the operational foundation for Starbucks. Our point is we want a Starbucks that's not only stronger and more resilient now, but we're ready to start innovating and innovating at scale in 2026.\nSo obviously, we're making some significant investments in our Green Apron partners and in the operational foundations that support them. The rollout of our Green Apron Service model is really our most ambitious operational transformation to date. But I'm really excited about the early signs of success that we're seeing. And we're also, I think, going to continue to reset our coffeehouse portfolio strategy. We're prioritizing warmth, connection, and community. And I'm really excited about what I'm seeing in the uplifts that we've started to do and how we're creating the coffeehouse of the future with the new building that we're going to be building going forward.\nIt's really energizing, frankly, to partner with this new leadership team. I'm confident in the strength and vision of this group of leaders. And I'm really excited for what we're going to accomplish together. So all of this work, every investment, all the operational changes, all about helping us build the best Starbucks and one that is ultimately grounded in purpose, powered by our partners, and positioned to lead with innovation in the years ahead. So I'm proud of the progress we've made. I'm really confident in our path forward. Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program. I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\nAnd that comes out 26 August. And quickly thereafter, you'll see us innovating with our Protein Cold Foam and our protein platform. So couldn't be prouder of where we are. As I mentioned in my comments, I do feel like, as I've been a part of a lot of these turnarounds, we're ahead of schedule where I would have thought we would have been. And I think that's evidenced by the fact of rather than rolling out Green Apron Service model to just a couple thousand stores, we're going to be putting it in all our stores. So excited about what's to come and excited to be able to share even more of these details in our next quarterly call and then, obviously, at our investor day. So thank you, everybody. Take care.\nThis concludes Starbucks' third quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. You may now disconnect."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you for joining today. Seven months ago, we began work on our Back to Starbucks strategy. Since then, we've learned a lot, and we've moved quickly amid changing market dynamics to reset our business and our team to focus on the customer and our Green Apron Partners who serve them. Learnings to date tell me a few things. First, we now have the right leaders in place to lead a customer-driven culture and to drive our turnaround.\nSecond, my optimism has turned into confidence that our Back to Starbucks plan is the right strategy to turn the business around and to unlock opportunities ahead. We're relentlessly focused on the customer, and we're continuing to invest in a Green Apron Service Model that enables throughput and connection with our customers. We're also reestablishing our coffee houses as a Third Place where customers spend time and build community.\nThird, we're not just building back our business. We're building back a better business. I know from experience that when you focus relentlessly on the customer, you take care of your people, improve your operations, and carefully manage costs, the financial results will follow. We're already seeing tangible progress and positive signs from the work we are doing to test, learn, and then quickly scale.\nOur goal is that every transaction is higher quality and more profitable. Current market dynamics have given us even more focus and conviction to get Back to Starbucks. We don't know what the state of the consumer will be in the months to come, but I'm confident we're building a globally resilient business rooted in the strength of our brand, focused on the customer, and enabled by world-class partners at the local level that can succeed in any economic environment.\nOur turnaround is on track, and I see more opportunity than I imagined. Turning to performance for the quarter, total company revenue was $8.8 billion, with a global net new store growth of 213 coffee houses, a global comparable store sales decline of 1%, a global operating margin of 8.2%, and overall earnings per share of $0.41.\nThese results are far below our capability, but I believe they will be temporary because there is so much opportunity in front of us. I also believe there are better measures than EPS right now to track the progress we're making to turn around the business. We have started to make disciplined investments across the four pillars of our Back to Starbucks plan: in partners, coffee houses, the customer experience, and our marketing and menu.\nWe're also focused on managing costs and improving our financial fundamentals so that as growth returns, we capture more of every dollar spent in our coffee houses. We're already starting to see early indicators of recovery in our North America business. Partner engagement is up, turnover has dropped to under 50%, which is a new recorded low, transaction declines are slowing across every day part, quality transactions are driving more of our sales, and the customer experience continues to improve.\nFinally, our Canadian business has returned to positive comps with positive transaction growth. Let me walk you through why I'm more confident than ever in our Back to Starbucks plan and the work we're doing. Number one, our success starts and ends with our customers and our Green Apron Partners.\nOver the past quarter, I've spent a lot of time in our coffee houses meeting with partners and listening to customers. You can feel the excitement. Our Back to Starbucks plan is the change our partners have been looking for. They're bought in, and they're leading a green wave of hospitality. We've put the focus back on our customers, and we've centered our work on supporting our Green Apron Partners so they can deliver an exceptional customer experience. It's the right thing to do for our partners, our customers, and the business.\nDuring the quarter, we launched an update to Shift Marketplace that lets partners pick up and trade shifts within their district. It's increased the pool of partners to fill last-minute shift changes by 10 times and has resulted in record-high shift completion, with a half a million more shifts filled year over year.\nThis translates into more moments of connection with our customers, higher transaction capture, and a better experience for our partners. As a result, turnover is the lowest on record, and tenure is on the rise, resulting in more capable, proficient partners. To help our leaders develop and take ownership of the experiences they create in their coffee houses, we're getting North America store managers together for a leadership conference this June. Number two, we are the community coffee house.\nWe've moved quickly over the past several months to make small but impactful improvements to the coffee house experience. We're creating moments of connection with handwritten notes on cups, and we're making it more enticing to stay in our cafes with ceramic mugs, an expanded free refill policy, and the return of great seats.\nAs a result, we've seen more customers choose to sit and stay in our cafes, and we continue to receive overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers, demonstrating that small details and hospitality drive satisfaction. The Third Place is our heritage. It's needed more than ever, and we're reclaiming it. That's why we're evolving our coffee house design standards to provide customers a welcoming space to connect and build community. We'll begin to bring reworked coffee houses online soon, and we think they will truly deliver an exceptional experience.\nThe uplifts feel premium but keep renovation costs down and minimize closure days. They're warm and invite customers in. They create a sense of craft, and they have great seats for different occasions. Expect to see these uplifts begin to open in New York City and Southern California in the months ahead. While we still see long-term potential to double our overall US footprint, we have to improve the health of our portfolio.\nAs a first step, we're taking a critical look at our current portfolio to ensure every coffee house we operate provides a great customer experience. We're beginning the work to build a stronger long-term development pipeline that is better mapped to growth markets and delivers improved unit economics. Number three, delivering the customer experience to win the peaks. Using a test and scale approach to win the peaks, we're shifting our focus from beverage production to craft and connection.\nWe're finding through our work that investments in labor rather than equipment are more effective at improving throughput and driving transaction growth. Learnings last quarter came from a 700 coffee house staffing and deployment pilot. It confirmed that the right staffing, combined with the right deployment, improves speed of service and connection while growing transactions.\nWe also began testing a new order sequencing algorithm. It proved effective in reducing in-cafe and drive-through service times without impacting the mobile order experience. In test locations, average cafe wait times dropped by an average of two minutes, bringing 75% of cafe order wait times under four minutes at peak. Building on feedback from partners and these learnings, we're investing strategically in labor to optimize our operations, bring back a premium experience, and better support our partners throughout the peak and the balance of the day.\nBeginning in May, we'll scale a new Green Apron Service Model to more than 2,000 of our US company-operated locations and to more than 1/3 of our US coffee houses by the end of this fiscal year. This new model combines and unifies new service standards and expectations, changes to partner plays and deployment, streamlined routines, and our order sequencing algorithm.\nI'm confident, based on our pilot work and spending time with store managers and Green Apron Partners across the country, that this new model would create more flexibility within our operation, improve peak throughput, better capture demand, deliver a more premium customer experience, and accelerate transaction growth. As we improve partner deployment and the technology supporting them, we're also rethinking our approach to equipment development and deployment.\nWe've paused the continued rollout of our CapEx-heavy Siren cold and food equipment, and have chosen not to move forward with the deployment of Cold Press Cold Brew equipment. We believe this evolved labor-focused approach has more potential to improve throughput and connection while minimizing future capital expenditures on equipment. Looking forward, we're on track to fully roll out Clover Vertica Brewers in the US with equipment already installed in 70% of our company-operated coffee houses.\nThis summer, we'll begin to push an update to the Starbucks app that lets customers schedule their mobile order pickup and improves price transparency throughout the order process. Number four, reintroduce the Starbucks experience to the world. We're reintroducing the Starbucks experience to the world through a focus on brand and coffee storytelling and an overhauled approach to product innovation.\nWe kicked off Q2 with a new US brand campaign and tied to the launch, Starbucks Monday invited customers into our coffee houses for a free brewed coffee after the big game. It generated record-breaking customer engagement and drove our second highest Monday gross sales day ever. Customers are also responding to our new ads. Within the quarter, our data shows that the percentage of customers ranking Starbucks as their first choice is the highest it's been in two years.\nOn social media, too, our new fan-focused approach has increased engagement on TikTok by nearly 3x, quarter-over-quarter. Turning to our menu, we've continued to rationalize and update our product lineup to focus on coffee and craft, and to create room for relevant innovation that drives demand. In response to customer feedback, we recently removed sugar from our Matcha, lifting Matcha sales by nearly 40% versus last year.\nWe launched a new coffee-forward Cortado platform, which has quickly become a popular core offering. We continue to educate customers on the range of premium coffee we serve, building on the strength of our Clover Vertica Brewer. In the near term, we're making the most out of our beverage pipeline.\nThis summer, we're bringing back the best-selling Summer Berry Refreshers with pearls, launching the new limited-time Iced Horchata Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, and bringing new innovation to our Frappuccino platform. In the longer term, we're using an agile test-and-learn approach to build a culturally relevant innovation pipeline across beverage and food. To do this, we're developing enduring platforms that reshape the business and create long-term potential for the brand.\nIn the coming months, we'll begin to pilot innovations that are sales-driving, brand-building, and can be executed consistently. Work is underway to craft artisanal food, including the exploration of ways to freshly bake, assemble, and serve certain items in our cafes at scale. We're using learnings from the launch of freshly baked and prepared items in the UK and other international markets to inform our test-and-scale approach in the US.\nNext, we're exploring how to lead in health and wellness with a new platform that resonates across demographics, which we expect to launch later this year. We're looking at new beverages that create an entry point to our craft coffee and drink experiences. To help reclaim the Third Place and boost the afternoon day part, we're also exploring an aperitivo menu that includes sparkling beverages, sippable coffee drinks, and snackable bites.\nLastly, we're beginning to move towards a more regular cadence of limited-time flavor launches inspired by baristas and our biggest fans. It's early days, but we're moving quickly to improve the appeal of our product pipeline and to support real-time, culturally relevant menu innovation. Finally, we remain on track with the rollout of Digital Menu Boards, which are already in more than 25% of our US company-operated coffee houses.\nThey're a key unlock to market day parts differently and to introduce innovation that isn't tied to our seasonal product cycles. Turning to international, Starbucks has built a globally beloved brand supported by a business that is executed locally in every country and every community where we operate. In a fast-changing environment, this model, underpinned by our Back to Starbucks plan, improves our resiliency and has proven effective in both challenging and good times.\nIn the Q2, eight of our top 10 international markets returned to flat comp or comp growth. In the UK, we posted positive comps and have started gaining market share with great feedback on our fresh baked launch. In the Middle East, our regional business partner returned to positive transaction comps for the quarter.\nIn Japan, the business posted their 16th consecutive quarter of comp growth and has increased both brewed coffee and espresso comps through a focus on the coffee house experience. To support our continued recovery and future growth, we're using learnings from international markets to inform our test-and-scale approach across our global footprint.\nWe're building on the success of our US brand campaign to localize and extend our marketing across key international markets. In China, we've also seen indicators of progress following near-term changes to our product offerings, including the introduction of true-taste sugar-free beverages and new price points on select products. We've got more work to do in the market, but our brand remains strong. Our business is supported by a supply chain and roasting operation that is almost entirely local, and our team continues to make progress on a market-specific Back to Starbucks plan.\nAs we see signs of progress, I want to be clear that we remain committed to China for the long-term. We see great potential for our business there in the years ahead and remain open to how we achieve that growth. Lastly, we continue to extend the reach of our brand beyond the walls of our coffee houses with our global channel business. During the quarter, we delivered relevant innovation to customers at home and on the move, including a new line of iced energy and Frappuccino-like beverages in partnership with PepsiCo.\nIn summary, our Q2 results are disappointing, especially as measured by EPS, but behind the scenes, we made a lot of progress and have real momentum with our Back to Starbucks plan. I've led other turnarounds, and everything I've seen tells me we're on the right track.\nI believe we have incredible opportunity in front of us that will create tremendous value for all stakeholders. At this stage in our turnaround, EPS shouldn't be used as a measure of our success. We're testing and learning with speed, and where we're seeing real change is in our coffee houses. As we scale this work across our full footprint, combined with the strength of our brand, we know we can return the business to strong, profitable growth.\nIf you take away anything from today's call, let it be this: we are putting the customer back at the center of all we do. We're setting our Green Apron Partners up for success with the best job in retail. We've got the right team in place to lead. We're confident we have the right strategy and are making the right investments to unlock opportunities ahead.\nWe see evidence of progress from the work we're testing and scaling, which we believe will lead to improvements in our financial results. Some of the investments we're making now will take some time to create material returns, and some elements of our plan will move faster than others.\nAs we continue to build and invest in our Back to Starbucks plan, we'll keep looking for material offsets, learning from our customers and partners, and adjusting our tactics to return the business to growth.There is important work ahead, and I look forward to bringing you along. With that, I'd like to introduce and welcome Cathy Smith, our new Chief Financial Officer, to share some detail on our results for the quarter.\n\nCathy Smith\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I have been a huge Starbucks fan for many years and am super excited to be here. Starbucks has been my Third Place for countless meetings and interviews and a landing spot when I had time to reflect. Somewhere I could go and know I'd find a welcoming barista, delicious beverages, and a warm coffee house experience. In my short time in this role, it is clear there are substantial opportunities for growth and value creation. Like Brian, I am confident the four pillars of the Back to Starbucks strategy are right.\nI have seen this pattern before: develop the right focus strategy, test, learn, iterate, focus on the leading indicators, look for signs of progress, work on cost per transaction, then move to scale. The desired financial results will take a while, but I have started to see the leading indicators and early evidence that precede all turnarounds.\nWe'll maintain the discipline to ensure small investments yield expected outcomes before scaling in service of long-term durable growth and strong returns on invested capital. I also know that the turnaround is going to take some time. We are committed to providing transparency along the journey. I'll now cover our Q2 results. Our Q2 consolidated revenue was $8.8 billion, up 3% in constant currency to the prior year, reflecting 7% net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by a 1% decline in comparable store sales.\nOur global comparable store sales decline was primarily due to a 2% decline in the US, with our US transaction decline improving this quarter to -4%. While transactions are not where we expect them to be, we are seeing several indicators that our Back to Starbucks strategy is positioning the business on the right track.\nIn the US, market share, brand sentiment, and customer contacts regarding wait times are all improving. We saw stabilization in our non-Starbucks Rewards member traffic, indicating our broad-based marketing campaign to reintroduce Starbucks to the world is resonating with our customers. Additionally, transaction recovery in our comparable stores was strongest in our morning day part, and we saw improvement quarter-over-quarter as we have invested in staffing and deployment, demonstrating that the delivery of the customer experience to win the peaks pillar of our Back to Starbucks strategy is effective.\nOur ticket growth in the US for the quarter was 3%, reflecting annualization of prior year pricing and fewer discount-driven offers in the current year. We are driving more durable growth by moving away from highly discounted offers, building the foundation of a healthier base business to grow from.\nOutside the US, Canada experienced both positive comparable store sales and transaction comp in the quarter. Our Canadian market has benefited from food innovation that has resonated with customers, fueling 12.5% higher food sales. Shifting to China, China's comparable store sales were flat for the quarter, with positive transactions and expanding margins, driven by their focus on delivering great product innovation and improving value perception.\nAdditionally, customer and partner engagement scores improved year over year. In our international segment, we're seeing faster improvement, as evidenced by eight of the top 10 markets with flat or positive comps. Our international cafes are starting their Back to Starbucks plan from a more consistent brand experience. It's early, but it's encouraging to see positive signs. Turning to store growth, we opened 213 net new stores globally in Q2, primarily consisting of company-operated growth in the US and China.\nWhile we have solid new store economics, we have room for improvement and are evaluating our global store portfolio and new store pipeline, as Brian mentioned. Our cafes will have authentic coffee house vibes with customers in mind. Our core model will have both cafe and drive-thru, with welcoming environments and efficient workflow behind the bar.\nWe are also committed to reducing our new store build costs to drive greater new store returns. Shifting to margin, our Q2 consolidated operating margin was 8.2%, contracting 450 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage and additional labor in support of our Back to Starbucks strategy. Our strategic and surgical addition of labor into our stores is critical for us to deliver the customer connection and experience our customers expect.\nWhile we prioritize delivering on our customer promise, we are optimizing workflow, driving efficiencies with new algorithms, simplifying our menu, and improving the layout. Although our labor investments drove margin compression in the quarter, the investment in labor allows us to capture additional demand and transactions, which will accelerate our return to growth. Shifting from margin to G&A.\nIn Q2, G&A declined by 3% versus the prior year, driven by the lapping of certain proxy solicitation and advisory costs and cost savings from the corporate restructuring we completed towards the end of the quarter. Last quarter, we shared our intention to include these restructuring costs in our Non-GAAP results. Considering the stage of our turnaround, we may have additional restructuring costs in the near term as we evaluate our store portfolio and operations.\nHowever, we still expect that any additional restructuring initiatives will be completed within a finite period of time and therefore have elected to exclude the corporate restructuring charges from our non-GAAP results. As Brian stated, our EPS performance in the quarter was poor. Q2 EPS was $0.41, down 38% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of expense deleverage and heightened store investments.\nThat said, our considerable progress against our Back to Starbucks strategy might be more telling at this stage of our turnaround than EPS. We've made tangible progress on all four of our Back to Starbucks pillars, and while the strategy will take time to be fully implemented and produce financial returns, we are laying the foundation for profitable, durable growth.\nTo conclude my remarks on our Q2 results, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and continue to invest in our business for high returns, maintain our strong balance sheet targeting a BBB plus BAA1 credit rating, and return cash to shareholders via dividends. Shifting to broader topics, while I know you would like to have some insight into our financial outlook, I'm still learning the business, and it would be premature for me to provide such insight.\nAlthough I expect our Q3 FY 2025 top line to follow normal seasonality, I recognize our US business drives our results, and it will take time for our Back to Starbucks strategies to be fully implemented in our over 17,000 stores nationally. I know that our shareholders have many questions top of mind, so I will address two topics in detail: tariffs and coffee prices.\nStarting with tariffs, although the tariff environment continues to be dynamic, we mobilized a cross-functional team and are actively managing and mitigating risks where possible. As it relates to coffee, I'd like to first remind everyone that we source high-quality Arabica coffee from 28 countries, with the majority of our supply coming from Latin America. Our coffee team is leveraging our global footprint to further diversify and redirect coffee shipments as appropriate.\nExcluding coffee, our largest areas of tariff exposure include merchandise currently sourced from China and some imported beverage components. For these impacted areas, we are actively working on strengthening our supply chain, including localizing and moving production as needed. For example, for the upcoming holiday season, we have made progress mitigating our tariff exposure by shifting production to alternate sites.\nNow shifting to coffee prices, the market continues to be volatile, and our coffee team has done a fantastic job opportunistically building our supply and securing favorable pricing. Due to our purchasing and hedging practices, our moving average cost of coffee lags the market. As a reminder, our total cost of green coffee is typically limited to 10% to 15% of our product and distribution costs, and we continue to actively manage and balance coffee inventory with related coffee costs.\nIn closing, while our financial results are far from Starbucks' potential, I am confident we have the right strategy and are starting to see early evidence and leading indicators. We are building new muscles to test, iterate, and scale quickly, all while focused on customers and listening to partners. I want to thank our partners who are dedicated to bringing our Back to Starbucks strategy to life. Working alongside you, I have confidence that we will deliver the experience customers crave and value creation our shareholders deserve. With that, Brian and I are happy to take your questions. Thank you. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. Our first question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nRestaurant and Food Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I just want to follow up on some of those points that you made in the opening comments. You mentioned investments in labor and order sequencing, perhaps over equipment in terms of solving speed and throughput, and so I'm just thinking this through.\nIt sounds like maybe more OpEx and less CapEx than what you might have thought originally, and perhaps this is going to be more of a rapid pace to the improvement that you want to get to. It's going to be more easily deployed. Are there any numbers that we can think about in terms of labor investment, maybe per store CapEx thinking that you would be associated with this, maybe less than before? Then anything else that you can think of that would be important from a staging perspective because it sounds like a lot of changes are happening. Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Hey, David, it's Brian. Yeah, thanks for the question. Look, I think your instincts are right. What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment, and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve both in cafe, mobile order, and drive-thru.\nWe're not seeing the need for the equipment in order to get to the customer experience that we want to provide, both on the level of speed and connection. Then, look, I think what we're doing as far as taking from pilot to scale, I can kind of share with you kind of the journey we've been on so far.\nI started with three stores on the algorithm, started in five stores with the labor pilot, and now we'll be in roughly 1,500 stores, close to 2,000 stores by, I think, May. Then hopefully by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be over 3,000 stores with the labor program and the algorithm program. This just allows us to get to, I think, the service experience that we want to provide across the stores at a pace that we think makes sense so that we train, we staff, meaning we hire, and then we're able to deploy correctly and then put in the technology behind it.\nThe other thing that's nice to see is we're seeing transactions respond with the improved speed of service and the better, I'd call it, deployment/staffing to enable the connection and the speed that we want. I think that gives you a highlight on it. It's probably too early to say what will be the actual speed and the cost associated with it. The one thing I would say is, and I think you heard this in Cathy's comments and my comments, is we're going to be also looking to make sure that we are very judicious in the costs that continue to go forward in the business.\nBecause as we make these investments into the store, we're going to see where we can find material offsets in the business. Then obviously, we're banking on some growth to come with the investment in the labor and the store experience. I highly, highly believe margin then ultimately responds to, and the financial results grow with the growth of the business.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nRestaurant and Food Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYour next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on your last comment, which is about the margin. Margin was down in North America. It looks like most of that 600 basis points was from labor. I know you talked about that as a headwind, I guess. I'm trying to understand. It feels like Starbucks has been investing pretty heavily in labor for a few years now. I'm not sure if this is what we're seeing before you see some of the offsets or if fundamentally the economics of the box maybe looks different than it has historically. I'm just trying to sort of piece together.\nIt's a little slower in terms of earnings recovery than maybe some of the previous turnarounds we've seen from you, Brian. I can't tell if it's a macro issue or if there's something else here that, again, says that the boxes are going to be sort of fundamentally different than they used to be.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Look, I think what's been going on in the kind of, if you look back on the history, we've definitely invested in our, I would call it, our employee value proposition or the partner value proposition. I think along those lines, over the last couple of years, we've actually been removing labor from the stores, I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labor. I think what we're finding is that was just, that wasn't an accurate assumption with what played out. Unfortunately, at the same time, price was being taken up for a myriad of reasons, right?\nThere was an inflationary environment, so on and so forth. I think where we find ourselves right now is what we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does. Then what we're already starting to see is an impact on that transaction and the number of transactions that are incremental. I think the combination of coming over top with marketing as well to talk about the experience of the Starbucks coffee company combined with the in-store experience as it relates to technology and staffing, we're already starting to see some nice improvements. Just to kind of give you what I talk about there, it's like our non-rewards customers; we've seen a nice clip up in transactions.\nObviously, our rewards customers, where we've removed a lot of the discounting, we're seeing a lot of choppiness there because we, frankly, were using our rewards program more as a coupon program as opposed to a rewards program. You're going to see us evolve that program going forward. The quality of the transactions that we're building back look better. It's not discount-based. I would say it's kind of the core of what Starbucks is. It's experience-based. It's coffee-quality-based.\nIt's drink-based. I like where we're headed. I think we're going to build back with better transactions, which sets us up for, I think, some great growth going forward. I think margins will be part of that growth story in the longer term. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi. Good afternoon. My question is about the portfolio comments you made evaluating the portfolio. I was wondering if you could elaborate specifically on what you're evaluating there in terms of the existing base. Then, I guess, Brian, should we think about a slower pace of unit growth in the near term that eventually accelerates later as you do this evaluation, or are you going to continue to grow as you do this evaluation?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThanks. Yeah. Thanks, David, for the question. To answer the first part of your question, look, we have seen our cost go way up on our new builds as well as our renovations. It's just not the cost structure we think we should have going forward, nor do I think it's necessary to have a great build and give the customer experience and the partner experience that we need to provide.\nWe're working hard on how we reset both renovation costs as well as new build costs. With that, it's only logical to say, \"Well, why don't we slow down what we're building right now?\" Then as we get the new design and build nailed down, we will ramp our way back up. Because as I said in my comments earlier, we still believe there's tremendous opportunity to double the store count from where we are today. I just want to double it with the right build at the right cost so that we can provide the right customer experience and the right partner experience. That's what we're working on right now.\nActually, before I even hopped on this call, I had the opportunity to look at something that I think is pretty exciting for how we're going to have much better cost in what we build. It takes a little bit of time to move that through the development pipeline so that it shows up in market. I love where the team is headed on the cost side of this. I also love where the team is headed on the design side of this. Then when you layer that in with, I think, a great Third Place, the right labor, staffing, deployment, and some technology behind it to enable the speed and throughput that we want, I have high confidence that we can double the store count, as I've mentioned before.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you comment on just the menu simplification you did? I think the thought before was that that wouldn't have too much of an impact on transactions and people sort of gravitate to other items. Is that, in fact, what you saw? Then you did sort of tease some other interesting things that could come over time from an innovation perspective. How do you sort of sequence those things and how will you think about when is the right time for that?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah. Well, look, just on the transaction front, we still believe we're making the right decisions by simplifying because it frees us up to do what I believe is more like platform innovation, more compelling and relevant innovation, frankly, versus hanging on to what I would say just slow movers that I'm sure there's somebody that wishes we didn't remove it, but they were slow movers.\nWe got to open space up so that we can have the big movers. To your point on transactions, one of the things that gives me a lot of optimism is just if you think about from Q1 to Q2, the percent of stores that had positive transaction comp went up by like 80%. We went from, call it, 13.5% of our stores with transaction comps that were positive to now almost a quarter of our system with positive transaction comps.\nI know we're making progress just by seeing how we are improving our transaction comps as it relates to our existing store base. The nice thing is that obviously translates into what percent of stores are delivering sales comp, right? Now we're closing in on 42% of the system with positive sales comp. The thing that's really exciting too is the morning; we're almost right around 50% of our stores with positive sales comp.\nAgain, we're making great progress both across the system with the Back to Starbucks programs just on getting back to being focused on the customer, simplifying the operation for our partner, and then being very crystal clear on what are the things that we need to be spending our time on. That is all around providing a great coffeehouse experience. I think we're starting to see it in the results.\nThen obviously, as I mentioned earlier in the pilot. The innovation that you talk about, you guys are going to chuckle about this a little bit, but we're using the stage gate process, right, to make sure that what we bring in truly does provide meaningful innovation, whether it's food, whether it's drinks, or whether it's an afternoon targeted program. I think it's just really smart of us to know how does it impact the business and how does it ultimately perform with the customer and how is it able to be executed consistently with our partners. I'm really excited about the pipeline that we're building. To be frank, the pipeline was a little thin, and we're building it back.\nI think at the same token, the team's doing a nice job of taking advantage of what news we do have to make it as big and as impactful as possible without getting in the way of what we want to accomplish in the store with the Back to Starbucks program. I think you'll see that even coming up in the summer months as we start to roll out some new news.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nEquity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Brian, you talked about building a globally resilient business. With investor concerns surrounding a recessionary macro and Starbucks's underperformance in past periods of economic deterioration, what levers does the brand have at its disposal to protect US traffic if the macro deteriorates further? You maybe said differently, what parts of the Back to Starbucks playbook can you accelerate if the macro becomes more challenging in the US?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks for the question. Look, here's what I would tell you is the one thing that we've heard consistently over and over again is getting back to this idea of the Third Place and the connection and doing it in a way where we're on time with the mobile order and accurate. We're less than four minutes in the café, less than four minutes in the drive-through, and then with a great seat is a real point of difference.\nIt is one of those things that people would say, \"Hey, look, this is a simple everyday luxury that I can still continue to participate in kind of regardless of what some of the economic challenges are around them,\" is what some of the feedback we're getting. Now, if it's a major step backwards in a macro environment, of course, we'll be impacted. My experience has been the best way to go after these things is with your best offense.\nOur best offense is to make a great Third Place with a great drink, with a great barista, providing that connection. In the innovation pipeline, we've got some news that I think would cut through in any environment. Some of those things you can go a little bit faster on because it doesn't require additional equipment or anything. We'll recognize what's happening with the customer, and we'll adjust accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much. I think, Brian, you mentioned the under 15-minute goal on the mobile order delivery in the last call. I think you've started to test the mobile order sequencing algo as well in a few of your stores. Any early thoughts here on how you sized the opportunity? Can you walk us through how the partner and customer experience would change with that? Thank you so much.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah. That is a pilot that we've gone from three stores to now we're in over 400 stores. What I'm happy to report on is really what we're trying to do is figure out how we could continue to be on time with mobile orders while providing better speed of service and customer connection for the drive-through, the in-café, and then obviously the handoff as it relates to the mobile order. The pilot has been proving just that.\nWe've, I think, pulled out over two minutes in the in-store time. We've definitely seen the drive-through exceed the four-minute goal, which is great. We're averaging less than four minutes in the drive-through. We pulled out about two and a half minutes in the café. We've got about 75% of the stores that are in the pilot now achieving what I would call the 4-4-12 metrics without having anybody be dissatisfied with the time of their mobile order experience.\nAll really good stuff happening for the customer as it relates to the partner. The good news is a lot of this just happens behind the scenes for the partner. Because what happens is behind the scenes, the technology is figuring out how to route which order to the store and to the certain station, so that when they pull out the ticket, it has already done the work, so that they're pulling the ticket as the right drink for them to make, so that they will be successful hitting those speed times, and then enables the partner to have the time to have the connection with our customers as well.\nOne of the things that really is fun to see in these stores is it's just a lot calmer. People move with purpose, but it's a lot calmer. There's the opportunity to provide great connection. That's really what we want the technology to do behind the scenes is just be that behind the scenes so that our partners are set up for success to connect and do their craft with our customers on every transaction.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to say hello to Cathy and throw a question your way. You mentioned ROIC and returning to strength. This was not normally a metric highlighted on Starbucks calls. Perhaps it got more attention in your prior roles. I'm just wondering if you can share, in your first month, how you think about the ROIC framework at Starbucks and maybe how it might come into play as you make decisions going forward. Thank you.\n\nCathy Smith\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I look forward to meeting you soon. Yeah. For a very, very long time, I believe at the end of the day, our shareholders want really two things: give me durable, sustainable growth and give me a good return on invested capital for the risk I'm willing to take for that growth. It's very, very simple to me. If we focus on those two metrics, I think we'll get to good outcomes for all of us and for our shareholders. That said, to your point, I think we've got a little bit of work, as Brian shared with the portfolio. While they still give us great IRRs by most standards, not by our standards. We've historically done better, and I think we can do better, and we will. We'll think about that.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nAll the while, though, we're going to make sure we invest in the Back to Starbucks strategy, and then we'll find our offsets. I love deploying a few tools like zero-based budgeting, which will come into our vernacular this next year, which will help us get after some of those maybe stranded costs. All of that, though, in service of durable growth and a good Return on Invested Capital.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question. Jon Tower?\n\nJon Tower\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nSorry about that. I got to figure out how to use the mute button. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe following up to the labor pilot comment that you'd spoke about earlier, I think you said 1,500 stores and 3,000 stores by the end of fiscal 2025. Do you see that being deployed across the whole US store base over time, or is it more a select number of stores? Then maybe on top of that, do you see any sort of incentive changing for store-level labor, maybe at the GM level or at the hourly level? Or do you feel pretty good about where that sits today?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Look, I do. Well, first, thanks for the question. I do see us rolling this across all of our US company stores. It'll be in different forms, right, because we have some stores that are café and very urban. We have some stores that are drive-through, mobile, café that are more suburban. What it ultimately looks like as far as being deployed in the store will be contingent upon the business that they run. I'll just give you an example.\nI was just in Chicago last week, and they have the labor pilot in their stores. The one store is a downtown Chicago store doing a lot of transactions, big mobile business, nice café business. Not surprising, we added a lot of labor against the mobile order side of the business. For perspective, this store is doing like 250 transactions in 30 minutes. The woman that runs it is Alicia, a fabulous leader. The place is just running like super smooth, no form of chaos. The customers that want to have an in-café experience have a great in-café experience. Customers that want to just grab and go have a great grab-and-go experience. In that place, she increased a lot of the labor towards the peak and then also some of the shoulder hours, and primarily in the mobile ordering space.\nThen the algorithm is going to, behind the scenes, help us manage how those orders flow. Versus, like, a suburban store, one of the things we saw with putting in this additional labor is we committed a person to just be stationed at the drive-through. In this case, the woman's name was Jessica. That was the store manager of this store. She's done a fabulous job of taking the labor that we're generating as a result of the peak pickup into our weekend business.\nI just give this as examples of it's going to be we're going to need to move both the labor and the deployment to match what the business actually flow looks like. What's great to see is in both of those scenarios, which are two very different stores, you're seeing transaction growth.\nYou're seeing a team that's highly engaged, highly energized, I think moving with simplicity, moving with connection, and then also just moving to our customer, which is really exciting. The plan is we will be moving this Green Apron Service Model across all our stores in the US. It'll be a rollout that's very focused. We'll make sure that our managers and our district managers and the whole leadership is dialed into what we are after with this Green Apron Service Model andd the early signs are very promising.\n\nJohn Ivanko\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from John Ivanko with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nHi. Thank you. The question is on the drive-through. Really in the context of that, the Siren station, particularly around the ice machine and food warming cabinets, at least from my understanding, were really geared at least partially to significantly improving speed of service at the drive-through, especially where you had a very high blended mix or you had a high food mix. Really, I'm going to go two parts with this question is do you think those components of Siren might make sense in the future, or are you just suspending them for now?\nThe second part of the question, and you've alluded to afternoon a couple of times, does it make sense for Starbucks to actually split its menu to some extent of products that are available in the morning and other products that maybe are a little bit more time-intensive or customized that would only be available in the afternoon? Thank you. Yeah.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nTo answer your first question, obviously, there are some stores, to your point, that would warrant putting in the Siren System when they've got a very high mix of drive-through and a very high level of transactions. It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren System. It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores. It's going to be very targeted, and it's going to be on a very, I would say, use basis as it relates to the store has a need. Then in that case, we will implement it. For the bulk of our stores, the majority of our stores, it's just not the necessary solution. We have plenty of capacity if we deploy, use the technology, and execute with excellence the way I know we can.\nTo your other question about how you think about the menu, look, that's kind of what I'm alluding to is when we do things like an aperitivo menu, right, that would be available in the afternoon from, say, 2:00PM-5:00PM. We definitely want to reinforce the artisanal, the craft aspect that we provide for when people want to have that little snack or that little pick-me-up drink in the afternoon. It gives us some flexibility to do some different things in the afternoon that maybe we wouldn't be able to do in the morning. Digital Menu Boards will help enable that, the way we can market it, and then, frankly, just being clear in how we market the actual menu and what the experience is will help with that.\nYeah, we want to take advantage of what our capabilities are and the fact that we're open from 5:00AM, 6:00AM in the morning until 7:00PM, 8:00PM, 9:00PM at night. We got to be smart about delivering on beverages and food for the occasions that move throughout the day.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please state your question.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nThanks. Brian, on the last call, you mentioned several near-term changes that could be implemented in China to stabilize business. They appear to be working, but can you describe some of those changes and whether you believe they have stabilized the transaction declines?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question on China. Molly and the team have done a really nice job of getting after some key things that we need to do to be more competitive in the market. They've started to implement, I think, some very relevant marketing. They've also brought forward some very relevant product innovation, both in flavors and now most recently in this sugar and flavor separation program, and then also the dumpling program that they have.\nThey've already started the process of figuring out products at certain prices combined with, I think, very relevant innovation and some additional marketing that's connecting in a very culturally relevant way. The good news is Molly and the team are just getting started. A lot of their ideas still are yet to roll out, but the things that they've rolled out most recently have definitely made a very nice impact. The flat comp with four points of transaction growth is really nice to see. I think the team is going to build on the momentum that we're starting to create in the China market.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please state your question.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. Brian, this question is on pricing. Earlier, you were mentioning that you had intention of not increasing prices in 2025. Arguably, with general inflation rising given the tariffs, you might have a golden opportunity to be pricing below competitors and perhaps strengthen the value positioning of Starbucks. At the same time, the coffee prices are increasing. Are you planning to maintain prices in 2026 as well, or will you be prioritizing margin protection? Also, can you help us quantify the impact of rising coffee prices on margin? Thank you. Yeah.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nI think, as I've stated before, our intention is to not move on pricing for the balance of this fiscal year. We've also done some other things, I think, to enhance the value proposition, like not charging for all dairy. You're going to be seeing us on the pricing front also roll out in the app here in the next couple of months, easier ways for people to navigate and get pricing transparency into their transaction, which I think is also going to help clarify things for our customers. Then, look, as it relates to 2026, we're going to be working on a lot of things to figure out how we can improve margin. I think it'd be premature to say we got to use price as the only way to protect margin.\nI think we're going to be looking at ways to grow the business and also take really a hard look through the zero-based budgeting approach to understand where else there might be some offsets. Frankly, price would be the last lever I'd like to pull. We'll assess as we get closer to 2026 and then do what we believe is the right thing for both the customer, the business, and the brand.\nI think your last question was in regard to coffee prices as it relates to the business. The good news for us is it's actually a small piece of the total cost of sales proposition. The team does a great job of buying coffee. I think you've seen historically how they've done a really nice job on that. They're currently doing a really nice job on that as well. Cathy, I don't know if you wanted to add any more details.\n\nCathy Smith\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nNo, just that it's typically 10% to 15% of our product and distribution costs. As Brian said, it's small. Maybe the only other thing to layer on is our team has historically for a very long time had a great sourcing, hedging, and warehousing program that then will mute the prices both on the upside when prices are rising and when they're coming back down. All of that said, I think the bigger picture is where Brian went, which is a smaller piece of our total product and distribution costs.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, since the Fall of 2024, Starbucks has embarked on pretty meaningful change, an investment behind advertising, a lot of linear TV behind sporting events, some radio. Can you just talk a little bit about the return on that investment that you're seeing, how you're measuring that? Should we continue to expect that this will be the cadence going forward? You'll continue to invest behind linear TV and radio and maybe even increase that going forward? Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks. Yeah. Look, we're feeling really good about how the marketing is taking hold. One of the brand trackers that we do, we just got back that brand first choice is the highest Starbucks has been since 2023. The other thing that also I'm really delighted to see is the progress that we're making with our non-Rewards customers from a transaction standpoint.\nWe were at a really big deficit in kind of that fall when I first got here. Literally, every quarter, it has improved from a transaction basis. Even as we enter Q3, I'm continuing to see further improvement. The other thing that's really nice to see is as we've removed a lot of the discounting, we've seen higher quality transactions show up.\nIt's showing up in ticket a little bit to the tune of like a point, roughly. What I'm most excited about is when you talk to customers, they're giving us feedback that I'm really getting a better experience from Starbucks. It's interesting. It's just little things like the barista asking me, \"Do I want to stay, or is this to go?\", writing the little note on the cup, having that connection at handoff, and having the condiment bar back.\nI think bringing these things to life in advertising and then having it be reinforced when you're in store is one of those cycles that just build on it. Look, I think trusting the team we're doing a great job. I would say it's beyond just the linear TV. It's the social. It's the digital. It's all the different aspects of how we communicate with customers. I think we're going to continue to just get better from here as it relates to the marketing side of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol for closing remarks.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nAll right. Well, thank you for your time and all the questions. Obviously, I'd be remiss if I don't first just mention the hard fact in front of us, which is our Q2 2025 financial results were disappointing. I think the thing I want you to know is behind the scenes, we really are showing a lot of signs of progress. I think, as I've said before, our turnaround is going to take a little bit of time. We've got much more work to do as we build back a better business.\nI can't emphasize enough, it's not just about building back the business. It's about building back a better business. I'm more confident, frankly, than ever about the opportunities ahead of us. Frankly, I think there's more opportunity than I even imagined when I first came into the job. I've learned a lot over the last seven months.\nWe've got a great team that is in place that is committed to winning with customers and doing it in a way where we set our partners up for success. I think I've said this before. I've led turnarounds like this before. I really do have a lot of confidence as we continue to scale the work underway and we manage costs smartly. Our Starbucks transformation that we're going to lead, I think it's going to be both impactful and enduring. Our aim is just that. We want to build a Starbucks with a clear mission and purpose, need to be loved for its coffee, its warm and welcoming coffee houses, and our talented Green Apron Partners in the community that we build.\nWe're focused, I can't emphasize enough, we're focused on moving quickly, but we're also focused on executing with excellence so that we can deliver on all these commitments. Look, in doing so, I'm confident we're going to stabilize the business. I think we're starting to show that right now in our results. Then we're going to build resilience so that we, frankly, create economic opportunity for both our partners.\nThen, obviously, we want to provide an exceptional experience for our customers. Then we want to clearly generate terrific long-term returns for our shareholders. Lastly, I just want to say thank you to our partners for supporting the changes that we're making and for the feedback that they continue to provide. I can't emphasize enough how much they are the leading edge of our comeback. I hope that all of our partners are really proud of the work that we're doing, and they're proud to continue to wear the Green Apron. With that, have a great afternoon, and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Starbucks' Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call. You may now disconnect."

Also, for your calendar planning purposes, please note that our second quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, 29th April 2025. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining today. Over the past four months, we've been focused on getting back to Starbucks and those things that have always set us apart: a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas. We believe it's the fundamental change in strategy we need to solve our underlying issues, restore confidence in our brand, and return the business to sustainable long-term growth. While we're only one quarter into our turnaround, we're moving quickly to act on the Back-to-Starbucks efforts we outlined on our last call. And to date, we've seen a positive response.\nAs Rachel will outline in greater detail, our financial performance met our expectations for the quarter, with a total company revenue of $9.4 billion, a global comparable store sales decline of 4%, a global operating margin of 11.9%, and overall earnings per share of $0.69. To be clear, these results have room for improvement, but I'm confident the disciplined investments we're making in labor, marketing, technology, and stores this fiscal year will help stabilize the business and position Starbucks for future growth. We're also working to change the role, structure, and size of our support teams to improve efficiency and accountability. This will ensure we deliver on our commitments and our work to get back to Starbucks. Let me share with you some of the progress we've made through the quarter and what we're focusing on next. Our path back to Starbucks in the U.S.\nis driven by four core initiatives: reintroduce Starbucks to the world, deliver the customer experience to win the morning, reestablish Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensure Starbucks is the unrivaled best job in retail, recognizing our success starts and ends with our Green Apron partners. During the quarter, we moved quickly to refocus the business, our mission, and our marketing to align with our core identity as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world. We started by reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers, resulting in 40% fewer discounted transactions year over year. We also removed the extra charge for non-dairy milk customizations and identified several other steps we can take to make our pricing architecture more transparent for customers. Just this week, we launched a new Coffee Forward U.S. marketing campaign, reintroducing the brand to a broader customer audience.\nOur work to reintroduce our brand is just beginning, but our core business is already strengthening, demonstrating that when we talk about our business, customers respond. Through the quarter, we saw a shift in our sales mix towards coffee and espresso-based beverages, which overdelivered and compensated for lower-than-expected performance across our holiday promotions. We've been focused on simplifying our menu to position partners for success, improve consistency, drive customer satisfaction, and enhance our economics. As part of this work, we made some late simplifications to our holiday product lineup and believe we have more opportunity ahead as we follow a disciplined stage-gate process to innovate and bring to market fewer, better beverage and food offerings that reflect our premium positioning.\nIn the coming months, you'll see us begin to optimize our menu offerings, resulting in a roughly 30% reduction in both beverages, and food SKUs by the end of fiscal year 2025. As we do, we'll work to lead this market with breakthrough beverage and food innovation. We'll do this by being responsive to customer trends and their changing preferences. We'll rely on our highly engaged Green Apron partners for inspiration, like we did with our lavender lineup last year, and we'll be more responsive and tuned into cultural moments, like we did with the Dubai Chocolate. We also saw continued improvement in comp trends driven by Back-to-Starbucks efforts launched during Q1. Non-Starbucks Rewards customer traffic grew quarter over quarter. Starbucks Rewards membership and spend grew both quarter over quarter and year over year. Price parity for non-dairy milk customizations brought back lapsed Starbucks Rewards members. Our U.S.\ncategory share among QSRs also recovered in Q1, following two quarters of decline. These things tell us our actions are resonating with customers. Progress like this shows me that the Starbucks brand is still resilient and strong and that we have significant future potential. More importantly, it shows that we can sell more of our core beverages simply by demonstrating our premium value. A key part of the premium value we provide is quickly and consistently delivering a high-quality, handcrafted beverage to customers. The handoff from our barista to the customer is our brand moment of truth, and we've been working hard to get that moment right. Through the quarter, we've continued to test and learn as we position the business to achieve our four-minute throughput goal with a moment of connection. It's become clear through our pilot work that order sequencing creates more of a bottleneck than capacity.\nIn short, investments in staffing and deployment, processes, and algorithm technology demonstrate the greatest opportunity to deliver a four-minute wait time in most of our cafes. As a result, we've started to segment stores by transaction volume and are now targeting installation of Siren equipment only in our highest quartile stores where it is needed to meet our throughput expectations. We've also invested additional coverage hours across more than 3,000 U.S. company-operated stores through precision scheduling, introduced new brewed coffee and tea routines, and simplified beverage builds. And soon, we'll launch a pilot across 700 stores looking at staffing levels to improve our Green Apron partners' ability to serve the world's finest coffee with a moment of connection. We'll use learnings from this to inform the future investments we need to make in store coverage hours to deliver both an exceptional partner and customer experience and further differentiate our brand.\nLooking forward, we're beginning to pilot a new in-store prioritization algorithm and are exploring other technology investments to improve order sequencing and our efficiency behind the counter. We're also progressing efforts that build on the strength and popularity of the Starbucks app. This includes development of a capacity-based time slot model that allows customers to schedule mobile orders and a mid-year update that will simplify customization options, improve upfront pricing, and provide real-time price changes as customers customize beverages. Lastly, we're planning to fully deploy digital menu boards in cafes across our U.S. company-owned stores over the next 18 months to make our offerings more easily understood and to better show customization add-ons. We also made strides to reestablish Starbucks as the community coffeehouse. To make it easier for our customers to enjoy a cup of coffee their way, condiment bars will be back in all our U.S.\ncompany-owned stores by the end of the week. We reintroduced ceramic mugs and handwritten notes on cups to better connect with customers and elevate the cafe experience for those who choose to stay and work. We rolled out new cafe service standards and expanded free refills on hot and iced brewed coffee and tea to non-Starbucks Rewards customers at participating stores. We announced a new Coffeehouse Code of Conduct to prioritize our spaces for customers, and we continue to target a full rollout of Clover Vertica brewers by the end of fiscal year 2025. We're taking a hard look at our store portfolio as well. In the U.S. alone, we still see the potential to double our store count while improving the overall health of our portfolio. We'll do this through a strong store renovation program, new store builds, and store closures.\nWe're going to make sure our stores are warm and welcoming, with work continuing on store design standards and cost to build. Early customer and partner reactions to our plans show we've got the right strategy. Both the reintroduction of coffee condiment bars and the expansion of free refills were identified as top drivers of purchase intent. In the coming months, our teams will be focused on refreshing our menu boards and improving cafe merchandising to reflect the coffeehouse feel and better showcase our simplified menu. We'll start an expanded test of risers and shelves at the point of handoff to help separate the cafe and mobile experience, and we'll begin to scale projects to increase and diversify seating across more of our cafes. To deliver a great customer experience, we also have to deliver a great partner experience.\nIt's why everything we do starts and ends with our Green Apron partners and why I'm committed to ensuring Starbucks is the unrivaled best job in retail. In the past quarter, we more than doubled paid parental leave for eligible U.S. store partners, and we made a new commitment to promote from within 90% of retail leadership roles over the next three years, helping thousands of partners grow their careers and their incomes. As a result, through the quarter, shift completion, average hours per partner, partner retention, and hourly partner engagement improved. Looking forward, we'll continue to prioritize efforts that help our Green Apron partners succeed both at work through continued improvements to our staffing model and in their lives through industry-leading benefits, competitive pay, and careers that create lasting economic opportunity.\nTurning to international, I've had a chance to see our operations in Italy, Japan, and South Korea and meet with our international licensed business partners over the past few months. As I shared with them, many of our international markets set an example for the experience we aim to deliver in the U.S. and present a great long-term opportunity, particularly as we continue to grow our store footprint and recover our business in certain challenge markets. Just last week, I also made my first market visit to China. While there, I saw firsthand the strength of our brand, our team, and the premium customer experience we offer. I saw how dynamic the market is and the opportunities ahead. I also saw several near-term changes we can make to stabilize and strengthen our business while continuing to explore strategic partnerships to grow in China.\nWe're processing these learnings, and we will share more as we do. From my time there, I also believe there are several lessons we can learn from the strength of our supply chain in China to realize opportunities in our North American business. If you take one thing from today's call, let it be this: despite near-term challenges, we have significant strengths and a clear plan. The response we've seen since fundamentally shifting our strategy to get back to Starbucks gives us confidence we're on the track to turn the business around. We are where we want to be one quarter in, but much of our work is just beginning. As we continue to learn and implement our Back-to-Starbucks plan, I believe we'll make it easier to be a customer, and in turn, I believe they'll visit more often.\nWe'll also find more ways to set our partners up for success so they're able to deliver a great customer experience every time. In doing so, we'll reinvigorate our brand, drive stronger financial returns, and return Starbucks to growth. There is important work ahead, and I look forward to bringing you along. With that, I'll turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. As Brian shared, we're pleased with our start to fiscal year 2025, with our Q1 performance meeting our expectations. Our back-to-Starbucks Corporation strategy has already driven early progress, including gradual top-line improvement, giving us confidence that we're focused on the right priorities. Our Q1 consolidated revenue was $9.4 billion, flat to the prior year, reflecting 7% net new company-operated store growth over the past 12 months, offset by a 4% decline in comparable store sales.\nOur global comparable store sales decline was primarily due to a 4% decline in the U.S., U.S. comparable store sales improved sequentially throughout the quarter, most evident in the morning day part as non-Starbucks Rewards customers grew from our strategic shift to broader marketing. Our ticket growth in the U.S. remained strong at 4% due to the benefits from the prior year pricing actions and fewer discounts. These drivers more than offset mix shift into lower-priced beverages, and removal of the extra charge for non-dairy milk customizations. Turning to store growth, we opened 377 net new stores globally in Q1, and in the U.S., our new company-operated stores contributed nearly 90% revenue incrementality to the trade areas. As we continue to evaluate our stores globally, we will make disciplined decisions to further strengthen and grow our portfolio, reestablishing ourselves as the community coffeehouse as we drive sustainable long-term growth.\nShifting to margin, our Q1 consolidated operating margin was 11.9%, contracting 380 bps from the prior year, primarily driven by deleverage and the investments in support of Back-to-Starbucks, including store partner wages, benefits, and hours, and the removal of the extra charge for non-dairy milk customizations. The contraction was partially offset by annualization of pricing, and out-of-store efficiencies, largely within our supply chain. Given the Q1 margin contraction, I want to provide additional insight into the investments as well as the offsetting efficiencies. Let me start with investments, a critical initial step to the Back-to-Starbucks turnaround. As Brian shared, to deliver our customer experience to win the morning, we invested additional coverage hours to support the service model of a four-minute wait time and enabling our hospitality point of difference, moments of connection.\nThese additional hours, coupled with wage and benefit rate increases, resulted in a 180 bp margin pressure in the North America segment, excluding labor productivity. As we focus on delivering the customer experience, we continue to evaluate labor needs across our store portfolio as we surgically optimize staffing levels. As you likely saw, we dialed up our marketing communication, including linear TV media, as part of our priority to reintroduce Starbucks to the world. We were pleased with the positive customer reactions, and improvement in our comp trend. Overall promotional spend, which is inclusive of marketing spend, and discounts, remains largely neutral relative to prior year. To improve value perception, we also removed the extra charge for non-dairy milk customizations, an impact of 60 bps on the segment's margin in the quarter.\nFollowing this announcement, we saw strong increases in customer interactions with our brand, as Brian shared previously. Additionally, non-dairy customizations grew mid-single digits year over year off a double-digit decline in the prior year. Collectively, these targeted investments are showing signs of early progress. While there is a near-term impact on margin, we expect that through our disciplined approach to test and learn, we will make the right investments to drive long-term growth. Importantly, we also continue focusing on driving efficiencies across the company as we balance our investments while driving margin expansion over time. In Q1, our in-store efficiencies increased as a result of improved partner stability as we focus on the Back-to-Starbucks strategy. Out-of-store, we further optimized our supply chain and recalibrated rates, resulting in meaningful sourcing efficiencies in the quarter. Collectively, in- and out-of-store efficiencies yield savings of approximately 150 bps in Q1.\nWe will continue to secure additional efficiencies to help fund investments as we leverage a disciplined and data-driven approach to our turnaround. Shifting from efficiencies to G&A. For fiscal year 2025, we expect our G&A percentage to be higher than prior year as we lap lower performance-based compensation. Specific to Q2, we expect G&A as a percentage of revenue to spike as we transform the support organization, incurring near-term restructuring charges inclusive of severance pay and related benefits. At this time, we're still working through the impact of this transformation work, and we'll share more details regarding the financial impact during our Q2 earnings call. Q1 EPS was $0.69, down 22% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of deleverage and heightened investments.\nQ1 EPS also included a $0.02 year-over-year benefit from a lower effective tax rate, primarily driven by a discrete item which is not expected in the balance of this fiscal year. Now, looking at our full fiscal year 2025, although our guidance is suspended, I'd like to provide some insights into our quarterly earnings shape. EPS is expected to be the lowest in Q2 on an absolute basis due to seasonality, the organizational restructuring I just spoke about, and elevated investments, with year-over-year pressure also intensifying in the quarter. EPS is then expected to improve in the latter half of the fiscal year 2025, both sequentially and year-over-year. Some additional aspects to consider as you think about our full year 2025 include the coffee landscape and our channel development segment.\nIn regards to the coffee landscape and the trajectory of C price, given our overall practices and hedging strategy, our year-over-year coffee price impact was minimal in Q1. We currently estimate Q2 EPS to be pressured by approximately $0.01 net of hedge gains. As a reminder, our total cost of green coffee is typically limited to 10% to 15% of our product and distribution costs. In addition to the direct coffee pressure on EPS I just mentioned, C price volatility also impacts our channel development segment and in a more meaningful way. Although we can pass this cost to our business partners, higher prices to an already pressured consumer will likely impact our segment volumes and ultimate revenue and profitability. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, and we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating.\nWe continue to prioritize shareholder value through dividends, providing a predictable return of capital while we turn around our business. In closing, we are encouraged by our Q1 results, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our Back-to-Starbucks strategy. Although we are in the beginning chapter and have much more work ahead of us, my thanks goes to our incredible partners across the globe who are unwavering in their commitment to bring our strategy to life. And with that, Brian and I are happy to take your questions. Thank you. Operator.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows.\nYour first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHi, good evening. My question, Brian, is on the sales improvement you saw through the quarter. I believe Rachel mentioned that comps improved as the quarter progressed. I guess, can you maybe talk about whether that was comparison-related, or do you think you're seeing some underlying structural improvement? And if you're seeing some structural improvement, what do you think is driving that in terms of kind of the key components of your plan? Is it whether it be advertising or store operations? Maybe you can frame that up for us. Thanks.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. And yes, as Rachel said, the good news is we did see kind of sequential improvement throughout the quarter. And I think I mentioned this in some of my remarks.\nThe thing that was nice to see is as we stepped away from discounting and went into more broad-based marketing efforts to demonstrate the craft of our coffee, as well as the experience or the premium experience you get from Starbucks, we saw non-rewards customers respond with more traffic and more transactions, which was really nice to see how that progressed kind of quarter-to-quarter. The other thing, too, that was nice to see is we saw our morning day part continue to show improvements quarter-to-quarter as well. And so I think it's a combination of shifting the approach as far as reaching both rewards and non-rewards customers with, I think, a compelling message around the craft and the quality of our coffee and our experience.\nAnd then also, I think our partners in the stores are really embracing getting back to Starbucks and enjoying making the espresso drinks and providing people that craft experience. And as you've seen, even most recently, the new Back-to-Starbucks rollout that we've got in progress. I was in some stores even this morning, and the energy is really exciting to see both from our partners and our customers. Our customers are feeling the enhanced experience coming from our partners. So definitely baby steps in both of these areas, but all moving in the right direction.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your question.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Brian, can you talk a little bit more about Tressie Lieberman's plan of attack to help build on the initial marketing work around reintroducing the brand?\nAnd curious, last year was disclosed about $600 million of advertising spend. What level can we think about for 2025? If you can comment on that as well.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, what we're definitely doing right now is switching the dollars out of discounting into what I would call working dollars for the brands and the brand experience. And so what you're going to continue to see is you might have saw we just broke a new ad over the weekend highlighting, I think, a key point of difference for Starbucks, which is centered on this connection that our baristas and our Green Apron partners have with our customers. And one of the ways that comes through is writing on cups.\nWhat I love about this is, look, we're taking these dollars, allocating it to talk about the brand experience, and it's in such a way where it's very executable for people to actually experience it through our partners in the stores. You're going to continue to see us use these dollars to turn it into working dollars to drive towards a brand commitment, but then also an experience commitment where hopefully every time you come into a Starbucks, not only do you get your coffee or your drink, but you also get this connection. That's what we're going to continue to do. I think we're still finalizing exactly what does that spend look like ongoing. I like the transition that we've made, and I'm optimistic about the campaign that we've just started because there's a lot of additional elements still to come.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThe way to think about it, too, from marketing as a percentage of revenue, we are increasing it. You could say close to doubling it, but we've reduced the discount. So we've increased overall net revenue while we're putting it towards, as Brian said, the working dollars in marketing. So it's neutral to the business overall, but you will see a shift in terms of how it shows up in the P&L and in the business.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please state your question.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Thank you for the question. Brian, I was wondering if you can help us quantify the impact of the operational improvements that you're starting to see at Starbucks.\nMaybe specifically, if you can help us understand maybe what percentage of the stores are operating in line with the four-minute handover timeline that you are expecting from the stores, and what kind of comp differential do you see between the stores that are operating at the level of efficiency that you are expecting versus the ones that need some incremental time to transform? Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. So what we've done so far is we've definitely put the stores into kind of core tiles as it relates to how many transactions they're working through. And through this work, what we've discovered is more of the challenge comes through, frankly, the mobile ordering system not having a sequencing system.\nAnd what happens is that counter area gets really crowded, congested, and what occurs for our partners is the work switches to the task of just trying to get drinks and food solved for the rush as opposed to being able to consistently deliver the moment of connection while they still deliver the coffee drinks. And so the good news is we have a high percentage of stores that are already comping positively. And when we look at those stores, we see that the connection and the craft is being executed, and we're not in as many of these bottleneck situations. And so that's what we're focused on is how do we eliminate these bottleneck situations where the mobile ordering really overwhelms kind of the production experience to the point where we can no longer provide a great service experience. And so we've seen the difference in performance.\nWe've seen the difference in, and that's from a comp and financial performance. And we've also seen the difference in partner satisfaction, customer satisfaction. So we're working through exactly how we measure these things because, unfortunately, currently, we don't have a great system in place to measure the timeframe on these things, which we are putting into place. But as I mentioned earlier, the good news is I was in one of our stores this morning where we've already started to put this algorithm in that happens kind of behind the scenes, and it smooths out, I would say, those rushes of mobile orders such that our teams are able to provide great moments of connection for the in-cafe customer and the mobile order customer, as well as our drive-thru customer.\nAnd now we're only two weeks in on this, by the way, and it's only in three stores, but we're seeing really good performance both in the financial performance, partner satisfaction, and customer satisfaction.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question. Sara Senatore, please unmute yourself. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. Wanted to ask you a question about productivity. There was a previous belief that there might be a $4 billion productivity opportunity over the four years ending 2028. Obviously, that's a big number. It could be 250 bps to 300 bps of margin help before considering other investments. And that was going to be largely COGS-driven.\nDo you still see, does Starbucks still see that sort of opportunity before considering investments that you might be making in the business?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nDavid, this is Rachel. Thanks for the question. What I'd say is we're continuing to be focused on efficiencies, and we see continued opportunity both in our store as well as out of store, which is largely, as you pointed out, COGS or through our supply chain. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, we had collectively about 150 bps of margin expansion this quarter due to the efficiency. So we continue to believe that's an important part of how we think about our Back-to-Starbucks strategy, helping us to balance the investments we'll be making and eventually leading to margin expansion over time.\nBut I think as far as it relates to the four billion, we're still working through what's going to be the right level of efficiencies for us as we go forward. And so I wouldn't stick to the four billion. I would just say that we will continue efficiency work as we think about how we drive margin expansion in the future.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on some of the announcements you made about the support organization, you've also made some management changes. What needs to change there, I guess? How much do you expect that to change? And sort of related to that, Rachel, I understand the comments on G&A in Q2.\nIs this something where you might expect some favorability as we get into Q3, Q4, and you sort of start to see those changes take hold?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nFirst of all, I would say the purpose of the changes is to get more accountability into our key lines of business. So you saw we're creating the role of a chief store officer. Mike's responsibility is going to be all about driving excellence in our stores, putting a chief development officer in place, again, ensuring we're building the right sites with the right design at the right cost, and return, which is having a clear line of sight.\nSo similar to what we're trying to do for driving that accountability through our stores, which is really where the business happens, we want to make sure that we've got the support center also focused on supporting the stores in an efficient manner and an accountable manner to where the business happens. So structurally, that's what's going on. And we're in the process of evolving that over the next couple of months. The second half of that, I'll let Rachel chime in on that piece.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nSo Brian, in terms of your question about the G&A and the impact, as we think about the full year, we would expect, while we'll have the spike in Q2, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we would expect to start to see some savings in Q4 related to that particular effort.\nBut I think what's important to remember is that we're also lapping lower performance-based comp this year, and that starts to take an even greater impact in Q3 and Q4. So net-net G&A this year will still be higher than prior year as a percentage of revenue, largely given that lap of lower-based performance comp from last year. But yes, you would expect just from the restructuring itself, you would see some benefit in Q4. And then, of course, we will expect this will drive leverage over time.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please state your question.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThanks. Brian, as we've thought about the business, our view has been that improving the partner experience is somewhat intertwined with improving the customer experience. Are there specific customer experience issues you believe the company can resolve that should also help improve the employee experience?\nAnd sort of related to this, when do you expect that the mobile ordering algorithm changes to be implemented?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, I think you're absolutely right. The idea of setting up our partners to be successful in every customer interaction results in, I think, great experiences for our customers. And they are highly intertwined. And I actually believe that's why it's so important that we have got kind of that great greeting moment and that great handoff moment. And what I'm seeing in the kind of early days of this small pilot is just that, where two things are happening. One, the partners are set up to deliver these craft drinks with a great kind of human touch or connection at the speed that makes our customers feel really great about getting their drink or their total order.\nSo they're kind of working in tandem because what the algorithm does is it takes the stress out of the system of having the partner have to figure out how to solve these mobile orders that just came in that weren't sequenced. Now what it does is it sequences those mobile orders so that it can allow the cafe order to get fulfilled in a timely fashion and with a touch of humanity. And then the same thing happens with the mobile order because now we're better sequenced up for when people come in to give them their drink. So we're going to continue to expand the pilot. There's some other things we want to test around this, with also adding the idea of time slots, how that compares to just changing promise times.\nSo ideally, over the next couple of months, we're going to get a lot of learning, which then will give us clarity on the right timetable to roll out. But don't have definitive timing just yet.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Brian, I know comps always gone or outsized attention, and justifiably so. But just wanted to talk about unit growth for a moment. I know in the U.S., obviously, the unit growth could be a more consistent driver of top line. And I think you said opportunity to double the store count in the U.S. I believe you were referring, I guess, to the company-operated system, which in the U.S. is already pushing 10,000+. So the doubling, I guess, caught me by surprise.\nThat was above my expectation in terms of the total addressable market. I'm just wondering, as you think about that doubling, what do you think is the rate of growth that's appropriate as you look to achieve that? Maybe how did you arrive at that doubling in other particular geographies or store types that have greater opportunity than others? Just curious how you think about that TAM in the U.S. and that opportunity. Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, one of the things I'm really excited about is our ability to execute a smaller format that still has a great seat, okay, and delivers the partner experience or the engine behind the counter so that we can provide these craft drinks in a timely manner with that personal touch.\nAnd so when you combine our ability to do the drive-thru, the cafe, the mobile ordering in small, medium, large kind of executions, it just starts to open up trade areas that you get really excited about. And we're having tremendous success in places like Texas or the Southeast. And as we continue to open stores in those areas, they open with great economics. And that's what gives us a lot of confidence. Versus there are other markets that, frankly, we have a lot of work to do on just resetting the estate so that we have the right mix of the small, medium, large, and the right mix of the access points. So the good news is the brand has a lot of flexibility in how we execute the experience. And that's what gives us the confidence that we could double the store count.\nAnd then, obviously, we get the sequencing figured out on mobile ordering. I think that just frees us up to another degree that we still haven't totally comprehended, I guess.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from John Ivanko with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.\n\nJohn Ivanko\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThere's been at least some conversation about perhaps limiting the menu in the morning of products that were really some of the high-repeat products that would be focused on speed, accuracy, consistency, and maybe opening up the afternoon to products that were more differentiated and have more customization. So I wanted to get your thought if that was a possibility of maybe having different offerings kind of in the A.M. and the P.M. at Starbucks. And secondly, and I think related to that, food warming cabinets does seem to be one of the \"easiest\" ways to speed up transaction times, specifically in the drive-thru.\nCould you give us an update on that element of Siren specifically in terms of what you might expect there allowed to be?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, that's one of the key pieces of driving our digital menu board execution is that does give us the flexibility to do the merchandising of kind of different food experiences or drink experiences in the afternoon versus the morning. As I mentioned, I think in my prepared remarks, we are dialing back the menu both in food and beverage to the tune of roughly 30% between now and the end of our fiscal year, which then frees us up, frankly, to make sure we've got what I would call the right food offerings in the morning.\nAnd then also we're looking at how do we provide the right kind of snacks/food offerings as you get further into the day. And like I said, the digital menu boards allow us the flexibility then to merchandise accordingly. Regarding the hot hold equipment, what we find is that's a great solution depending on the volume or transactions that we have in the store, regardless of whether there's a drive-thru or not. And so you're right. Obviously, if we had a hot hold when the person just showed up to the order board, it could be much faster. But we find the trade-off in that hot hold versus just cooking it fresh to order at those moments. It's not the right trade-off in investing in that type of equipment and also the experience that you get from it.\nSo right now, it's much more contingent upon the volume thresholds than it is moving speed along kind of for all-day kind of experiences is the way I would describe it.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Katherine Griffin with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nKatherine Griffin\n\nVP, Bank of America\n\nHi. Thanks. Can you hear me?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nYes.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah.\n\nKatherine Griffin\n\nVP, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Okay. This is Katherine on behalf of Sara Senatore. So earlier, I think, Rachel, you were talking about having less promotions as a positive impact on revenue. I think the goal from here is to move towards more of a traffic-driven same-store sales growth model, but we didn't see much of that this quarter. I think you mentioned that promotional transactions were 40% lower year over year. But can you quantify what the impact of that was on ticket? And was that because of fewer promotions?\nAnd then I guess to the extent that you're encouraged by these results, is that what you're looking at? You're looking for more full-priced sales?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nI would start by saying we're looking for a combination. I mean, our rewards customers continue to be incredibly important. But we've seen value as we speak to all of our customers. And as we've shifted out of discounts into more broad-based marketing, that's helped us reach a broader base of customers, which this quarter, even though we're early in the turnaround, we saw good signs of progress. As Brian had shared, we had growth in the morning day part. We had growth across our customer base, but our non-SR customers grew quarter over quarter. And importantly, we saw their growth as high as where we were about a year ago. So that gives us a lot of confidence that it's the right strategy.\nAnd in terms of the impact on ticket, as I had shared in my prepared remarks, our ticket in North America was about 4%, a little over 4%. Within that ticket, that was benefiting from annualized pricing, but it also benefited from fewer discounts. That was partially then offset by the mix shift towards lower-priced items as well as the decision we had made to remove the alt dairy pricing. We see that removal of the discount or shifting of the discount, we're still discounting, but shifting the discount as a way for us to strengthen ticket, but also strengthen the overall proposition as we speak to more customers more broadly.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director, BTIG\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to ask about the Siren System.\nIt sounds like you guys are only going to implement this in the highest quartile stores. Just curious, it sounds like it's a little bit of a difference from what you were initially expecting last quarter. I know it's early, but why don't the other stores, the remaining system, need it? And can they get to the four-minute coffee time without this system? Just curious as to the timing on rolling this Siren System out to the top-performing stores. Thanks.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, you're right. It's a new learning that we've picked up over the last couple of months, specifically as we've gotten very focused on getting the four-minute solution and bringing order to mobile ordering. What has become clear is it's not, in most stores, it is not driven by a lack of capacity.\nIt's more the process combined with the algorithm to sequence the mobile orders with the cafe. So there's a threshold where the volume gets to a place where the additional equipment is necessary. But that's only happening in the top quartile of stores. And in the majority of our stores, just kind of putting the right process, the right deployment combined with the algorithm, we see a big unlock in transaction throughput capability. So that's what we're focused on. And it's a learning we've picked up over the last couple of months. And I think this is what's great about taking the test-and-learn approach, is, as we learn, we adopt. And what we're adopting towards is making sure that we get the best experience for both the partner and our customer.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\nSo Brian, as you come into the coffee business with fresh pair of eyes, I was hoping to get your assessment on the challenges of drawing younger customers back into the stores. Do you still view this as an important strategic focus in your turnaround plans in North America? And if so, why do you think they're more hesitant? Is it premium prices? Is it that they're drinking less coffee in general? Are they attracted to more local coffeehouses? And more importantly, how do these observations inform your menu and marketing strategy going forward? Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, obviously, I think we've talked about this. One of the things we want to do is broaden our reach. So we've said we want to be winning with Gen Z all the way through to the over-50, 60 crowd.\nAnd what we've discovered is - and this is actually a really nice piece of the business - is the younger customer is definitely attracted to the whole tea proposition that we have, the matcha latte solution. You might have seen we most recently brought out the unsweetened matcha. And then that caught a little bit of social media buzz with the Dubai Chocolate. And so we're seeing nice movement actually in all age groups. And it does appear that if we bring smart flavors with tea, Refreshers, cold beverages - that's inclusive of even iced coffee or cold brew - we continue to see progress with the younger customer. So I think it's a much more balanced approach is how I would describe it as opposed to a, \"We're just focused on young and cold drinks.\" That's not what we want to be about.\nWe want to be about being a solution, frankly, for all those that want that third-place experience with a customized handcrafted drink. And the nice thing is we can do that through tea. We can do that through cold. We can do that through coffee. And so we're seeing nice progress on all those fronts.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much. I wanted to ask about the partner investments. You added additional hours to 3,000 stores. You talked about the 700-store pilot. How are you assessing the current level of staffing across the U.S. system and magnitude of investment that might still be necessary? And then to what extent do you see opportunities to offset these investments through other areas as we think through run rate margins, or wholesale leverage be enough? Thank you.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah.\nSo we put in the labor into those 3,000 stores from a precision standpoint, which was really just going back and looking at the labor tables to find out where potentially we just gotten too thin in certain areas. And so we've implemented that. The good news is we've seen a positive response on that front. In regards to the pilot that we've just about to kick off, this is all about understanding the labor model necessary to have a great customer connection for our partners, deliver the speed and handcrafted experience we want. And what we know is if we do all those things, our partners are excited about the job at hand, and our customers love the experience that they receive. And we see that playing out as they'll come more often. And it further differentiates the Starbucks business and the premium value that we provide.\nSo this is all about delivering the brand experience, reinforcing the premium experience that you get, and doing things, frankly, that you really can't get anywhere else. When you get a handcrafted beverage with the personal connection that we provide, it's a huge point of difference. It's meaningful for our partners, and it's meaningful for our customers. And just like recently with bringing back the writing on cups and bags, the feedback I've received from our partners is they love delighting their customers. And what I've heard from our customers is they love getting these little messages and moments of connection from our partners. So this is back to the core of what makes Starbucks a unique experience. That's what we're working towards understanding: what type of model do we need in order to deliver that experience?\nAnd then obviously, we'll figure out how we can grow the business accordingly with that type of investment. As Rachel mentioned, longer term, what we're looking for is to grow margins from where we are today and grow the business from where we are today. The goal of doing all this isn't just to stand still. The goal in doing all this is to put the brand on its front foot, establish the premium value, the premium experience that we provide, and then use that as a launching point to grow the business, both from transactions that then play out into, obviously, the economics.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks",
    "content2": "And if I would just add to that really quickly, Lauren, what I would say is when we think about the labor investments, which we have a precision staffing model we use, so they are targeted.\nWhile there is a near-term impact, there is a near-term unfavorable impact as we make these types of investments. It will be accretive to the business longer term as these investments will drive traffic, to Brian's point. That's why we're doing this. So it wouldn't be in every store. I mean, it's really about what the store needs, and it's based on that precision scheduling. So I think about it as, first and foremost, the way we make this work is through traffic and ensuring that we drive the traffic over the longer term. Then to balance all the investments we're making, while we do expect these investments will be accretive and we'll see broader traffic improvement from these collective investments that we're making, I do think it's important to just remind that we will continue to work on efficiencies as well.\nWe still have opportunities in the business across our business to be able to balance this. All this will lead to margin expansion in the future.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nPartner and Head of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nGood afternoon. I guess as I think about the different channels that you have coming into North America, whether it's walk-in, drive-through, or mobile, what part of the equation is the furthest off from that four-minute total? And as you think about labor deployment, is there a way to kind of disaggregate the production of those channels as they come in to make it kind of more aligned?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Look, thanks for the question. I will tell you, probably right now, the biggest challenge is the fact that the mobile ordering has no sequencing. It's just first in, first out.\nAnd when you compare that to how drive-through works on kind of all the access points, drive-through is a very, I would say, controlled access point, right? You've got the queue that creates a governor. You've got the order board where we actually give a great greeting. And then you get to the window and we give a great handoff. That operates pretty well. We have really good metrics. We know how to get the window times we're after. Obviously, you have the unexpected order that might slow things down, but we can recover quickly. The place where we run into problems, frankly, is the fact that there is just no gating on the mobile orders. And the problem we run into is you've seen this. All these orders come flooding in. Frankly, they come flooding in faster than even our customer can get there.\nSo all these drinks are sitting on the counter, and it's at the expense of providing any other experience for a customer that's right in the store. The thing I was most excited about is this morning, I swung by one of our stores with this pilot, and there was no congestion at the counter. And what was also really nice is the in-cafe customer—I love this term we have around here—they ask for their cup, and they're like—we call it a mug hug, right? They're like holding on to that ceramic mug, and they're enjoying their moment in the cafe. And there's not all this congestion surrounding the counter. So it's just a much more pleasant, peaceful coffee experience. Then, meanwhile, when the mobile order customer comes in, the drinks are synced up in rhythm with people coming in to get their drinks and go.\nAnd so that's what we're after. And that's why I go back to this of, look, we put a lot of things in place, I think, in really short order, right? The coffee condiment bar. The other thing that was great, this was unexpected, but literally one of our customers, she stopped me and was like, \"Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for the coffee condiment bar,\" because she was able to do her own customization and be on her way. And then we changed the operation of getting brewed coffee right at the POS. So it was a really fast transaction for that customer that chose to come into our store, get a brewed cup of coffee, customize it for themselves, and move on. So what we're after is getting rid of that kind of choke point that happens around the counter.\nIt really happens because right now, mobile ordering is just a first in, first out proposition, and we got to fix it. That's what we've got a full court press on, is solving the sequencing of that to deliver these moments of connection in what I would think is a reasonable time period, call it four minutes or less. So I was really excited about what I saw. The good news is we've got a lot of stores that are doing it. Then when we make this better with technology behind it, I just think the brand will be right back where it needs to be, which is, it's a premium experience. It's a crafted experience. It's an experience that our partners provide with some level of humanity that you actually don't get anywhere else.\nIt just creates an environment where you like being there, whether you're a partner or a customer. Sorry, a long answer to that, but this is what I'm most excited about because it was really good learning over the last couple of months to understand where we zeroed in in order to get the unlock.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good afternoon. Brian, on the four minutes or less, how does in-store compare to MOP today? I think it was a few quarters ago, there was a high mix of customers that walked away from MOP orders due to high wait times. So curious if you could talk about where that's trending today. And then separately, just big picture, if you were able to get all transactions under four minutes, how would you frame the comp opportunity?\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nYeah. Well, I would frame it as it would go up. And what I would also tell you is the good news is we've got some really good learning that when the mobile order promise time gets beyond 15 minutes, that's when we have people kind of bailing. So what we're testing is if you can do these time slots or if you can do these promise times in such a way where it doesn't get past, let's call it 12 to 15 minutes, then we know we're going to delight the mobile order customer. And then that frees up the capacity so that the in-store customer can have roughly a four-minute experience. And what we've seen over and over again is when that happens, now granted, this is my pilot store I'm going off of, everything starts to move in harmony, right?\nIt's like the partners aren't rushed or overwhelmed, so they have the ability to provide the experience, the connectivity that we want, the craft and the product that they want to provide. The customer feels like they're seen, they're valued, they've been heard, and they have a moment of connection. That's what we want to ultimately deliver. That's, frankly, why Starbucks is Starbucks, because in the end, you get this craft, customized beverage in a reasonable amount of time in a way that actually has a touch of humanity that you, frankly, may not get in other points of your day. As we improve that experience, it's really amazing to see just how the whole vibe of the coffeehouse just kind of calms down and you can kind of settle in.\nAnd therefore the ceramic mugs, glasses, and plates just add another level of like, \"Hey, this is a spot where I can slow down, take a minute, whether I'm connecting with others or just taking a minute for myself. This is what occurs.\" And at the same token for the customer that needs to get in, get out, we're setting them up for success too. Versus right now, the first in, first out mobile situation overwhelms the proposition at times. And when it happens, it's not good. And so we got to figure out how we don't let those instances occur ongoing.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. And the last question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. You may ask your question.\n\nJon Tower\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nNice. Great. Thanks for taking the question. It's a quick clarification then a question. Rachel, quick on the clarification piece.\nOn the second quarter, are you, from an EPS growth standpoint, suggesting that it's going to be lower than what we saw, the 23.5% contraction in the first quarter in the second quarter? That's the clarification. Then on the question piece, I'm just curious, Brian, from a high level, you guys are the global coffee leader with respect to sales and the footprint, and yet you hold a premium price point across many of the markets and menu items. So can you help us think through, now that obviously you're talking about even doubling the store base in the U.S. to something like 34,000 stores over time, how you think through the company, how you balance the two forces of being the most distributed potentially and yet keeping pricing and price points where they are today and what that means for pricing power over time?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nJohn, I'll start and I'll take the first part, which is, yes, we expect that margin and earnings will, on an absolute basis, be the lowest in Q2. That's based on seasonality, but it's also reflecting the organizational restructure as well as the elevated investments. What that means is earnings year-over-year pressure will intensify, and that's largely driven by the organizational restructure. So that's how I would think about Q2, but then we would expect gradual improvement in the back half of the year. And specific to EPS, we would expect that you'll see improvement sequentially and year-over-year in the back half of the year.\n\nBrian Niccol\n\nChairman and CEO, Starbucks\n\nAnd to your second question, look, I think this is where innovation has to be a part of our model. And the good news is it's also one of the things that's always been a part of the Starbucks business.\nYou're going to continue to see us innovate on food and beverage. It's going to be both from a standpoint of making sure that we've got the right pricing architecture across the menu and that it also serves the right occasions, whether it's a morning occasion or an afternoon occasion, as well as age. We want to make sure we got the right flavors and tea and coffee so that we're relevant for the different taste profiles based on people's age. Innovation is going to be a key piece of the puzzle to keep the brand relevant, keep the menu relevant.\nAnd then when you do that innovation, we're going to be very cognizant of the pricing architecture that we're bringing forward to support still, \"Hey, this is a premium experience, but we want to make sure we maintain being accessible.\" And so you're going to see us leverage food and drink innovation to carry the day as it relates to pricing architecture, occasions, as well as taste. So I think that was the last question. Yeah. Okay. Well, let's wrap up. So first of all, thanks for all the questions. Obviously, I'm a couple of months into this, but truly energized by just seeing the resiliency, the humanity of this brand, and the relevance of this brand around the world.\nThe opportunity to travel not only kind of coast to coast, but then to Asia, Europe, and Latin America, it really is so inspiring to see what our brand is able to do for our partners and our customers around the world. And along those lines, I do want to say a big thank you to all our partners around the world because they make the brand so special. And what we're committed to doing is making sure that we create the systems so that we can continue to provide that special experience for everybody. So Q1, obviously, in 2025 results, met our expectations, clearly showed some signs of progress, but I think it's clear we still have much work to do. The good news is I feel like we know the work that we need to do.\nWe're working to build a Starbucks that I think we'll all be really proud of because we're going to have a clear mission and purpose. We're going to, once again, be loved for our coffee, love for the warmth, love for kind of the welcoming coffeehouse, the Green Apron partners that we have. There's a great piece in our building when you walk around here. One of the questions is asked, \"What's one word that describes Starbucks?\" The word that gets written up on the wall is love. I think that should not be lost on what we're trying to do for our customers and our partners. So it's a critical year in front of us.\nWe have a lot of work to do to get back to Starbucks, but I believe we do this work, we will position the company for tremendous future growth. I want you to also hear we're moving quickly on all these things. I'm committed to executing with excellence. Once we have clarity on those things, we'll deliver on our commitments. So, look, in closing, I'm confident, okay, that we're going to create economic opportunity for our partners, provide an experience that's worth it for our customers, and generate long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. This is why we love doing these jobs. I'm just really excited about what's in front of us at Starbucks. So thank you for joining us and have a great afternoon.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThis concludes Starbucks' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call.

Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to discuss Starbucks Q3, FY 2024 results. Today's discussion will be led by Laxman Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer, and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statement should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. GAAP results in Q3, FY 2024's comparative period include several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, and other items.\nThese items are excluded from our Non-GAAP results. All numbers referenced on today's call are on a Non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted or there is no Non-GAAP adjustment related to the metric. As part of our Non-GAAP results, revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth metrics on today's call are measured in constant currency, whereby current period results are converted into United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period, rather than the actual exchange rates for the current period, excluding related hedging activities.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Let me start by laying out our results for this quarter. Our Q3 total company revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year and 6% over Q2. Our global comparable store sales declined 3% year-over-year, driven by a negative 2% comp growth in North America and a negative 14% comp growth in China, and partially offset by strong performance in Japan. Our global operating margins contracted by 70 basis points to 16.7%, and overall earnings per share for the quarter was $0.93. Our total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China, was challenged. We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact. Leading business and operational indicators are trending in the right direction ahead of our financial results, and our runway for improvement is long.\nWe see green shoots in our US business driven by the three-part action plan outlined last quarter. First, meet and unlock capacity for new demand through a relentless focus on improvements to our US store operations and on elevating the experience we create for our partners and customers. Second, attract new customers and drive transaction growth by launching and integrating more exciting new products with relevant marketing while maintaining our focus on core coffee-forward offerings. And third, reach new customers and demonstrate our value by making sure customers believe the Starbucks experience is worth it every time. First, our largest opportunity: meet and unlock capacity for new demand. A relentless focus on improving operational execution across our nearly 10,000 US company-operated stores is the cornerstone of our near-term plan. While it is early days of progress, our plan is working.\nIf you walk away from today's call with one thought, let it be the significant changes and long-term upside potential taking place within our US stores and across our end-to-end supply chain to unlock growth, enhance the customer experience, and drive cost efficiencies. Within our stores, we've seen material positive momentum across core store health and performance metrics, with notable improvements in partner scheduling and turnover, critical store issues, and inventory management. Stores ranked in our top two operational performance quartiles reached a new high during the quarter, a 28% upwards shift from Q2, but we have more opportunity. Our focus on operational excellence, driven by a Reinvention plan, has led to a multi-second year-over-year improvement in out-of-the-window times, a nearly 50% reduction in calls received by our Customer Contact Center for \"My order took too long,\" and Mobile Order & Pay and delivery uptime rates of 99%.\nThese are key indicators of our work to drive growth by addressing customer wait times, product availability, and the customer experience. This quarter, we also introduced phase one of our Siren Craft Systems, which includes several process and partner-driven enhancements to our US store operations. Changes include a new peak time clay caller role, strategic investments in partner hours, training, new routines, simple enhancements to technology, and an evolved beverage build process. Early deployment across 1,200 stores demonstrated a material incremental improvement across key performance, throughput, efficiency, and reliability metrics. Encouraged by this, we fully deployed Siren Craft Systems process improvements across our entire portfolio of US company-operated stores this week. Later this quarter, we will begin rolling out a simple refit to our espresso machines, which we expect to improve espresso throughput by up to 15% without compromising quality.\nWith a minor software change in our store production systems, we have a similar ability to improve food throughput. When paired with Siren System equipment announced as part of our Reinvention plan, these new processes become a force multiplier that we expect to drive a true step-change improvement. Early assessments demonstrate the capability to drive a 10- to 20-second wait time reduction and a resulting comp opportunity range of 1 to 1.5%. Leveraging our Deep Brew analytics platform, we have identified customer experience outlier stores, approximately 10% of our network, and have developed targeted plans to address and improve them, including accelerated Siren System deployment. Similarly, we are accelerating the pace of our new store builds and renovations, with 580 net new builds and more than 800 renovations planned in North America for FY 2024.\nStore development efforts are focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where we see population growth, and forecast both underserved demand and high incrementality. Increasingly, these new store builds and renovations also include Siren System equipment. In line with prior guidance, we remain on track to deploy equipment in less than 10% of company-operated stores by the end of FY 2024 and about 40% by the end of FY 2026. Building on our pilot, Starbucks and Gopuff have agreed to terms for an expanded relationship to open 100 delivery-only kitchens across the US. We're also accelerating the rollout of digital storyboards, with target deployment across most US stores in the next two years, a year earlier than originally anticipated. Lastly, we're working on other ways to enhance the café experience.\nThis includes new and expanded seating options that elevate many stores while upholding a safe and inviting place for partners and customers. A key outcome of our operational efforts has been material and sustained improvements to the partner experience. Driven by precision partner-centric staffing and scheduling efforts, we ended the quarter with a new post-pandemic low partner turnover rate, the best shift completion rate in two years, and a 13% improvement in average hours per partner, now the highest on record. These initiatives create more stability in our stores, provide more predictability for our partners, and sustain our experience flywheel. Looking beyond our stores, we continue to realize new efficiencies, cost savings, and performance improvements across our end-to-end supply chain, thanks to strong support from our suppliers, and we see even more headroom. We have a structured process to realize significant continued improvements across our end-to-end supply chain.\nWe are ahead of plan on productivity. We expect our productivity to drive efficiency and unlock capital from areas that don't touch the customer. In turn, these savings will enable us to target investments that drive value for our customers beginning later in Q4, reigniting our North America flywheel for growth. We're early days on this journey, building both our strategic sourcing and revenue management capabilities. Our second priority is to drive demand through relevant product innovation, with coffee at our core. We've seen meaningful improvement here as well. This quarter, we drove traffic into our stores through an engaging and innovative pipeline of products supported by integrated marketing campaigns. Cold share was up 1% year-over-year, representing 76% of our beverage mix through the quarter. Our newly formulated iced coffee received positive feedback.\nOur strength in cold espresso innovation continued to drive the platform's growth, up 4% year-over-year. We launched Starbucks Milano Duetto whole bean coffee in Milan, ahead of a global launch this October. Beyond coffee, our new Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers, beverages with Pearls drove the highest week one product launch in our history. Their success buoyed the entire Starbucks Refreshers beverage platform to an all-time high during the quarter. As mentioned in Q2, we continue to build out our 24-month product pipeline while accelerating our pace of innovation. For example, recognized the growing appeal and opportunity created by the energy category, we launched a new Handcrafted Iced Energy beverages across our US stores in just three months compared to a normal 12 to 18.\nLooking forward, we believe our Q4 product offerings, including the return of Pumpkin Spice, combined with supporting marketing activities and offers, provides the right formula to drive customer interest, demand, and deeper engagement with both new and existing customers. Our third and final near-term priority is to reach new customers and demonstrate the value we offer by ensuring the Starbucks experience is worth it every time. Recognizing the premium position of our brand, we've been measured in our use of offers. During this quarter, only 14% of our transactions were driven by offers compared to a competitor average of 29%. Of offer-driven transactions, 10% were star-based offers targeted to Starbucks Rewards Members. Only 4% were driven by price-based offers. Our best offers are in the app.\nTogether, offers and other integrated marketing activities, when paired with exciting product innovation, successfully grew Starbucks Rewards membership, reactivated many lapsed Rewards members, and drove customer traffic on promotional days and product launch weeks. Active US Starbucks Rewards members grew to 33.8 million during the quarter. Members across every decile increased the frequency of their visits. We're focused on the continued growth of the program because the average active member spends materially more annually and drives a higher lifetime value for the business than a non-member. Research also tells us that the most inactive Starbucks Rewards members don't realize they've lapsed. This demonstrates a continued opportunity to drive return visits, active member growth, and deeper customer loyalty. Looking forward, we will continue to use more targeted offers coupled with select pricing actions funded by efficiency initiatives to drive traffic and conversion.\nWe plan to leverage a mix of paid media acquisition and retention offers, disruptive signage, and partner education to drive transactions and increase the frequency of visits, with a focus on product launches and continued Starbucks Rewards member growth. It's worth remembering the ubiquity of the Starbucks brand and our ability to intercept customers. For instance, our business is up 13% in airports and up 9% in hotels, pointing to these trends. Leveraging our brand and our ability to intercept customers while demonstrating value not just in price, but through a premium experience, remains a sizable opportunity across our entire store portfolio. Moving on to digital, as part of our action plan, we made continued improvements to our Starbucks App, including wait time algorithm enhancements that have improved order ready accuracy by nearly 50 percentage points.\nThis, combined with in-app offers, helped drive a 10% year-over-year growth in Mobile Order & Pay revenue and a 7% year-over-year increase in MOP transactions. Looking deeper, our data shows that one in four non-Starbucks Rewards members want the ability to use Mobile Order Pay. Nearly 80% of those customers don't want to join a rewards program or create an account to do it. In response, we opened MOP for All to provide those customers the convenience they seek while removing perceived barriers to entry. We believe these enhancements to the digital experience, coupled with more effortless ordering, will continue to drive Starbucks Rewards membership over time, with customers increasing frequency and spend. Once customers are in our digital ecosystem, they're more likely to remain engaged across channels and drive greater lifetime value. In summary, our plans are beginning to work. We're recovering our brand from misperceptions.\nWe're rebuilding the operational foundation of our stores and supply chain. We're reducing costs to support investments. We're sustaining partner experience improvements. And we're working to make the Starbucks experience worth it every time. While it's early days, I'm confident in the trajectory of our US business and the operational improvements we're making. And I'm reassured by the impact our work is expected to deliver in FY 2025 and beyond. Looking outside the US, we continue to see weakness in parts of our international business and strength in others. Headwinds persist in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, driven by widely discussed misperceptions about our brand. In some European markets, consumers are stretched. At the same time, we see significant strength in markets like Japan and parts of Latin America.\nChina is one of our most notable international challenges and an area I'd like to talk about in more detail. The competitive market dynamics in China are reflected in our recent results. We've continued to face a more cautious consumer spending and intensified competition. In the past year, unprecedented store expansion and a mass segment price war at the expense of comp and profitability have also caused significant disruptions to the operating environment. Still, we have made progress in important areas. Through Q3, metrics like average daily transactions, weekly sales, and operating margin improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Starbucks Rewards members grew by 1.6 million to a record high, 22 million active members. And customer connection scores reached a new high, while partner turnover reached a new low. We've built an amazing business in China over the past 25 years, a business for China built by an outstanding local team.\nWe've pioneered the growth of the premium coffee industry in the market with our Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands, and brand equity remains distinctive. We're incredibly committed and expert partners with an unmatched depth in coffee and craft. Our stores are distinctive and industry-leading, and our supply chain is world-class. New stores have expanded our presence to more than 900 county cities and continue to drive exceptional cash-on-cash returns and a payback of less than two years. We're looking beyond near-term challenges and towards long-term opportunities in the market. We built Starbucks in China around three principles. A great customer experience is grounded in a great partner experience. Our coffee will always be distinctive and high quality, with low penetration relative to other markets, which provides continued headroom. Our beautiful stores will celebrate the culture and traditions of China and their local communities.\nEven in a challenging market, we have stayed true to these principles and our relative premium positioning. This is reflective in the competitive margins we have sustained in the face of price competition. Over the past 25 years, we've gone through different phases of growth in China and have relied on different strategic partnerships to grow our business and capabilities, like joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate, and supply chain. As we look forward, we see higher growth and margin opportunities in China. We're building the next generation of Starbucks grounded in our premium brands and with a business that is even more digital, innovative, and locally relevant. To do so, as our strategy evolves, we are in the early stages of exploring strategic partnerships to further enhance our competitive position, to accelerate growth, and innovate to win in the long term in China.\nWe remain completely committed to our business and our partners in China for the next 25 years and beyond. The long-term opportunity for us is significant. Before I close, I would like to confirm that Elliott Management is a shareholder in our company, and our conversations to date have been constructive. On the business, my continued confidence is rooted in the focus, energy, and effort of our partners across the business and around the globe. Our growing culture of focused innovation and relentless execution continues to enhance our capabilities, operational muscle, and executional discipline, driving forward our action plan and our long-term Triple Shot strategy while helping return the business to sustainable algorithmic growth. With that, I'll turn this over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Laxman. Good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, we're seeing progress against our three-part action plans.\nAdditionally, our efficiency efforts, which are tracking ahead of expectations, partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. With continued focus on our action plans, efficiency efforts, and disciplined operational execution, we expect progress as we close out the year. With that, let me turn to our results. Our Q3 consolidated revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, demonstrating sequential revenue growth quarter-over-quarter, consistent with what we guided. Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by 8% net new company-operated store growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales from a 5% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket as we continue to navigate through a value-driven consumer environment. US led the average ticket increase of 4%, driven by pricing and multi-beverage orders. The increase in average ticket in the US.\nreflects how our innovative products and thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value, indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold. Shifting to transactions, US posted a comparable transaction decline of 6%, primarily driven by non-SR members. Across SR customers, as Laxman shared, we saw improved frequency across all deciles. Mobile Order & Pay in the US remained strong in the quarter, with positive year-over-year total transaction growth of 7% as customers continue to value both the experience and convenience of the Mobile Order & Pay channel. As we open our app for all with MOP guest checkout, which launched earlier this month, we expect to create and deliver value across a broader population, expanding our universe of known customers to deepen engagement, driving increased frequency and spend. In addition to strong SR program growth in the US, we saw strong SR program growth in China.\nSR members grew to a record 22 million 90-day active members in China. In June, we also enhanced the program through extending rewards and introducing new diamond tier, which provides exclusive benefits to our most loyal SR members. We're pleased with the SR member growth across both the US and China and expect to see the benefit from this growth in future quarters as new members provide a longer-term benefit. Shifting to margins, our Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 70 basis points from the prior year to 16.7%, primarily driven by increased promotional activities, investments in store partner wages and benefits, as well as deleverage. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against Reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as out-of-store efficiencies, which primarily center around our supply chain.\nAs you've heard Laxman discuss, we're focused on improving operational execution and efficiencies, which is now more important than ever as we build resiliency in our business. Our efficiency efforts are built on creating sustainable improvements in our operations and end-to-end supply chain, allowing us to both reinvest in our business and drive margin expansion. A testament to these efforts includes the achievement in excess of 200 basis points in year-over-year efficiency gains as of Q3 across both in-store and out-of-store areas, manifesting through our business in reduced store operating expenses and product and distribution costs, respectively. Collectively, these line items represent approximately 85% of our annual spend. Our in-store focus, a combination of efficiencies in staffing and scheduling, as well as enhancements in our store equipment and new store format design, has fueled a reduction in partner turnover, creating greater stability in our stores.\nWe believe that stability not only creates opportunity to nurture stronger connections with customers, but also increases productivity, which translated to roughly 110 basis points improvement in store operating expense in the quarter. Our efficiency focus also extends outside of the store, as we've been taking a hard look across our supply chain and other areas, including G&A. As Laxman shared, we're working collaboratively with suppliers to identify opportunities to leverage our scale for cost reductions without compromising product quality or distribution timeliness, which led to meaningful savings in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points between rebates and rate savings. In addition, we believe our end-to-end supply chain focus gives us the opportunity to increase inventory availability with the right products at the right time, enhancing the customer experience while reducing waste.\nAs we've shared, G&A was elevated at more than 7% of revenue through Q2, as we have deliberately invested in resources to continue to grow our technology capability. We have, however, reduced G&A in Q3 and expect it to remain closer to 6% of revenue in the second half of this fiscal year as we balance investments for our long-term growth. When considering our progress this fiscal year, our in-store and out-of-store year-to-date efficiency efforts collectively amounted to nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement. Our significant efficiency runway, coupled with sales growth, gives us confidence to drive margin expansion over time. Given this, we have ample opportunities to deliver above our initial goal of $3 billion, driving to $4 billion in efficiencies over the next four years. Q3 EPS was $0.93, down 6% from the prior year.\nThe decline was driven largely by the cautious consumer environment, which in response drove increased promotions and marketing in the quarter, partially offset by our efficiency efforts. Additionally, our higher effective tax rate had a $0.03 unfavorable impact, driven by fewer discrete items relative to the prior year. With segment results being discussed in detail in today's Q3 earnings release, I'll now touch on our capital allocation and financial resilience, and then move into guidance. As a reminder, our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to drive financial flexibility, allowing us to continue to make the necessary investments in our business to drive long-term growth. Our new stores continue to be a meaningful part of our growth equation, with approximately 85% of our CapEx allocated to our stores, both new stores and renovations. These high-return, growth-oriented investments have superior economics while adding incrementally to our business.\nEven with over 16,700 stores across the US and another 7,300 in China, we have abundant white space ahead, particularly as populations continue to move to more suburban and rural areas. Take a Tier 3 market in the US, for example, a place like Joplin, Missouri. A drive-through in that market boasts a year-one ROI in excess of 65%, with cash margins approaching 30% and a payback period of less than two years. Year-one AUVs reach approximately $2 million, with opportunity ahead as we build out the trade area. Importantly, our new store revenue is highly incremental, adding an average of nearly 90% to the trade area attained by our world-class store development partners and their rigorous work that leverages AI-assisted strategic site selection process. We see that in China as well. Take a new county city, for example.\nWe're in only about 900 of the nearly 3,000 across the market. Today, we see year-one ROI as high as 70%, with cash margins averaging over 30% as we've successfully managed both store development and operating costs, even in the current macroeconomic backdrop. We believe this is a great investment and a creator of shareholder value, building out the long-term opportunity. With our disciplined approach to capital allocation, underpinned by our strengthening store portfolio, we are reinforcing our financial resilience while remaining committed to our compelling dividend. We continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale, resulting in a significant portion of our earnings going directly back to our shareholders.\nConcurrently, we have maintained a leverage target below three times lease adjusted EBITDA, ensuring a strong financial foundation and consistent with our investment-grade credit rating of BBB+, which allows us to continue to access capital efficiently. Collectively, our disciplined approach enables us to preserve both balance sheet strength and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment. Moving to our fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are encouraged with our progress this quarter, and we're pleased to reaffirm all metrics of our full year 2024 guidance. Our confidence is underpinned by the results of our action plans, coupled with the continued efficiency unlocked both in and out of store. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are seeing progress against our action plans. Second, our efficiency efforts partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment.\nThird, we believe our financial fortitude and disciplined capital allocation strategy positions us well for the long term. And last, our full year 2024 guidance remains intact. Before I close, I want to acknowledge all of our partners across the globe working tirelessly each and every day to elevate the Starbucks Experience in our stores, at our roasting plants, and in our support centers. You are and always have been our superpower. Thank you, partners. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. Your first question comes from Brian Harbour, Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes. Thank you. Good afternoon.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nHello, Brian.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI wanted to ask a couple of things on kind of the margin and cost side. First of all, G&A, could you talk more about what actions were taken there? Do you still see that as kind of a source of leverage as we go into fiscal 25? And then on the store side, you're obviously generating quite a bit of efficiency. I think you alluded to reinvesting some of that. Where will that go? And then as we also kind of think to next year, is there some continued need for reinvestment, whether it's in labor or certain other things? Could you shed some more light on that?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nSure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with the G&A actions. So in the quarter, our G&A actually declined year-over-year by about 5%.\nThe drivers of that include performance-based compensation, so lower performance-based compensation, coupled with lapping over some foundation investments from the prior year. In addition to that, given the environment, we made some deliberate decisions to focus on cost efficiencies, which helped us offset some of the investments we've made in wages and benefits, as well as the investments we've made in technology. We'll expect that to further into Q4. As we look to the out years, we will continue to drive leverage in our G&A as part of our overall efficiency focus and efforts. Now, on the store side, you asked about reinvesting. Where does that go? And as far as our in-store and out-of-store efficiencies, those investments largely this year have helped to support the promotional activities, as well as the investments we've made in our partner wages and benefits.\nNow, as we look towards next year, we'll continue on our path of efficiency efforts. Those efforts will help us to be able to unlock the capacity to be able to reinvest back into our business in a variety of different areas, but it will also allow us to drive margin expansion. So I think that answered all of your questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the comp composition. So I think, Rachel, you mentioned average check benefited from multi-beverage orders, which I guess suggests that perhaps you're not seeing premiumization or customization anymore, but rather just increased group sizes. And then you also mentioned pricing, how much price you have year-over-year, if you could give any color on that.\nAnd then the final piece, you talked about much lower promotional intensity or mix than what we see from some of your competitors. But I'm trying to understand how does that 14% compare perhaps to what Starbucks might have seen in the past. Thanks.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nSure, Sara. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the 4% comp. So in the US business, our ticket comp increased by 4%. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, that does include about 25% of it was related to beverage attach or multi-beverage orders in response to our promotional offers. So it showed that our customers responded well to our offers. So that's really the driver of it. We aren't seeing the customization and the personalization in the same way because our offers were much more targeted and driven around specific beverages as well as overall beverage attach.\nAnd so as a result of that, that drove the ticket in the quarter. But we were pleased with that because it shows that customers responded well to those offers. Now, when we think about price year-over-year in that 4% ticket, I would say the remainder of the ticket, about 75%, is really net price. That includes everything from pricing moves, including the increases that we took in California, coupled with the promotional offers. So I'd say that's a net pricing impact on that 4%. And in terms of the promotional intensity, I'll turn it over to Laxman in a minute. But what I can say about the promotional environment is we've been very measured from a promotional standpoint, given the fact that we have a premium positioning as our brand.\nSo the majority of our promotional efforts were focused on driving growth in our Starbucks Rewards membership because we know that those members tend to increase their value for us over the lifetime. It's a more efficient way for us to promote. In the quarter, we were pleased with the fact that between the offers and the marketing activities, we were able to grow our Starbucks Rewards membership in the US as a result of that. We also saw traffic increase on days where we had offers as well as days where we had new product launches. That also gave us some encouragement just in terms of the effectiveness of our offers. With that, I'll turn it over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nSara, just to build on the question that you asked in Rachel's response, the Starbucks brand is grounded in the idea that if you exceed the partner expectations, you will exceed the customer expectations. And it is in this experience that we deliver the premiumness of the brand. And when you look at the words worth it for the Starbucks Experience, what we measure in our work and brand equity is not just about price. It is about the quality, the distinctive quality, the product customization that you mentioned, the consistency of the experience that we create both in stores and digitally, delivered at a price that customers believe is worth it when they come into the store to transact with us or when they transact with us across channels.\nNow, one of the things that we have been very careful about is that given the premiumness of the brand, we've been very careful about the offers. As Rachel said, it is at a lower intensity than it is for some of the other brands. What we've tried to do is focus on the Starbucks Rewards members. For our business, 60% of our revenue comes from the SR program, and 40% comes from the non-SR program. What we've found is that some of these offers that we have done, particularly for our Starbucks Rewards members, have helped drive engagement and incremental visits. We talked a bit about the fact that we've seen engagement go up in every decile of the Starbucks Rewards members.\nIf I look at our non-SR customers, which is about 40% of it, what we've been working on is ensuring that we give them offers to come in and become part of the SR program. Additionally, they've told us about a fourth of them tell us that they want the digital convenience, but they don't necessarily want to be part of the program. So we've done things around how we open up the app for them to order and get the digital convenience. What we see over time is for the non-SR customers, we still have the opportunity to target price investments funded by the progress we're making in our efficiency program. All the way brings it back to our three-part action plan in terms of what we're doing to continue to deliver the kind of premium experience Starbucks is about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. My question was on China. The headwinds, Laxman, as you mentioned, are seemingly large. The comp's down 14%. I think you mentioned or just highlighted the rampant competition, the macro challenges, and the price wars. But with that said, I know you mentioned exploring strategic partnerships, and you've had partnerships in the past. Just curious if you could provide some more color. I know in the past, the board has evaluated alternatives such as the licensing of China, similar to other multinational QSRs, which would kind of allow you to participate in the growth, but mitigate the volatility and reduce your capital needs.\nI'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that, whether that was kind of the reference you made earlier, maybe some of the pros and cons as you contemplate the potential for those strategic alternatives such as licensing. Any color would be great. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThanks so much. We've built a distinctive business in China with both the Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands that are relatively more premium relative to what we have in the market. We've got 60,000 partners, 19,000 of them who are black aprons and coffee. So the depth of coffee expertise we have is tremendous. Additionally, as we look at the really long term, the potential in this business is amazing. I mean, we've essentially very early days, given the per caps we see and the headroom that it provides.\nSo the stores, the brand, the partners, the supply chain, the digital presence we have, all are distinctive advantages. But as you rightfully said, there's been quite a change in the competitive environment. And we've been very entrepreneurial. I mean, 25 years ago when Howard went to China, we've created a specialty coffee industry from pretty much nowhere. And we've been very entrepreneurial, and we've looked at various ways of making that happen, including joint ventures and partnerships, strategic partnerships in technology, real estate, and supply chain. We're frankly at the very early stages of this. And so I don't want to necessarily comment specifically on any one option versus another, but we're at the early stages. And we recognize that what we want to be sure of is that we are further strengthening our advantage in this market because the long-term opportunity for us is significant.\nAnd we will update you as we make progress on this effort in terms of exploring these strategic partnerships.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director, BTIG\n\nGreat. Thank you. I think you guys mentioned that traffic was down 6% in the US. And the majority of that was due to the non-Rewards customers, which makes up, call it 40% of your business. That's a pretty substantial decline in that customer base, probably a double-digit decline in that customer base. So can you just talk a little bit about where you think these customers are going and why is it that it's such a steep decline in this customer count in just this segment? Thank you very much.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nSo first of all, I think we are operating in a challenging consumer environment. You see the impact of that in away-from-home consumption.\nIf you look at our business at home, the grocery stores with our brands, you're seeing volume increase. You're seeing share increase in a category that's in decline, but we're seeing volume increase at home. In our ready-to-drink business, we're seeing clearly that that has some challenges. But with the work that our joint venture team is doing, we're seeing progress there. But away from home consumption, you see the impact of the challenging consumer environment. What we're focused on is what is it that we can do to control what we have. And so the Starbucks Rewards members, you see greater engagement. That is 60% of our revenue. Clearly, if you look at the sort of lower deciles of the Starbucks Rewards program, we see opportunity even there for them to increase their visitations.\nBut if I look at what we're seeing with our non-SR customers, we still maintain the number one position in terms of coffee shops visited from the research that we do internally and for the equity work we've done. So I think that this is a statement around the overall environment. We know that there are things that we can do in order to communicate value better to our non-SR customers, which is why we've opened up the app for all starting this quarter. And once they come in and once they see what's happening inside the convenience of the Mobile Order Pay channel, they will get exposed to what we have inside the app.\nWe know that we have an opportunity as we look at the end-to-end efficiencies that we can get in our supply chain that we can target price investments in those areas that will help them realize the price proposition that we have overall. If you really step back and look at us, we've been very disciplined over the last many years. We've taken less pricing than many, but we also recognize the environment we're operating in is challenged. So I think what you'll see us do is be measured in the way we do this and do it through the app and target price investments where appropriate, leveraging off the efficiency work that Rachel spoke about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please state your question.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe first a clarification on the question.\nRachel, you mentioned the $4 billion in savings. Just want to ensure that's a gross or a net number. And then I guess maybe going to the Siren stations that you've talked about, I know you're still on track to get 40% or less than 40% done in North America by the end of fiscal 2026. Can you talk about what you're seeing with respect to returns and what's the impediment to accelerating that type of remodel schedule, picking it up, say, instead of less than 40% by the end of 2026, picking that up to 50, 60, or pulling forward more to current fiscal 2025, say?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nJon, I'll start with on the $4 billion of savings over the next four years, that is a net number. So we have obviously a larger gross number to ensure that we can deliver on that. So that's the way I think about the savings.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nOn your second question on the Siren System and the equipment deployment, well, firstly, we've deployed the process improvements across all our stores in the US this week. This has been very well received. The inclusion of the new routines, the training, the beverage builds, the partner investments, that we will see transaction impact with that. Now, we have matched our Siren System equipment rollouts with the renovations of store builds because of the returns that that gives us. But it's not stopping us from actually using those Siren System equipment in order for us to de-bottleneck these outlier stores. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the work we've done with Deep Brew and the analytics that we have, there are 10% of our stores that have the highest customer service outages.\nFor these 10% stores, there's less than 1,000, right? There's work going on store by store. And what we're doing store by store is to look to see a combination of process improvements, how we run the stores, as well as looking at a renovation cycle to potentially re-sequence them in order for us to bring the Siren systems in an accelerated fashion to help us de-bottleneck these stores. Now, later this quarter, we're going to start rolling out a couple of things that will help us attack some of the bottleneck areas we see. For example, this retrofit to our espresso machines, same quality, higher throughput. We're going to see the rollout start to over 6,000 espresso constrained stores starting next quarter. We're doing the same thing with some of the software changes we're making around food and how we drive throughput there.\nSo these are targeted sequenced efforts that will have high impact on those stores with the greatest constraints. You will see Clover Vertica in all stores by the end of fiscal year 2025. So we're going at this, not just waiting for the whole system, but looking at portions of it that we can bring in in a more accelerated fashion in order for us to drive throughput in the stores.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nIf I would just add one more point to that, it is, I think, important to note that the Siren System equipment is a major overhaul to our overall stores, our engine. It requires quite a bit of CapEx as well as quite a bit of change management. So we intentionally leverage the renovation and new store process because it allows us to optimize the costs while taking advantage of downtime.\nSo that's also an important note in terms of how we've been thoughtful about how we roll these systems out more broadly.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question. Sharon Zackfia, your line is open. Please unmute yourself. All right. We'll move on to the next question. And our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research, Baird\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the US business. A lot of encouraging commentary about some of the internal metrics you're seeing in the business there. But I was hoping maybe you could talk about how that's translating to sales performance and whether you're already starting to see sales responding to some of the progress you're making. And maybe more specifically, if you expect the fourth quarter comp growth or transaction growth in the US or North America to be better than what you saw in the third quarter. Thanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nLet me start with the three-part action plan that we had in place. The first one was fixing our stores. I think that we're making strong progress here. So if you just look at examples of MOP, the growth rate we had quarter-over-quarter, which was, sorry, year-over-year, which was a 10% growth, the uptime that we had in MOP, obviously big improvements. That's an example of the kind of improvements that we're seeing. Our drive-throughs are more efficient. I mean, the multi-second improvements we've seen clearly translate as well into our ability to meet the demand that we have. The product innovations, we touched on some of those that we have and the impact of those.\nThe Summer-Berry Refreshers, the highest sales we've ever had in the launch week, leading to the Refreshers platform reaching 18% of sales. So examples over there. And also the work we're doing with our SR program and increase in number and increase in the engagement of these. So those are all the metrics that we have in terms of the kind of improvements that we're seeing against the three-part action plan. As we look ahead into this quarter and we look at, for example, July, what you see in July is the fact that we are seeing shifts in routines in July. We normally see that from a seasonality perspective. But I think we see more pronounced changes in the routines in July in addition to some of the tech outages that have impacted people across industries.\nAnd so we see the disruptions, for example, of the airport stores that I mentioned or the hospitality stores where we're seeing strong growth. And so what I would say to you is that our guidance does, at the end of the day, reflect the challenging consumer environment and what we expect the comps to be flat to low single digit for the year. But what I expect is that these actions that we're putting in place will position us stronger to see growth in FY 2025.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nAnd just to remind that comp guidance range is a low single digit decline to flat.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nHead of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nHi. Can you hear me now?\n\nOperator\n\nYes.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nYes, we can.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nHead of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nOkay. Perfect. I felt like a Verizon commercial.\nI wanted to ask. I know you gave the kind of returns you're seeing in US new stores as well as in China, but I think with the weakness you're seeing in comps, it kind of begs the question of how committed you are to this kind of global rate of expansion in the 7% to 8% range for company-owned stores.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks",
    "content2": "Well, I'll just make a comment and then hand it to Rachel specifically. So first of all, we're not chasing a number. We look at every project that we have, every site, and we look at the incremental returns, the incrementality, the business that it brings, and we're entirely driven by ROI. And we see the strong cash-on-cash returns in the US. Rachel spoke to the kind of cash-on-cash returns we're seeing in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets where the headroom is large for us.\nI mean, we're underpenetrated in those markets. So if you look at the pipeline of real estate investments in the US, they're really targeted at the Tier 2, Tier 3 mostly. The work we've done with Deep Brew to identify the sites to ensure that we build, there's clearly work that's going into how we ensure that the returns we get in these sites are strong. In a very similar way in China, if you look at the cash-on-cash returns that we're getting in the lower-tier cities that we're expanding in, the cash returns are strong. So we're not really chasing a number. We're chasing a return. Where we see incrementality, where we see returns, we will invest.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThe only thing I would add to that is just given the fact that we do see these strong returns and the incremental nature to our overall business, we see the vast opportunity. We have a very rigorous site selection process. We also have an ability to be able to monitor overall performance. And the combination of all of that allows us to strengthen our portfolio through the growth of new stores. So we see it as an important part of our overall long-term growth algorithm. But I think what's important in what Laxman said is it really comes down to ensuring that we keep monitoring the overall economics. And as long as we see the kind of returns we see today, then it supports our long-term growth ambitions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you.\nWe generally have the perception that the US is the leading market for Starbucks around the world. Certainly, it is in terms of total sales. My question was, as you look around the world in Latin America, Europe, and Asia, and a lot of markets really are competitive and have challenging consumer environments, what have you, is there anything that you can point to that is being done particularly well in any of these markets from a food, from a service, from a beverage perspective that maybe can be some tangible leading indicators that we can start to get excited about as we think about fiscal 2025 and 2026 innovation past what you've already done? Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nI'll just point to our business in Japan.\nIt's been growing double digits, terrific range of innovation, great execution in stores, strengthened digital presence, and a brand that really celebrates the coffee house in Japan. I think if you look around the world, we have pockets of these pretty much everywhere. It may not necessarily be uniformly the case, but pretty much everywhere we have examples of our brand, the experience that we deliver, the products that we bring to bear, the speed of innovation that we have. And by the way, even in pockets in China, we have amazing stories of these in the US too. So I think that there is a broad set of examples that we constantly look at to learn from and find ways of scaling around the world. And that's what we mean at the heart of truly going global, which is our third imperative in our triple-shot strategy.\nIt is a way for us to share best practices across the world.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Thank you. So you've made some significant investments into staffing, scheduling, and partner wage and benefits over the years. And it does seem like it's making very good progress so far. But I was wondering if there are any major areas you see incremental opportunities. And just adding on to that, on one hand, you have the goals to improve the cost efficiencies and productivity. But on the other, you will continue to focus on partner and customer experience. So just curious to your thoughts as to how you strike a balance here. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nI feel very good about the progress we are making on delivering a more stable partner experience in our stores in the US.\nI think if I just look at the average hour per partner where we are, it's reached a real high, a historic high. So I feel good about that. I think part of what we are looking to continue to do is how we ensure we simplify in the stores, how we simplify our menus, how we simplify our beverage bills, how we simplify in our supply chain, what happens upstream versus downstream, and how we focus on training, how we ensure more consistency in the experiences that we deliver. The Siren Craft System is a great example of this.\nSome of the stories we've heard as we've rolled this out over the course of over the last several weeks, including this week across all our network, is just what it's doing in terms of the partner reception and the positivity we hear from partners, including what they say about their ability to connect with customers and also deliver a more personable experience in stores. So it's clearly this is the sort of thing that we have to do and just continue to make the right investments to deliver the right partner experience in order to exceed the customer expectations that I know a premium brand like ours is all about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nRestaurant and Food Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. I wanted to go back and look at some of the products and the value strategies from April through July.\nYou were very active with some of the new products, and they would be something beyond the coffee core. They would be things that you would think would drive not just the strong trial that you say, but incremental traffic to your business. And I know you were going to dial up some value marketing. Maybe you confirm if you felt like you did that. But I'm wondering, what do you think worked particularly well, not just in the first trial week or two, but on a more sustaining basis from that in these initiatives, including the value and the new products? And in light of the traffic decline of 6%, I'm wondering, what do you think were really the offsets? Has there been some decline in the coffee core, or is there a day part? Or how should we think about offsets to these things that you're doing?\nThanks very much.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, David. Let me just first start with coffee, right? I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've gone to one additional point on cold. So it's now 76. Obviously, that's seasonal, but it's 76. If you look at our espresso business, that's grown 4%. So espresso drinks are up 4%. So coffee has grown. And our distinctiveness is in coffee. And I think you'll see that in the kind of innovations and new products we bring, including the launch of Milano Duetto towards the end of this quarter. So coffee is core to who we are, distinctive in terms of breadth of what we bring, and the products will obviously have that. I think one of the things we did talk about was the fact that afternoons are an opportunity for us.\nAs we look at these new platforms of what we have launched, if I look at Pearls, for example, it was significantly ahead of what we thought it would be to the point where we ran out of supply. I think that it wasn't the supply issue necessarily, but it was more the demand was ahead of what we thought it would be. We had a pullback marketing. My sense is that as you look at what we now have in our stores, they're back in stores with new products, and it's a platform that we will continue to build over time. So we're not just launching a product. We're launching platforms. The energy platform. We've been in the energy business since 2007 with the launch of Double Shot and Triple Shot Espresso.\nWhat we now have is we have a zero-calorie energy platform that we are scaling, and it's building steadily and will be something that we are committed to over time. If you look at some of our food innovations, like the egg mozzarella pesto sandwich as an example, it's a terrific sandwich. And again, it's one that's going to join our core, but it's building systematically over time. We still have work to do on supply around how we ensure stability and reliability of supply, particularly in food, in order to get the kind of service that we're going to need across our 10,000 stores with the products that we launch. So that's an opportunity, David, that I think we still have. And the team is working very hard along with our suppliers in order to make that happen.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you all for the time today. If you take away one thing, let it be this: we are making real progress on our three-part plan. We are focused on what we can control in a consumer environment that can best be described as complex. Our teams are moving with urgency. I thank them for their efforts and for staying focused on what we can control. I have full confidence in the long-term potential of Starbucks worldwide. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes Starbucks' third quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call. You may now disconnect."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. Let me be clear from the beginning. Our performance this quarter was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. Our Q2 total company revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales declined 4% year-over-year, driven by a -3% comp growth in North America, led by declining traffic, and a -11% comp growth in China.\nOur global operating margins contracted by 140 basis points to 12.8%, and our overall earnings per share declined by 7% to $0.68. While these results do not reflect our strengths, our capabilities, or the opportunities ahead, we confront these challenges from a position of enduring strength.\nWe have led the industry for more than 50 years because we have built a different kind of company, one that exceeds our partner expectations, one that delivers a distinctive and unique experience for our customers, and one anchored in the love and craft of coffee.\nAs a result, our worldwide brand equity remains resilient and strong. Our leadership in coffee remains unmatched. Our global base of customers remains loyal. Our experiences are differentiated and elevated. Our partners are talented and engaged. Our forward-looking product pipeline is highly appealing. Our distinctive store development capability continues to perform incredibly well. Our network of stores is healthy and robust. Our stores are executing better than ever with a stronger operating foundation.\nOverall, partner engagement is very strong. Our Triple Shot with Two Pumps Reinvention Strategy continues to deliver, and our possibilities as a company remain limitless. Still, we face a challenging operating environment. Headwinds discussed last quarter have continued. In a number of key markets, we continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer, particularly with our more occasional customer, and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic, an impact felt broadly across the industry.\nIn the US, severe weather impacted both our US and Total Company comp by nearly 3% during the quarter. The remainder of our challenges were attributable to fewer visits from our more occasional customers. Turning elsewhere, we still see economic volatility in the Middle East, but we remain confident in the region's long-term growth opportunities. In China, we still see the effects of a slower-than-expected recovery, and we see fierce competition among value players in the market.\nBut we are strengthening our premium position, and our team in China continues to execute with terrific rigor and heart as the market shakeout continues and as demand recovers and matures. None of these realities are excuses. Some, like weather, are transitory. Others, like a more cautious consumer, may persist longer. But much is within our control. There are three execution opportunities in our US business I want to expand on.\nFirst, meet the demand we have across dayparts to drive future growth. Second, launch even more exciting and relevant new products while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. And third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We understand how to do this, and we have what we need to deliver against our plans. So as we look to the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, we're accelerating our work on the underlying execution engines that power our business to realize these opportunities. Let me talk you through each.\nFirst, meet the demand we have in the US across dayparts. The morning daypart is likely what you think of when you think of Starbucks. It is our peak, and it represents about half our business. It's coffee forward, heavily routine-based, and driven by strong loyalty. At our best, we bring in customers with distinctive coffee and a great experience. We convert them to Starbucks Rewards members. We build interest with new coffee innovations, and we encourage more frequent visits and food attach.\nBut we currently have a challenge meeting our peak morning demand in the US. For example, more than 60% of our morning business in the US comes from Starbucks Rewards members who overwhelmingly order with a Starbucks app. What's interesting, though, despite strong Mobile Order & Pay sales, we saw a mid-teens percent order incompletion rate within the order channel this past quarter. In other words, customers using MOP put items into their cart and sometimes chose not to complete their order, citing long wait times or product unavailability.\nHere lies opportunity. We're intensely focused and actively working on improving operational throughput by providing our partners with the right processes and tools and on giving our customers a better sense of when their order will be ready. Rollout of our equipment-driven Siren System is on track, but we're also fine-tuning the stall processes that underpin this new equipment.\nWe have been working for the past six months with the Toyota Production System Support Center to unlock additional capacity at our peak. What we saw through store tests was a real near-term opportunity to fundamentally improve how we operate our stores. The Siren Craft System, as we're calling it, requires no capital. The technology solutions are relatively straightforward, and we are working to roll it out in North American stores over the coming months.\nIn stores where we've used the Siren Craft System to optimize operations, we have already seen an increase in peak throughput, which we estimate to be worth nearly one comp point annually. The Siren Craft System also bolsters the highly incremental returns we expect from our equipment-driven Siren Systems as it is deployed in stores.\nTaken together, these new processes and new equipment systems act as complements and amplify efforts to unlock capacity at peak. Additionally, we are revamping and investing in our Deep Brew technology to improve wait time estimates and provide more transparency for customers. They are efforts we began last quarter and build on the many improvements we've made to the Starbucks app over the last 12 weeks, with introductions now on a four-week upgrade cycle.\nAnother reason customers choose not to complete their order is product availability. For example, our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes were a big hit with customers. But demand was so strong that we are currently only able to offer them in 2,000 of our US stores. We are ramping up supply chain investments to further improve availability with an initial focus on our customers' favorite items.\nIn summary, we are working to increase throughput and improve product availability to enhance the customer experience, improve convenience, and better capture existing demand. Over time, we believe these improvements will attract a larger subset of customers.\nI also want to talk about unmet overnight demand. We see it as a tremendous and untapped incremental opportunity. Last quarter, we mentioned we were conducting a pilot program to serve customers overnight between 5:00PM and 5:00AM when our stores are traditionally closed. During this pilot test, we doubled our business. Building off that success, we are aggressively pursuing options to build a $2 billion business over the next five years.\nOvernight opportunities are incremental and create a complement to our existing delivery business, which grew by double digits in the US this quarter with both ticket increase and transaction growth.\nIn addition to the overnight, we have unmet weekend demand potential. Starbucks attracts routine customers all week through the morning and the afternoon. While the weekend continues to attract our routine customers, we also see more families and kids. We are working to realize this demand potential through new product offerings, collaborations, marketing, and enhancements to the store experience. As you can see, there is significant demand in the morning and even more potential during afternoon, overnight, and the weekend we have yet to realize. We are accelerating our execution engines to meet it.\nSecond, launch more relevant and exciting new products for our US customers while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. We are the leader in coffee. We are overwhelmingly focused on our coffee forward products. Coffee continues to perform strongly. And for example, 63% of our beverage sales in the quarter were cold, up 1% from a year ago, driven by innovation.\nBeyond our core, there is more. We know we are challenged to bring new innovations with frequency and strong appeal across other dayparts. This winter, we brought back Pistachio Lattes, rolled out Oleato nationally, and launched a new core Iced Shaken Espresso. Our beverages were paired with new breakfast products like our Potato, Cheddar & Chive Bakes. Some of our new products did well and drove positive customer buzz, but not all met our expectations.\nThat reality, coupled with what our customers have told us, points to opportunity across both coffee and non-coffee, and by that, I mean refreshers, matcha, and chai, and across food to drive greater attach. Later in the quarter, we saw improvement. Our Lavender platform was extremely successful, including our Lavender Matcha, and it compares to some of the most successful launches we've ever had.\nBut to cut through, we're working to drive even more buzzworthy products and strengthening the supply of products that become popular. These efforts take time, but our team is working with great energy and speed to make both happen. We also invested in our brand over the past quarter to address recent misinformation. The work was effective in driving brand metrics, and our overall brand equity and affinity remains strong.\nAs we look ahead, we have an opportunity to better amplify our new products and to drive more awareness and excitement for those products, particularly among our more occasional customers. As we detail, we are accelerating the execution engines to help us drive more frequent and exciting product innovations, both in the core and beyond.\nThird, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We have loyal customers in the US, and they stay truly loyal in terms of frequency, transactions, and the level of customization they sought with their purchases. We are a brand known for the premium value we provide.\nOur one-of-a-kind experiential Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which elevate our brand and create lasting value, had strong transactions fueled by innovation across our coffee platforms, other beverages, and food. Throughout the quarter, brand perception of \"value for what I get\" on average remained strong, and our pricing decisions have been measured.\nBut in this environment, many customers are being more exacting about where and how they choose to spend their money, particularly with stimulus savings mostly spent. We saw this materialize over the quarter as customers made the trade-offs between food away-from-home and food at-home. Against that tide, we need to be able to reach and communicate with our customers in a way that demonstrates our value, particularly to Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app.\nWe are accelerating back-end work on the Starbucks app to ensure we better connect with our more occasional customers. Starting in May, we will add new and exclusive in-app offers that create additional value for our customers. We'll also launch upgrades to the app that include significant improvements to our wait time algorithms. Then in July, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all while making MOP available in more places outside our app.\nFollowing that milestone, more of our customers will be able to see our offers, including those that use guest checkout. More customers will discover the strong value we provide, value that they will not see otherwise. More on that later.\nThese opportunities show that much is within our control. We are confident in our accelerated plans to strengthen the execution engines that power how we serve our customers, how we create and amplify a pipeline of new products, and how we reach our customers through the Starbucks app. But let me be clear, it will take time to fully realize these opportunities. Our Triple Shot with Two Pumps Strategy is the way we will drive these plans forward over the long term. So let's talk about our progress made against each strategic pillar.\nOur first strategic pillar is to elevate the brand. We do this by driving compelling product innovation, building great stores, and operating great stores. Above all, we maintain our leadership and innovation in coffee.\nIn fact, just last week, we announced several steps to reinforce our leadership position through the lens of our partners, our customers, and our farmers. These include new investments in coffee farms to further scale open agronomy practices, new and exquisite whole bean coffees coming to our core and reserve stores, and new pop-up experiences in cities around the world to engage Gen Z and millennial customers in the craft of coffee, which they love.\nFurther, we are scaling the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer to deliver the world's finest hot quality brewed coffee. The Clover Vertica provides customers choice between six separate coffee roasts and blends, including decaf, brewed fresh on demand any time of the day. Its rollout is paired to the global launch of our new Starbucks Milano Duetto light and dark roast blends in stores later this year.\nAs mentioned, we're also driving more frequent and exciting product innovation, both coffee and non-coffee. Our team has been working with remarkable speed and agility to create a product innovation pipeline that includes new flavors, textures, and functional benefits. Investments in product development are already showing benefit. Our new Lavender platform performed nearly as well this past quarter as the PSL.\nMore recently, too, our new Spicy Refreshers and Reserve Hot Honey beverages show that relevant product innovation can exceed expectations. At our new Roastery and Reserve stores, we're now introducing new products with more agility and speed. Notably, we're also making strides to cut our average product development cycle in half from our current time table of 12-18 months. Looking to our innovation pipeline for the second half of the year, I'm excited by the number and types of products we're bringing to market.\nFor summer, we are launching our first texture innovation, Pearls. This is the first of more texture-based innovations that our customers can expect in the coming years. We're launching a new functional product, a zero-to-low calorie handcrafted energy beverage. Both build on our coffee heritage and open entirely new vectors for additional future innovation.\nLater this year, we will add up to five sugar-free customization options to our menu in response to both partner and customer requests. This will provide a lower-calorie option for approximately 80% of our beverages. Our product innovation pipeline will also include more plant-based options as well, like our new plant-based ready-to-drink Frappuccino beverage that recently launched in US grocery stores.\nBeyond our beverage development pipeline, we're also focused on enhancements to food. As an example of the investment we're making in food quality, we recently launched a reimagined premium blueberry muffin. For summer, we're launching a new Egg, Pesto & Mozzarella sandwich. It combines protein with outstanding taste. We're also expanding grab-and-go choices available in our store lobbies to include more vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options, as well as kid-friendly options.\nTaken together, our partner experience, unique customer experience, and our core products are what differentiates us. Our pipeline is significantly stronger than last year, and product builds are being developed with partners and simplicity in mind. We're also investing in our supply chain to lower cost and ensure products are available and in store for our customers.\nLastly, we continue to grow our global store footprint. Our store development capability is a core strength. This year, we will design and build more than 3,000 new stores globally, and we continue to do so in a financially accretive manner. Our new store openings continue to realize strong unit economics. AUVs and ROIs across our portfolio continue to drive strong returns and high incrementality. We're also leveraging learnings from international markets to meaningfully lower breakeven points for store formats scalable in emerging markets.\nMoving on, our second strategic pillar is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. As mentioned, Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app play a central role in driving value for our customers. Our MOP set another record in the US, representing 31% of all transactions in the quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards members in the US also grew by 6% over the prior year to nearly 33 million members. The stickiness and evolution of our digital position provides a structural advantage. Building on the strength, we are mapping additional ways to engage customers as we work to double SR members over the next five years.\nAs mentioned, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all in July. This addresses the current gap in our ability to reach non-Starbucks Rewards members, allows us to deliver more value for the occasional customers, and improves our ability to convert them to SR members. It drives a better experience for our customers and is core to our growth. We know that SR customers visit more often and spend more. Upgrades in our queue include a guest checkout feature and sequential improvements that make our App an even more appealing gateway for all customers.\nWe also plan to invest $600 million over the next three years to further digitize our stores and better target customers in more personalized ways. This includes the installation of digital menu boards across the footprint of all our company stores in the US and China.\nWe're making additional investments in our Deep Brew AI and machine learning platforms to further digitize and fine-tune how we operate our stores while delivering an improved digital customer experience and more personalized customer offers, offers that are timely, and relevant and flexible to location, inventory availability, and weather. These investments, including a new revenue management system, are foundational to successful execution.\nIn the near term, we continue to provide increasingly compelling offers, like marketed pairings, including both beverage and food, that make occasions like lunch even more appealing. We continue to encourage and reward routinized behaviors across the day with exclusive offers for SR members. To better communicate the value we provide, we are working to drive offer awareness with omnichannel marketing. This campaign will remind customers that the best offers are in the app and will target more occasional and non-SR customers.\nOur third strategic pillar is becoming truly global. Our International business remains an important part of our long-term growth strategy. Across the Middle East, we continue to work with the Alshaya Group to support the well-being of our partners and customers. Last month, the Starbucks Foundation and Alshaya Starbucks donated $3 million to the World Central Kitchen and their humanitarian efforts to provide food aid in Gaza.\nLast week, we also announced that every bag of whole bean Starbucks Odyssey Blend coffee sold at participating North American stores through June will benefit World Central Kitchen's efforts to address hunger around the world. Turning our attention to China, macro pressures resulted in traffic contraction this quarter. Performance was impacted by a decline in occasional customers, changing holiday patterns, a highly promotional environment, and a normalization of customer behaviors following last year's market reopening.\nLike the US, our decline in occasional customers was most noticeable in the afternoons and evenings. Still, there are many bright spots. Starbucks remains the Chinese consumer's first choice and away-from-home coffee across city tier, and age group. Our morning daypart in China registered growth fueled by coffee routines we've cultivated.\nMornings are now larger than before the pandemic. Delivery also achieved positive comp. Starbucks Rewards membership expanded, with active members now reaching a record 21 million. We're investing further to grow our SR members and their loyalty to drive greater engagement and lifetime value.\nBeverage innovation is also strong and validates the opportunity we see to further drive the strength of our product pipeline in China. Through the quarter, we unveiled 27 new products fueling brand excitement, and meaningful customer engagement. Monthly customer connection scores are at their highest ever, as is partner engagement.\nOur robust operating muscle led to sequential margin expansion amidst revenue headwinds. We sustained very healthy and profitable unit economics and a double-digit store operating margin for a total store portfolio, including new stores. While recovery will remain choppy, our business has shown great resilience, and our fundamentals are very strong. We will win and lead in the premium market. We have built a strong and expanding customer base, a strong brand, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores, and strong capability to drive margin expansion.\nWe continue to execute on the three key elements of our China strategy: offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations, making significant investments in technology to increase omnichannel capability and digitize our stores, and increase the percentage of new store openings in lower-tier markets and new county cities where we see stronger new store economics.\nWe will weather through this dynamic and transitory period as the industry shakeout continues. Our confidence in the market opportunity and our ability to deliver remains unwavering as we play the long game in China. Elsewhere, we saw growth in many parts of our International segment, highlighting the resilience and diversity of our business portfolio.\nExcluding China, our International segment grew revenue and comp in the quarter, bolstered by strength in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Japan. The Latin American region continued strong momentum with double-digit system sales growth. Our Asia Pacific region drove revenue growth despite headwinds in the Indonesian and Malaysian markets. Revenue from our Japan business grew by double digits.\nAcross our International segment, we opened 230 net new stores this quarter. In total, our store count outside of North America is now more than 20,800, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 9%. We opened our 400th store in India, our 600th store in Indonesia, and our 1,900th store in Korea. We are on track to operate 1,000 stores in India by 2028, translating to one new store opening every three days. As we expand to Honduras and Ecuador, our global footprint will grow to more than 39,000 stores across 88 markets, putting us well on the path to 55,000 stores by 2030.\nOur fourth strategic pillar, one of our Two Pumps, is unlocking efficiencies. In the quarter, our Triple Shot Strategy continued to unlock meaningful efficiencies across our North American business, driving 150 basis points of store operational efficiencies. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in product and distribution costs driven by supply chain improvements in procurement, transportation, and sourcing.\nSpecifically in our US stores, we're focused on creating a more stable environment for partners through investments in equipment innovation, process improvements, staffing, scheduling, and waste reduction, all things our partners value and prioritize, creating a more satisfying work environment in our stores while de-risking our business.\nToday, our stores are running better than ever before, underpinned by the strong fundamentals our team has built. For example, we see meaningful improvement in drive-through window times without adding more work for our partners. We have even more to come as we layer in our Siren Craft System. We are rebuilding and refining our supply chain. To unlock efficiencies in our factory in the back, we are leveraging technology in new ways. We have significant above-the-store opportunity to realize efficiencies in our supply chain. They are significantly higher than we initially thought, and we are ahead of plan and savings.\nThrough work to date, we have the confidence we need to extend our goal from $3 billion in added efficiencies over three years to $4 billion over the next four years. As a result of our investments and focused efficiency efforts, partner turnover reached a new low in the quarter. Store manager turnover has also improved, and both beat industry benchmarks by a wide margin. Average hours a partner continues to improve by double digits year-over-year, increasing engagement and their take-home pay.\nThat brings me to our fifth strategic pillar: reinvigorating our partner culture. From the beginning, Starbucks set itself apart as a different kind of company. Our unique culture is anchored in our Mission, promises, and values of craft, results, courage, belonging, and joy. At the heart of our business are our partners. They are central to the Starbucks experience and are delivering on our promise to uplift the everyday for customers around the world. I see this every day and through my regular work in stores.\nWe continue to work to restitch the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Just last week, we gathered together to celebrate our first-ever Starbucks Promises Day. Next month, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of our Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University. Following commencement, more than 13,000 partners will have earned their bachelor's degree through the program, bringing to life our partner promise of a bridge to a better future. What's more, over 25,000 partners across more than 90% of our US stores are currently enrolled in the program and are pursuing a bachelor's degree.\nTo close, we had a tough quarter. We need to do better, and we will. As I look forward, I'm confident we have the right strategy. We have terrific partners and a strong executive team that is deeply engaged and continues to lead. I thank each of our 460,000 green apron partners around the world for their remarkable work. We have real opportunity, and we are taking swift action to accelerate investments in the execution engines that will address the near term and drive our long-term success.\nThese actions are funded by our highly profitable operations, and productivity initiatives and are captured within our guidance. As these actions take hold, we expect our business to return to algorithmic growth and to achieve its long-term opportunity.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Rachel to discuss our results in greater detail. Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Laxman shared, our performance this quarter did not reflect what we're capable of as a company. We have an incredible brand, loyal customers globally, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores, and a connection with our partners and customers that's unlike any other in our industry. We know that we can, and we will do better. While it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance and recognized the onus is on us to execute. We've sharpened our focus, and with our comprehensive roadmap of well-thought-out actions, the path forward is clear. With that, let me turn to our results.\nOur Q2 consolidated revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year, due primarily to a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by lower transactions, partially offset by 8% net new company-operated store growth over the prior year.\nQ2 consolidated operating margin contracted 140 basis points from the prior year to 12.8%, primarily driven by deleverage, partner wages, and benefit investments, as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, which drove approximately 150 basis points savings in the quarter.\nQ2 EPS was down $0.68, down 7% from the prior year, primarily due to the contraction of operating income in both the North America and International segments as a result of lower revenue. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America revenue was $6.4 billion in Q2, flat to the prior year, as 5% net new company-operated store growth was mostly offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales driven by a 7% decrease in transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket.\nOur US company-operated business posted a 3% comparable store sales decline in Q2, driven by a 7% decrease in transactions. Consistent with Q1, the traffic decline was pronounced among more occasional customers with a more cautious consumer environment as a backdrop, and also included an estimated 3% adverse impact from extreme weather, including some store closures. Partially offsetting the decline was a 4% increase in average ticket, reflecting pricing as well as the continued mix shift into cold beverages such as Iced Shaken Espresso and Matcha Tea Lattes, which resonate with our customers.\nAdditionally, our new store performance remains strong, with both year-one AUV and cash margin of recently opened stores projected to be in line with last year's newly opened stores, preserving high incrementality even with our expanding footprint. North America's operating margin was 18% in Q2, contracting 120 basis points from the prior year.\nThe contraction was primarily driven by deleverage, partner wage and benefit investments, as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies. While deleverage drove the overall contraction in the segment's margin, efficiencies generated through our reinvention efforts meaningfully countered the deleverage we experienced in the quarter.\nWhile our reinvention plan is intended to provide a more balanced growth model and margin expansion, we're pleased to see the benefits counterbalance broader headwinds in our business as our partner staffing and scheduling investments continue to unlock in-store efficiencies. The benefits continue to expand outside of stores as well, resulting in meaningful reduction in the segment's product and distribution costs as a percentage of revenue, partially driven by supply chain savings.\nWe believe our strategies related to reinvention are working, creating more streamlined operations and tangible financial benefits across our business with more opportunity to come. Moving to International, the segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, roughly flat to the prior year, primarily as 12% growth in net new company-operated stores was offset by a 6% decline in comparable store sales, driven evenly by transactions and average ticket.\nRevenue was also impacted by a decrease in licensed store revenues, largely resulting from the negative impacts to our business in the Middle East. Although our revenue was impacted, our long-term aspirations in International have not wavered, as there was revenue and comp growth across the International segment when excluding China. This speaks to the strength of our broader International portfolio, driven by markets like Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean.\nShifting to China, in Q2, China's revenue declined 3%, driven by an 11% decrease in comparable store sales, consisting of 8% and 4% declines in average ticket and transactions, respectively, partially offset by a 14% net new store growth. The market continued to recover slower than expected, with further impacts from the timing of holiday-related travel trends.\nDespite the complex environment, the market opened 118 net new stores in the quarter, while sustaining double-digit store operating margin for both new stores and the total portfolio, demonstrating the health and resilience of our brand in the market, positioning us well in the market long-term. Total International segment operating margin was 13.3% in Q2, contracting 340 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by promotional activities, partner wage and benefit investments, as well as sales mix shift, partially offset by pricing in certain markets.\nShifting to Channel Development, the segment's revenue of $418 million in Q2 declined 13% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations, given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and SKU Optimization. Importantly, we maintained the number one share position in both US At-Home-Coffee and US Ready-to-Drink.\nAs an example of innovation in China, we launched our Starbucks Refreshers platform with two flavors, the Pink Drink and the Purple Drink, to drive our much-desired cold portfolio beyond our stores, particularly among Gen Z. The segment's operating margin was 51.7% in Q2, expanding 1,610 basis points from prior year, driven primarily by growth in our North America Coffee Partnership joint venture income, as well as lapping prior year impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets. The segment's operating margin is progressing in line with our original expectations, continuing to target the full-year range of high 40% to low 50% of a very attractive financial model.\nNow moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. Given what we shared today, we're revising our fiscal year guidance, and I'll walk through both one, what changed, and two, what remains the same in comparison to our previous guidance.\nSo first, what changed? Broadly, in Q2, our business underperformed, as revenues in the US, China, Middle East, and other markets were impacted more deeply than anticipated by the continued multifaceted headwinds. In addition to the Q2 performance, our exit rates of both revenue and comp growth across our key markets reflect continued headwinds.\nTo manage these headwinds, we have focused actions both to unlock capacity and attract demand in the spirit of uplifting traffic, as well as to further implement our Triple Shot Strategy. Leveraging our learnings from the Q2, and as Laxman discussed in detail, we're working to further elevate our brand through an integrated focus across product innovation and marketing, including strengthening our digital capabilities, delivering more value for our customers.\nFor instance, first, to unlock demand in the morning daypart in the US, we're working to improve store-related processes, leveraging our Siren Craft System while also increasing product availability through improved inventory management. Second, to attract demand, particularly in the afternoon day part, we're implementing a new and more frequent innovation cadence integrated with a broader multi-channel marketing approach, inclusive of highly targeted personalized offers. This shift is geared towards our more occasional customers to attract and direct them to our stores and app.\nNow, some of these actions will take time to fully materialize. However, through our investments in our customer experience and focused execution, we do expect to deliver some benefit in the current fiscal year. As a result of what has changed, our revenue and comp guidance, as well as the related flow through to margin and earnings, is impacted. In addition, the continued headwinds impacted our global store growth expectations.\nNow, before I share the details of our revised fiscal year 2024 guidance, I'll share what remains the same. First, we have confidence in the effectiveness of our proven Triple Shot Strategy, as our biggest opportunity lies in our execution.\nSecond, our efficiency efforts are tracking slightly ahead of our expectations. Year-to-date, we achieved 170 basis points of in-store operational efficiencies, along with great progress out of store, positioning us to deliver our $3 billion savings targets through fiscal year 2026, with line of sight to even more opportunity beyond that.\nThird, while our Channel Development segment is the smallest of our segments, it complements our portfolio, capturing customer occasions beyond our stores, and our performance in that segment continues to deliver.\nLastly, we must continue investing in the fundamentals and competitive moat of our business, our partners, our stores, and our customers, as we believe these investments will drive long-term growth and industry leadership beyond these transitory headwinds.\nBased on these facts, we are revising our full-year fiscal 2024 guidance to: Global revenue growth of low single digits from our previous range of 7%-10%; Global and US comp of low single digit decline to flat, both from the previous range of 4%-6% growth; China comp of single digit decline from the previous expectation of low single digit growth in Q2 through Q4; Global net new store growth of approximately 6% from our previous expectation of approximately 7%. We continue to expect our US store count to grow by approximately 4%, and now anticipate approximately 12% store growth in China from our previous expectation of approximately 13%. Operating margin growth approximately flat from the previous expectation of progressive expansion. Finally, we expect EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth of flat to low single digits from the previous range of 15%-20%.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. As an additional insight into our fiscal year 2024 guidance, we expect sequential revenue growth from Q3 to Q4, with pressure on margin and earnings easing in Q4 as our action plans take hold. We continue to expect our full-year effective tax rates in the mid-20% range. Lastly, we continue to expect approximately $3 billion in CapEx, most of which is ring-fenced for our direct investment in our global store portfolio, which, as we have shared, continues to drive highly attractive returns. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, Q2 was a challenging quarter for us as headwinds consistently persisted throughout the quarter, leading us to revamp our actions and response plan to both unlock and attract demand.\nSecond, our triple-shot strategy continues to deliver efficiencies even in the face of headwinds, reinforcing that we have the right strategy at the right time. Next, our fiscal year 2024 guidance has been revised to reflect our Q2 performance, year-to-date results, as well as the near-term headwinds we're experiencing. We, however, remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity and thus committed to our strategy and the related investments. Finally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude, reflecting shareholder commitment underpinned by our best-in-class dividend. This allows us to preserve both balance sheet durability and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate this complex and dynamic environment.\nBefore I open the call to Q&A, I want to share my sincerest gratitude for my partners, both in and out of stores across the globe, who show up every day living our values to deliver the differentiated customer experience that makes Starbucks so special for all of us. Thank you, partners. Operator, you can now open the call to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. With that, our first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please state your question.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, thanks. I guess it's a two-part question about trends that you were talking about.\nThe first is that you talked about weather as a headwind, and then you said that lavender latte in the quarter was one of the strongest launches you've had, similar to PSL. But your exit rate, it sounds like you're saying your exit rate was largely unchanged. So I'm trying to reconcile what would appear to have been headwinds that aren't recurring and then very successful innovation with the guidance and the exit rates. That's the first part. The second is just, in terms of the cautious consumer, typically, I think what we'd see is check management, and you don't seem to be seeing that. I think mix is still a tailwind for you. So it seems to me that there's not as much evidence of consumer caution as perhaps just some of what you were talking about that's Starbucks specific. So if you could just comment on those.\nThanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nSara, thank you for your question. Let me address both of them by pointing to the underlying pressures that we see consumers face just in terms of what they have available to spend. So there's no question that if you take some of these transitory headwinds out, which, of course, are not an excuse in any way, and you look at the underlying headwinds, particularly around the pressures that consumers face, particularly with the occasional customer, what we're seeing is that's where the challenge is. It's a challenge with their traffic, and it's their challenge with them coming into our stores. If you look at our most loyal customers, they're coming in often. They're seeing the value that we provide in Starbucks Rewards in our app. They are premiumizing to customization as in the past.\nTherefore, what you see there is you see a strong business with our loyal customers, particularly those within the environments of the Starbucks app. What we are focused on is, first, how we meet the demand we already have through ensuring that our partners have the processes and the tools at the peak in order to meet the demand of customers who at this moment are choosing not to complete their transactions in Mobile Order & Pay. The second thing is we are clearly launching new products, and our pipeline is very strong. What we are doing, though, as part of that, is the third element, is how we reach and deliver value to the more occasional customers as well as those that are not in the Starbucks Rewards ecosystem. That's where the challenge lies. That's how you reconcile the two points that you had made.\nSo we have a lot in our control, and we're focused on it. We're focusing on the execution of those three opportunities as I laid out in North America.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst and Executive Director of Restaurants and Food Distribution, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. When you talk about the more occasional customer, I'm curious: is that often a younger customer? And I think the broader question is just, is there any sort of brand resonance issue with perhaps some of that customer base? Do you think there's sort of a product resonance issue with them? Is there more that needs to be done than just kind of accelerating the pace of new products and some of the other drivers that you talked about in the near term?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nBrian, thank you for your question.\nI think that if you look at our overall brand equity, it is and continues to be strong. If you look at the scores around value for what I get, strong. So if I look at the occasional customer, though, they're clearly making choices based on the economic pressures they face. What they look for from us is they look for variety. They look for the core. 50% of what we have in the afternoon, as an example, is coffee. So obviously, coffee is really important, and distinctiveness of coffee is very important, but they are looking for variety, and they're looking for value. And what we're focused on is ensuring that we find a way to connect with them to bring them into our app ecosystem in order for them to see the value that we provide inside there.\nThat's why you're going to see the actions we take in May. You're going to see the actions that we take in July as we open up the app for all. That is going to make them, particularly in North America, be able to see the value that we provide in a way that's much easier for them. And as they build loyalty over time, they will see even more value as they come into the system. So that's as far as North America goes and the steps that we are taking.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nSenior Restaurant Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. A broader question on the global unit growth. Just more broadly, your confidence, or I guess the prudence in maintaining what still is outsized growth with the headwinds seemingly large.\nJust wondering how you can be confident that the current challenges you're facing aren't in part due to maybe saturation or cannibalization. I guess that does end up pointing to China. For China specifically, I think you mentioned healthy unit economics and double-digit restaurant margin. I was just wondering if, Rachel, maybe you could just talk about the specifics in terms of those sales margins and returns that justify still that outsized growth in a very challenging China macro. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks",
    "content2": "Let me first. I'll take on the first question of global unit growth and hand it over to Rachel to talk specifically about your question on China margins. Jeff, what we see is we see very strong cash-to-cash returns. I think what we've done both in the US, but also in the expansion plans that we have internationally.\nI think what you see is what we've focused on is ensuring that we have reduced the cost of our stores and stores investment. We have done a very good job in bringing efficiency to that. So as we expand, we see very good cash-to-cash returns. The reality is that the penetration we have in many of these markets and the headroom that we have internationally is very high. I mean, I think last time we talked about the fact that I think we were just in 800 cities in China. The opportunity for us in terms of counties is about over 3,000.\nSo I think we're not really penetrated as much as we could be in a place like China, which is why we have confidence as we look at the real estate options we have, the proposals that are coming together, and the kind of cash returns we get, which are very strong. That's what gives us confidence in terms of the global unit growth. Rachel, do you want to take the second part?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nAnd if I would just add to that, when we look at the guidance that was given around our new store growth, particularly as it relates to China, that's really a very deliberate decision that we took to be able to increase the number of stores that we were opening in lower-tier cities and new counties where we see even stronger returns.\nSo broadly, our returns are quite attractive, but they're even stronger in those lower-tier cities and the new counties. As a result of that, that shift actually impacts our development pipeline. So there's a timing impact in terms of new store growth. So that's why we're at 12%, which we think is still a very strong growth and indicative of the opportunity that we see.\n\nOperator\n\nAre you still connected? One moment. Can you hear us? One moment.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nWe can hear you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. First, I wanted to ask a clarification. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you viewed some of the issues in China as transitory. I think you were speaking more about the competition than you were about the consumer with that comment. I think you mentioned something about a shakeout.\nI was wondering if you could double-click on that for us, what you're maybe seeing that would make you think that the environment there would be competitively a transitory one and they would get better that way. And then from a beverage innovation standpoint, I'm wondering how you're viewing the pipeline. Lavender happened. Spicy lemonade has happened. You have two new ones coming up. How are you viewing the pipeline differently, and how are you thinking about the process of R&D differently today, and how are you evaluating what you've done? Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nI think we had some technical problems in hearing you, but let me just try and recap the question. The first question was on competition in China, and the comment around the shakeout that we are starting to see. And the second comment was on beverage pipeline.\nLet me start with the competition in China. I think the growth that's taking place in the mass area of the China business, of the China overall coffee and tea segment is one where we see just intense price competition. We're choosing not to participate in that. We are a premium brand. We've built a business over 25 years with a great deal of competitive advantages. You can see that there. We have amazing partners and stores. We have stores that look distinctive. We have an end-to-end supply chain that, frankly, I would love to have in the US. Then we are steeped in coffee and the tradition of coffee in end-to-end as well as with the knowledge that we have in stores. So we bring that to life very well in our business in China.\nAt the same time, what you are seeing is the intense competition, particularly in the tea segment, and it overlaps into coffee, in the mass area, is one where you are seeing some of the shakeout happen in terms of the impact on people and how they can really sustain that kind of intensity. For us, our focus is on the premium end. We're continuing to see that right now the headroom we have in China is large. I mean, we're still at 13 cups per capita. Japan is at 280, and the US is at 380. We know that over time, as the Chinese consumer starts spending, what you're going to realize is that we have a business that is healthy, that has a P&L at the store operating margin level that is strong.\nWe're going to see that grow as the consumer gets more and more exposed to coffee. So that is what I mean by the overall competitive environment in China. In terms of your question about the beverage pipeline, I think that's meant largely around North America. One of the things we're seeing here is we have a core in coffee, and we're tremendously excited about the innovations that we're bringing with whole bean coffee and some of the coffee-forward innovations that we are seeing in our stores. But additionally, as we look at the occasional customers, they are looking for variety. And what we are doing is we're finding ways to open up new platforms of growth. And last time, I mentioned that there were three platforms, and these are foundational for additional new introductions that we will make over time. The first one was textures.\nWe start with pearls with our Summer One program that starts next week. We then have a handcrafted energy platform that's coming in later on in this quarter. Additionally, plant-based is an area where we've traditionally been really well known for. We are defining platforms, and these are platforms around which you can expect to see systematic innovations that come in not just this time around, but also you will see, furthermore, that come in around these platforms. That's how we're thinking about R&D. It's around platforms, both in beverage as well as in food.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Sharon Zacfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nGroup Head of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'm trying to think through the sequencing of how we got here today.\nIt seems like in October and early November at the analyst meeting, demand was not a problem in the US. I hear you saying that you have a lot of unmet demand. But could you, excuse me, kind of help us do a hindsight on how these issues have come to a crux so quickly just four or five months hence since those kind of very ambitious goals that were given?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Sharon. I think that if I look at the headwinds that we see in the market, in particular with the consumer and the pressures that they face, I think that they were sharper and more accelerated than what we expected. I think in hindsight, if I look at the situation in China, while long-term growth potential is terrific and we're committed to the long term in China, the recovery has been choppy.\nBut I think what we've seen, particularly since that period, is we've seen more intense price competition than what we expected. None of that takes away from the long term, but it's clear that what we had this quarter was tough.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about the Siren System. This was the focal point of the Investor Day a couple of years ago, and it seemed like it was put on the back burner for a little while. But now it seems like you're talking more bullish about this system going forward. So can you just give us an update? I think last we heard it was going to be rolled out to less than 10% of the stores this year.\nWhat is the strategy now, and how does this help solve some of the issues you have? It sounds like some of the issues that you have are more in the supply chain and not necessarily within the four walls of the stores. Thanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nJust to respond to your question, first of all, the Siren System was never put on the back burner. In fact, we are on track to having a Siren System installed in less than 10% of the stores as much as we committed. So it's on track. What we've added in here, though, is the underlying processes to ensure that we can reduce the wait time in the store. It is inside the four walls of the store. That's what those processes are intended to do in the US. So that's what the acceleration of the processes are that we have been testing.\nWhat they provide is a base on which we will continue to implement the overall Siren Systems that we showcased to you in the September analyst day when you were here with us and we talked to it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nDirector and Restaurants Industry Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. One quick follow-up and then a question. First, can you just talk about the cadence of US comp throughout the quarter? I know you mentioned lavender was extremely successful, but it doesn't seem to be showing up in the comp just given the commentary on the exit rate. So just help us understand the performance of new products and whether that's driving incremental customers you're targeting. And then just a quick one on loyalty. It looks like active rewards members decline quarter-over-quarter, which is very rare.\nCan you just talk about what you're seeing there given the commentary on the strength of the core customer? Thank you very much.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nDo you want to take it on, Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Lauren. I'll start with the comp and what I spoke about in my prepared remarks about the exit rate. Lavender was quite successful for us, as you heard in Laxman's prepared remarks. What we were encouraged by is that lavender spoke to our customers, particularly our Gen Z and Millennial customers, as I'm asking about, which is more news, more often in a broader offering. Offering meaning coffee, non-coffee, food, and healthier choices. We hit squarely with that with lavender by having, particularly our most popular offering in lavender was the Iced Lavender Matcha Latte. That shows that when we innovate well, it meets our own expectations.\nNow, it was later in the quarter, so it did do something for us in terms of driving customers into the afternoon. Largely, we saw that platform resonate well in the afternoon with our customers. The lattes still tend to do more in the morning, but broadly, lavender hit in the afternoon. So we see that that overall offering and how we're trying to address the more occasional customer with that worked well. But what I would say is it was later in the quarter, we've got more opportunity coming going forward. And as a result of that, our exit rate in the quarter still reflected continued headwinds, which we're reflecting in our guidance for the back half of the year.\nBut we're expecting that the plans that we've outlined today will help to counterbalance some of those headwinds, particularly as we see those actions start to take place. So I think it's important to think about, there are continued headwinds in there. Our plans will counterbalance that. And as we go after some of those challenges, I think the other thing to remember is that we are coming with a position of strength as it relates to the efficiencies around our Triple Shot, as well as the growth we have in new stores and the strength we're seeing in our portfolio overall. We have a very strong profitable portfolio globally, which helps us, and our brand is strong.\nSo we look at all of that, and that's how we're thinking about the exit rates of comp as well as what we're seeing for comp for the back half of the year. So hopefully that provides a little more texture.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nBrady, on launching?\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nCEO, Starbucks International\n\nSure. Yeah. Thank you, Lauren. You talked about the year-over-year increase, but quarter-over-quarter decline of Starbucks Rewards members. And I think just to be clear, that is in terms of 90-day frequency. So we still have a very large population of SR members, but it's about the frequency of those customers. And so I think consistent with the consumer pullback, the more occasional, and very occasional SR members, those ones visited less frequently within the quarter. As a result of that, we saw fewer 90-day active quarter-over-quarter. That said, with a 6% growth year-over-year, we're continuing to grow SR. MOP grew in the quarter.\nSo we still have a very active customer base setting record highs for MOP. Delivery grew double digits in the quarter, so we see a very active digital customer. I think as Laxman talked about with regards to how we're going to drive SR and traffic in the coming quarters, this is squarely aligned to this challenge of reactivating SR members, bringing them back, and demonstrating value and driving frequency through the app and through SR. We have a lot of great programs lined up with the work we need to head to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. Two parts, if I may. I heard the word misinformation, and I think some improving maybe scores around that.\nSo I just wanted to get a sense of how much of an opportunity in terms of sales lost that you think correcting misinformation might actually mean for Starbucks. I don't think you've quantified that, but that would be helpful. And then secondly, regarding the Toyota Production System, I think I heard you said that it would help about a point. Correct me if I'm wrong about that, but that seems to be a fairly low number. And just talk about what kind of changes that would happen under the Toyota Production System. And to us, one of the opportunities would be having food ready when the customer orders it. In other words, using food warming cabinets would be particularly effective for both mobile order and pay, and drive-through. So is that something that maybe as part of Siren that can be accelerated before the entire Siren System goes into place?\nThank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nJohn, thank you for the question. I think on the question about misperception, misperception did have an impact on our business, and it's certainly other services. We don't have a quantification for that. But what we do know is that our brand equity is forward, and the investment we made in the brand has certainly helped strengthen the overall perception of our brand to the extent that we did. In terms of the Toyota Production System, what we're doing first is we're talking about how we deal with peak and dealing with deployment. So how we essentially work with deployment in the store, how we handle what happens with peak in terms of where people are deployed, how they essentially process customers, and what you see is a significant risk. I know we've given you a quantification of one percentage point.\nThat is a conservative estimate because when it fully gets deployed and it sticks, you would see even bigger improvements that happen. With regard to your question about the hot fold, that is purely something we're testing, and we're looking to accelerate. So it's a great point because we're looking to accelerate that with the work that we are doing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director and Restaurant Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. I know you're committed, of course, to the tenets of the reinvention plan, but in light of the current environment and caution of the US and China consumer, can you level set the long-term earnings algorithm introduced November around guidance for 5% same-store sales and 15%+ EPS growth? Does that still apply to 2025 and beyond?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nAndrew, thank you for your question. Everything we've seen, I know that we had a tough quarter, but everything we've seen in terms of the opportunities that lie ahead, as you look at the opportunities we have across the innovation that we see in terms of the pipeline going forward, not just there, but beyond. If you look at the productivity opportunities, the store count opportunities, and techniques, we believe we'll be back to algorithmic growth. And we see no change in the long-term algorithms we set earlier in this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Then the last question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. You may ask your question.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi. Good afternoon. My question's on the value strategy that you laid out and the need to protect traffic or attract traffic in a tough environment. But I'm just wondering how you balance that with protecting the long-term health of the brand. Starbucks has always been a very premium brand position, and sort of training some of these occasional users to come in on discount might have some detrimental impacts. So just wondering how you balance those two things and the strategy that you have.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you for your question. We have no intention of going across the board and discounting anything. What we are doing is we are certainly. The fact that as it goes on the chain, and as you know more and more we're talking to you in these different levels of incredible value. Remember that our brand overall right now, value for what I get is still very strong. So I feel very good about that. This is more about how we build the teams and how we attract customers, particularly those that don't create like that.\nWe need to find those groups that we have to find groups that have the lifecycle value of attracting them and bringing them into our app as well. That is what we intend to do.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. That was our last question. I'll now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you all for joining us. We are in a tough quarter, but we have a clear action plan. The management team and I are already providing a clear action plan, and we're doing it clean. That means that we can see a clear action plan, look at the shot, and think on strategy and action plan. Thank you all for joining us, and we appreciate the time you've taken this afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day."

I will start by sharing an overview of our business performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will then turn it over to Rachel Ruggeri to walk through the detailed segment results. We saw strong momentum and a highly successful holiday in the quarter with record revenue and expanded margins. We saw strong growth in our loyalty programs, sequentially increased in frequency and record spend among our loyal customers, positive traction from new product innovations, exciting momentum in China with our focus on premium, and progress on the execution of our triple shot strategy. We also saw some unexpected headwinds which impacted the rate of growth. We feel very confident about our robust plans to address these challenges.\nWhile we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter and it will take some time to normalize. Let me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year over year. Our global Comparable Store Sales grew 5% year over year, so supported by a 5% comp growth in North America driven by 4% ticket growth and 10% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8%, and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of a reinvention plan and the durable business we are building.\nWe are fortunate to have built one of the strongest brands in the world, and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically, in the US, we set new records with our 90-day Active Rewards members growing 13% year over year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59%, demonstrating increased engagement. Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially, and Spend per member reached a record in Q1 fueled by our holiday promotion, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our cold and Gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the US in the quarter.\nWe also had the highest sales of Starbucks gift cards in our history, making us number two in gift cards sold in total. We have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the US in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come.\nWe also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China. Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none based on our latest brand tracker. Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away from home coffee including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity, and purchase intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores with very strong customer connection and the highest retention rates in our industry. We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning day part that now has surpassed pre-COVID levels. Our loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often and our loyalty program is growing.\nWe're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio, across other physical channels, and through our digital connection, and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition of being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China.\nLet me now talk about the headwinds and our response.\nWe entered the first quarter very strong globally. We had great momentum in August and September, and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure. Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by three unexpected factors. First.\nWe saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remained loyal and in fact increased their frequency and spend in the quarter.\nBut we did see a softening of US traffic. Specifically, our occasional US customers who tend to visit in the afternoon came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower than expected recovery in China driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong Double 11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition.\nWe responded quickly to these headwinds. In the US, we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific Rewards members cohorts. Finally, we are leaning further into our brand marketing and factual narrative in social media to engage these audiences where they are. We've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives. With our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December, however, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers. We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized.\nIn China. We remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are three key elements in our China strategy. First, we are offering more coffee-forward, locally relevant product innovations, and we're increasing engagement in social media channels through influencers and partnerships, which are highly effective in China. These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omnichannel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions.\nThese investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores. Finally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized. That said, we remain confident in our triple shot strategy and our long term growth. So let me share some of the progress in the quarter.\nOur first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience. One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year.\nWe are a coffee company and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We are continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our US company-operated stores in the quarter. We are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our US company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in-store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry.\nWe also continue to offer coffee blends which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona Blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy. In celebration of our five years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast, inspired by the art and culture of Milan. Milan's MiArt, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture our love of coffee, the passion of our partners, and the dynamism of Milan.\nToday we are excited to launch the Oleato platform with Oleato customizations across the US in the coming weeks. We will also launch a Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Crème Frappuccino and a Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie Cold Brew in time for Valentine's Day. Starting this week and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing three new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and Millennial customers across a range of coffee and cold beverages, and compelling for the afternoon. These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience.\nWe're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January we added new menu items including the Potato, Cheddar, and Chive Bakes and the Chicken, Maple Butter, and Egg Sandwich. These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand.\nWe're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics. Our most recent age class of company-operated new stores in the US is averaging unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%, and as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the US on a base of over 16,000 including licensed stores. We will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-thrus which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year. Even in the US we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead.\nOur second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our Mobile Order and Pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter, and we reduced downtime of Mobile Order and Pay by half. As we continue to find ways to deliver a better customer experience, we're continuing to make the Starbucks App even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup, ordering through the app, and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want. One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs.\nWe saw record results in our US delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year over year aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity. Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with GoPuff targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5:00PM and 5:00AM. In this pilot, Starbucks-trained baristas prepare handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside GoPuff micro-fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes. To further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks Connect in over 40% of our more than 6,700 US licensed stores with further expansion planned for this year.\nWe're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds on the great success of our partnership at Delta Air Lines that has deepened connection and engagement with our members and is one of two new Starbucks Rewards partnerships. We told you we would roll out this year.\nOur third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term. If you look at our business excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year over year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the US. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead.\nLet me address our business in the Middle East. I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate, and weaponized speech. We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region, and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers.\nI shared earlier my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remains strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior year mobility restrictions.\nAs we strengthened our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments in the quarter. We launched 12 new coffee-forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning day part, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels. Our digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter over quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards Gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter, with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers.\nOur new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability with further strength in unit economics in stores opened in new county cities, and our turnover among full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score.\nEarly this month we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China with nearly 7,000 stores. We have built a durable business, we have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000 store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity. We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space. Even as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our international segment. As part of elevating our brand across the international segment, along with a second Reserve store in India, we will open two additional Starbucks Roasteries that celebrate coffee, art, and design in markets outside the US and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course.\nTurning to our fourth priority, we focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress. Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points margin expansion in Q1 of the Philippines fiscal year. As you've heard me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers. We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business through a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency in the quarter. We have seen the effectiveness of the reinvention driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies such as standards, equipment innovation, and scheduling improvements leading to a more stable environment for our partners. Turnover has decreased by 5% year-over-year and is now well below pre-COVID levels.\nAverage partner hours increased 10%, leading to a 14 percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners. We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made today. Outside of our stores, we are working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress, and we remain on track to unlock $3 billion in efficiencies over the next three years.\nOur final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and board of directors has been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on-the-ground support, a dedicated labor relations team, and more bespoke management training are having a tangible impact on the commitments we've made to our partners. The assessment was also clear that there has been no union busting playbook at Starbucks.\nI want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners and in the 4% of our stores in the US where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union. We are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks, their futures. Our partners remain core to the success of our business and I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners.\nGoing forward. We plan to continue to focus deeply on reinvigorating our partner culture. It's a priority for me and I'll continue spending time each month working up close shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores. I did this during my visit to India earlier this month and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business. Good and not so good. I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master Black Apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks. As we look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I have great optimism. We have a strong strategy. Our refreshed mission, values, and promises are underpinning everything we do.\nWe have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business while delivering strong shareholder returns. Finally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand firm for belonging. We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world and with that, Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter. Despite the top-line headwinds we experienced, our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies, driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business, and this quarter proved testament to that durability.\nOur Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year, even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business. As Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call, the revenue increase was driven by 5% Comparable Store Sales growth, 8% net new company-operated store growth, as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution. Q1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment.\nQ1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year. Our strong double digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide Segment Highlights for Q1.\nNorth America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 with $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket, and transactions respectively, as well as net new company operated growth of 4% over the prior year. Our US licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program.\nOur US company-operated business delivered 5% Comparable Store Sales growth in Q1 driven by 4% ticket growth from pricing, mix, and customization. This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus-year history as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Lattes and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish, resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December in light of the pressured traffic and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member.\nNorth America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year driven by 240 basis points from reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies as well as sales leverage, and pricing partially offset by continued investment in our partnership. This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor, staffing, and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners' preferred shifts which enhanced both our partners' experience and subsequent store performance.\nWe saw store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest level in Q1 outside of stores. We reaped the benefits of enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in Q1 as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion.\nMoving to International, the segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year-over-year as well as a 7% increase in Comparable Store Sales driven by 11% transaction growth partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East pressured our International segment as a whole. However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment.\nIn Q1, China's revenue grew 20% driven by 15% new store growth as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth largely related to the market lapping prior year COVID impact. Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered. Total international segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year, and strategic investments partially offset by sales leverage.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee. Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the number one share position in both US at-home coffee and US Ready-to-Drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year driven by product costs and global coffee alliance partially offset by business mix shift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin.\nNow moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024, we are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin, and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results as well as account for recent trends including a softer than planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance. With that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%.\nFull year global and US comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q3, Q2 through Q4, with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full year basis. Full year EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter. As an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency in terms of quarterly shape.\nWe expect growth rates for our global revenue comps operating margin as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year. While we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rates of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete non-recurring tax items. Finally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record $2.4 billion.\nOur strong cash generation together with our leverage and investment grade rating creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize but remain confident in our long term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength.\nBefore I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come. So thank you, partners. With that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Rachel. Before we open the call to Q and A, we request that your questions today be focused on the quarterly performance that we just discussed, as this call is not to address questions related to recent proxy filings. With that, Diego, let's take the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow up questions as time allows. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q and A roster.\nYour first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just a question on the fiscal 2024 guidance. Appreciate that you tempered the comp growth for both the US and China. For the US, it looks like it's only a point, and China, it's only a few points. But we would define that, I guess, as modestly. And yet you mentioned that fiscal Q2 is expected well below the targets before accelerating the rest of the year. So with that as a backdrop, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about, I think you mentioned January has been softer than expected. Any color you could provide there. And otherwise, your confidence in that new guidance, it does seem like it implies a rather sharp acceleration in the back half of the year.\nI'm just wondering how you think about the guidance relative to maybe tempering it further and not having that risk if perhaps the recovery doesn't play out as fast as you might be expecting? Thank you.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. Yeah. Thank you, Jeffrey. This is Rachel. As it relates to our guidance, when we look at our revised revenue guidance, it's based on the performance we saw in Q1 as well as the near-term and transitory headwinds that we've spoken about. With that, we expect Q2 will be below the full year guidance ranges, largely due to the fact it's going to take some time for our plans to materialize, as well as we'll continue to see impacts to our business in the Middle East. But what gives us confidence in that revenue range is the fact that we still have a very strong and growing loyal customer base. We're having increased capability as it relates to our digital programs around the world. And we've also seen that our reinvention has expanded, been very successful in helping us to meet increasing demand.\nMost specifically in this quarter, we saw really strong demand supported in our morning day part, our busiest day part in our US business. We actually exceeded both prior year, the year before. We're very in line with pre-COVID levels. So we're encouraged by that overall just in terms of transactions. In addition to that, as we talked about in the call, you know, we're confident that we have multiple levers to be able to drive our earnings growth. Revenue growth is one factor, and we believe we've got growth in that guidance range that will help drive margin expansion through flow through. But in addition to that, we have in-store and out-of-store efficiencies that we're seeing great success with.\nAnd so that gives us some confidence that we have, you know, a balanced path and multiple levers to be able to drive that earnings growth of 15% to 20% on a full year basis.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Could you talk more about kind of the specific plans to drive sort of the occasional customer? It sounds like you would expect some pretty solid improvement in US sales as we go through the year. It sounds like what was new was some new product platforms. Could you just elaborate on how quickly you think those will work? What might be coming on the product side that drives your confidence in US sales?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure, let me start and I'll call on Brady a bit to provide some more color.\nAs we said earlier, what we saw in the US was a quarter that was actually very strong until about the middle of November. And what you see in the results, very strong performance of the loyal customers, very strong holiday performance, very strong brand equity, and very strong performance on gift card sales. And we mentioned as well that we've got about $3.6 billion loaded on our card. So manifestation of the overall brand being very strong. And so there is of course what we do have the isolated impact with the occasional customers, particularly those with that visit in the afternoon. So if you look at some of the actions that we have in place.\nFirst, there is actually more demand than we're currently meeting in the US. Second, our loyalty program is already performing exceptionally well, as Rachel mentioned. But we have a combination of things that we're doing to address the traffic slowdown, particularly in the afternoon. The first area is innovation. We mentioned a couple of new products coming in time for Valentine's Day. But we're going to have three new beverage platforms coming in the next six months, and you will see how important that is for us over time. The second action is really we're opening up our app ecosystem to bring more people into the app because we know that our members developed a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both traffic and transactions. And third, we are implementing targeted offers aimed at some of these very occasional customers to bring them back into the stores.\nAnd all that of course is foundational to we continue to execute in our stores in order to elevate partner pride, bring a great deal of passion back into the business, and ensure that we can meet more of the demand that we know exists. Brady, do you want to give a bit more flavor around some of the activations, particularly on the innovation side?\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nEVP and CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Laxman. As Laxman said, there's a calendar of compelling product innovation. Laxman spoke about the new beverage platforms that are coming over the next few months. On food, we're seeing a lot of momentum on this health-conscious all-day breakfast and all-day snacking that I spoke about on the investor day. As we've released new products in that space, we've seen great resonance with customers, and we'll continue to mine that space. Then we look at digital.\nLaxman referenced the 30% of US transactions coming through MOP. We're seeing high demand for that service even among occasional customers. So increasing the reach of the app. Number one, increasing personalized communication in the app both to drive ticket for those routinized customers but also frequency for the less frequent customers is a capability that we continue to build. We talk a lot about our personalization capabilities at Starbucks, but truly that job is never done because as new technologies and capabilities come online, we are grabbing those and integrating them into our system to use that as a business accelerator.\nAnd then, lastly, I'd say just making Starbucks more accessible, expanding, as you heard from Laxman, the delivery options you have with Starbucks in a very fast-growing part of our business, and then looking at ways to capture more Starbucks Rewards members who are currently not members through big partnerships like the one we've just announced with Bank of America. So between compelling products, really accelerating SR member acquisition efforts, and then building our brand, as Laxman said, to address the fact-based narrative in social media and win our customers and win every visit back. That's where we're focused.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director of Restaurants, BTIG\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about the check dynamics going on in China. It looks like down, call it 9%. That's a pretty steep decline. Just talk about the promotional environment that you're seeing there and what exactly you guys are doing to combat that. And just more specifically, should we expect this check impact to really continue for the balance of the year or how do we think about that going forward? Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nWell, we have Belinda online here, so maybe I'll turn this over to Belinda. Do you want to answer that question, please?\n\nBelinda Wong\n\nChairwoman and Co-CEO, Starbucks China\n\nOkay, thank you for the question. Let me just address the AT decline first. The average ticket decline. First of all, our beverage and food sales were strong and contributed majority of our comp growth in Q1 and our AT decline. The 9% decline mainly came from two areas. One is slower sales of our higher-priced merchandise as our consumers now more cautious in their spending. But the merchandise category constitutes a relatively small portion of our sales mix. Second, it's the targeted promotional investments that we are making to personalize offers and reward customers behaviors in order to drive trial and frequency. Now this enabled us to optimize our sales and margin. And this is powered by our Deep Brew that helps us to design the right offers to the right cohorts of customers at the right time. So that's mainly the reasons for decline.\nAnd you asked about the promotional environment.\nLet me just say this. The coffee market is evolving as Laxman said and going through a transition. It's still early days, and it has not yet fully tiered. Right. You see mass influx of mass market competitors, focus on fast store expansion, and low price tactics to drive trial. This will shake out over time. Yes, we're operating under an increased promotional environment. We're not interested in entering the price war. We're focusing on capturing high quality but profitable sustainable growth. Okay. It is our aim to be the best and lead in the premium market as Laxman has said, which Starbucks has pioneered in China 25 years ago. We will continue to focus on premium experience that is high quality coffee and human connection. We have clear strategies to fuel our comp and total growth.\nAs Lax shared the three points, the three strategies, I'll add a little bit more colors.\nWe're going to dial up our beverage.\nFood innovation with robust marketing activations on social media and in-store. We're going to accelerate our personalization efforts to drive innovation, sales, and productivity. We're going to continue our new store expansion infill in existing cities, accelerate new country city entry, dial up our omnichannel expansion, scale up our membership program, and continue to invest in our partners. So we have all these strategies to drive our Comp growth and total growth in traffic and ticket. So we are very confident in our ability to deliver our growth in the short and long term. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much. I want to ask about the US business and appreciate all the color, I guess. Two related questions. One, I understand you're seeing a more significant slowdown with the occasional customer. Have you also seen a slowdown in traffic with rewards customers, or are the challenges really just isolated to occasional, trying to understand some of the breadth of the social media challenges? And then second, you ramped up the level of promotional activities for rewards. Is this effectively hitting the occasional customer? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about promotional activity ahead. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nWell, let me take this on. First of all, we have seen no slowdown in our loyal SR customers. In fact, we're seeing an increase in frequency. They're buying more, they're customizing more. That part of the business is extremely strong. We did see, as you rightfully said, a slowdown in the very occasional customers, which we're still working to get back. But the folks in the middle who were, you know, occasional, some of the tactics that we use, which of course you're seeing, essentially help bring them back into the fray. In terms of the traffic, we've seen it bounce back towards December. So we're focused on ensuring that we do the right thing in terms of welcoming back our very occasional customers with the right offer, with the right innovation, and with the right experience in stores.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & co.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer & Co\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking the question, Rachel. I wanted to ask about the operating margin expansion in the Americas segment. Obviously, it was very impressive in Q1 and it was driven by leverage on your store operating expense line. In fact, when we break it down on a dollar basis, on a same store basis, those operating expenses were actually flattish or even slightly down, year over year. Can you just unpack what's going on in that line item? How sustainable is this performance on the operating expense line?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. As you look at the store operating expense, you know, it's largely driven by the activities we've taken around our reinvention in in-store operational efficiencies. So that's a combination of a number of factors, including we've focused on operational execution, leveraging standards to be able to manage performance across, you know, over 9,700 stores and growing. So that's been one driver. In addition to that, we've had continued improvement in our equipment and the investments we made in equipment a year ago, as well as the investments we're currently making. That's all annualizing and helping to support the favorability that we're seeing in the margin expansion. And then third is more recently we focused on improving our overall scheduling. So providing more hours for our partners per store. We have a ways to go, but we know that that's a high driver of engagement.\nAll of those efforts together have led to lower turnover and a more stable environment. And it's that stability that really allows us to create a better efficiency in serving our customers. So as an example, I already spoke about our morning day part. This quarter in the US was the strongest that we've seen. And that's a function of all of those efforts and activities that I just spoke about being realized in supporting our demand. So creating a better experience for our partners and leads to the better experience for our customers. Now, some of that was annualization from the efforts that we made last year, but we continue to see quite a bit of opportunity ahead.\nWhen we think about continuing to focus on scheduling, continual focus on improvements in staffing, we have more work ahead of us there as well as in-store or, excuse me, out-of-store efficiencies. The way we scrutinize our sourcing, the way we distribute to our stores, we've seen some benefits from that this quarter that won't show up in store operating expense, that will be in our product and distribution cost. But between those two lines, that's where we see potential opportunity going forward. So it gives us confidence in the progressive margin expansion, but importantly our ability to continue to meet that 15% to 20% earnings growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nRestaurant and Food Analyst, Evercore",
    "content2": "Hi.\nA big picture question. I don't know if this is maybe one for Brady, but by our math, just looking back to 2016, just because you gave some percentages on what was cold and what was hot of your beverages, it looks like your US cold beverage sales have grown by roughly $750,000 per store while hot beverage sales have declined by $150,000 per store. Since pre-COVID, your rewards membership has more than doubled. But traffic is down since that time, so. And we don't see your customer like you do. This is a bit of a question, but it looks like you maybe have less of that everyday hot coffee and latte consumer and more of a new type of consumer that comes less frequently and probably has options for cold beverage.\nI'm envisioning them being, you know, my daughter and three of her friends coming in some afternoon. So it's more of an episodic visit, big orders, cold beverage led. So with this happening, if this is what's happening, how does that inform your strategy for growth going forward? I know you're doing some things to increase capacity on cold beverage and maybe that helps fuel the summer months a little bit more, but I'm just wondering, do you share that perspective and how does that fuel your strategy? Thank you.\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nEVP and CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, David. It's a great question. My perspective is a little different in that we don't see a trade off in frequency between cold beverage customers and hot beverage customers.\nIt's really a shift in generational taste preferences where that highly frequent millennial Gen Z customer is drinking cold coffee every day, just as people of different generations were drinking hot coffee to start their day every day. So, we've seen a continued increase in our cold beverage in our portfolio, as you noted. But what I found with the cold beverages is there are infinite customizations possible on the cold beverage platform, and what that means is that it's increasingly a beverage you can't get anywhere else, and so it has a staying power to it. So we don't see a trade off in frequency from hot to cold. Cold is a great business for us, and we don't see a threat there. We see a great opportunity.\nYou mentioned about the capacity that we can put in place with Siren systems and other aspects of the things we're doing in reinvention, which is really about accelerating our capacity to create and craft cold beverages at pace with our customers, both in drive thru, mobile order, and delivery in particular. So that is a huge opportunity for the company. And on hot beverage, I would say we're not leaving that customer behind. We're continuing to innovate on hot beverages, just as we did today with the launch of our Oleato beverages. We're launching Clover Vertica store across our portfolio. We're in 10% of stores now, and that is the best cup of brewed coffee you've ever been able to get at Starbucks, rolling out on a proprietary machine.\nAnd then lastly, you mentioned or Lax mentioned our Milano Roast, which is really our passion for coffee coming to fruition. So whether you're a cold coffee customer or a hot coffee customer, we're increasingly creating a reason for you to visit and we see no trade-off there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much. I just wanted to ask about unit growth. I know in both the US and China, you mentioned.\nThe most recent vintage has high volumes and strong ROIs in the US, but I was curious if you are seeing anything that might suggest that the acceleration in unit growth may be translating into slower same store transaction growth? I know this is a very kind of idiosyncratic quarter, but in the past I think when we have seen faster growth it has sometimes corresponded with slower same store transactions. I wanted to see if you had any color on any variation in markets or infill versus greenfield and then if you could just maybe address that same question.\nChina.\nThank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nRachel, do you want to take on the US? And Belinda, I'd love you to take on China. Sure.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThanks, Sara, for the question. In the US, what we see is we continue to see that our unit volumes, as we shared in Laxman's prepared remarks, are continuing to grow. And, importantly, when you look at the growth in North America and in the US business this quarter, our revenue grew 9%. So you've got a 5% comp in there. And we've already spoken to, though we were pleased with the performance and the strength we saw particularly in our most loyal customers. We talked about some of the headwinds that related to some of the impact we saw there. But when you look broadly, and you look at the combination of comp and new store growth driving to that 9%, it shows you that we still have a lot of, I'd call it, opportunity even in the US in terms of continuing to open more new stores.\nWhen we do it through purpose design, we're able to look at the market and determine how do we drive the overall trade area higher with a variety of different types of stores to meet customers where they are. So we see a lot of opportunity there. With that I'll turn it over to you, Sara.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nCan I just add one thing here? We've gone through a look MSA by MSA, and what is interesting is as you start looking at where the population has shifted and you look at how the US is so different from what it was even five years ago, I think what you see is white space for us, and particularly as you look at purpose defined stores and our plans to build in the US, we have a lot more headroom in the US with that. Let me call on Belinda to talk a little bit on China, both around how our business has been reset, but also the kind of growth options we see. Belinda, go ahead.\n\nBelinda Wong\n\nChairwoman and Co-CEO, Starbucks China\n\nThank you. So despite the short-term headwinds, the long-term opportunity in China is clear. I think everyone will agree to that. So I talked extensively at the investor forum about the huge greenfield opportunities to both increase penetration in existing cities and entering new county cities. So as of Q1 we are only in 857 cities out of nearly 3,000 in China. The opportunities are abundant, and new stores continue to deliver best-in-class store profitability and returns. And when you look at new county city stores that we have entered recently and in the past couple years, it consistently outperform top-tier cities, new stores and profitability too. So as Laxman has pointed to, we will accelerate our entry into new county cities so we are on track to reach 9,000 stores. So many opportunities out there.\nWe will.\nWe have a very sophisticated system visualized and to help our team to identify the right areas to open to optimize the cannibalization impact and where we should be going. So with our experience, our team, our operating muscle, and track record, I have full confidence in our store expansion plan and we're on target to achieving 13% store growth in FY2024.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nI've been to China three times the last nine months, and one of the things that's fundamentally impressed me with the business is really how used COVID and the time that the business has actually taken to reset the business. If you look at the end-to-end costs from a supply chain perspective with the digitization, what is happening end-to-end in China, it is frankly incredibly strong. I'd love to have some of that back in the US. If I look at the ability to deliver the value that we have end-to-end in China, coupled with the premium experience with the wonderful stores we design at a very low investment cost because that has also been fine-tuned. What you realize is that as we expand, the kind of economics we're seeing are very strong.\nAnd so I think that is foundational to what Belinda talked about, big headroom in terms of cities to go to. But also what I compliment the team on is the work that has gone into build a business end-to-end that is extremely strong. This doesn't happen overnight. This happens because of 25 years of history and the muscle and the capability that the business has built in China. The team is ready. Obviously, as the market turns and we see things come back, you're going to see the kind of economics get even better.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thank you. Rachel, how did you arrive at the new low single digit China same store sales guidance from the 4% to 6% previously? Perhaps you can help us understand the typical quarter to quarter changes in seasonal AWS that you typically see in China and how that factors into the new 2024 guidance. Thanks.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. Thank you, Andrew. When we looked at the guidance for China, it's largely based around, I wouldn't say, the seasonality is maybe as distinct as what we see in the US business with Q2 being so much lower than any of our other quarters and strengthening as we go through Q3, Q4, particularly because we're lapping quite a bit of.\nComps from the prior year. If you recall, last year in Q3 we were lapping the COVID impacts from the prior year. So we have a pretty big lap when you look at that comp and that comp in Q3. So it's more around the progression we expect in the business, less about the comp or about seasonality, and more about the progression in the business. And you know, what we're looking to is Chinese New Year, as an example, is a good indicator of what we expect to see around the consumer environment, and that's factored into our assumptions. So a lot of it depends on mainly the recovery, the time it's going to take. As Belinda and team work on the action plans, which are in some ways, I'd say, adapted to what we're saying.\nWe've already led in the premium market, but we're adapting some of our strategies as it relates to the awareness of the customer and how we go after the customer through the innovation and new channels of social media. So we expect that that's going to take some time, and that's reflected in the guidance range. But I would think about it that way: it is more about the recovery and the progression from where we are with the plans today, which we're expecting we'll see a rebound and closer to a stabilization in the back half of the year.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nI think it's fair to say that the Chinese consumer is very cautious, and so the recovery is going to be choppy. But as Rachel has said, we think we factored that into the guidance that we see. The long term opportunity in China is tremendous.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nHead of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nHi, good afternoon.\nOn the customer that lapsed in the.\nQ1, was there any particular demographic?\nThat you saw more of an impact with?\nExcuse me. Then on the conversation around the.\nNew beverage platforms, I think you said?\nThree upcoming new beverage platforms.\nCan you talk about the potential trade?\nHow's the speed there as you talk about untapped demand?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSo, I think what I heard you say was, were there any demographic, specific demographics that it impacted, and the second question was on the three beverage platforms. Is there something that is a trade-off between speed? Is that correct? We couldn't hear you properly. Actually, maybe you could repeat that question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nHead of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nI think my phone's breaking up.\nWhen I think about you introducing new.\nBeverage platforms and introducing complexity potentially into.\nThe system, I naturally worry about throughputs.\nAnd you talk about untapped demand and the opportunity to tap into that as part of the buffer into the back half of the year. And I'm just thinking about that with.\nThe new beverage platforms and hoping you.\nCan talk about if there is a trade off with speed or if the.\nNew beverage platforms have been designed to help facilitate throughput.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nBrady, do you want to take it off?\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nEVP and CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. So in terms of beverage platforms specifically, I'll start there. We put every product we offer through a very rigorous set of tests and measures to make sure that it's conducive to operations, that it's easier for our partners to deliver in the stores, and make sure that it's accretive to the business. A lot of times what we'll do is we'll bring in a new product and we'll take a lower volume product out just to maintain the total complexity of the system rather than just add, add, add. We have a very disciplined approach about how we do that. And so the three beverage platforms which we won't reveal yet.\nHave gone through that. It's really about how to do these products in a way that's accretive to the business and specifically targeted. In these cases, this is about looking at that occasional customer, and frequent customer, but particularly appealing for the afternoon where we want to continue to build our business. We've really laser targeted these products for those occasions, and we're excited to bring those to customers. With regards to the demographics, Starbucks attracts a very wide range of customers around the world and particularly in the US, again, a very wide range of customers. The way I would characterize it is occasional. I know we've spoken about the very occasional. That's really what we would say is the audience with whom we saw that impact in November and started rebounding in December.\nThat's where I would leave it and say we've got plans to bring them back.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Strelczyk with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nAndrew Strelzik\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just make sure that we understand the bridge from the revised or lowered revenue growth guide to the maintained EPS growth guidance. Obviously, the first quarter operating margin was very strong, particularly in North America. So is something changing there in your expectations for the year? The cost saves coming through faster or greater? Is there a change in how you're thinking about buyback contribution there? Just any more texture on that bridge would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nSure. Thank you for the question as it relates to our guidance and how we're thinking about maintaining the earnings growth range of 15% to 20%, though our revenue has been revised. I think what's important to think about that is what we're pointing to is that Q2 will be below our full year guidance ranges on all of our metrics. And then we'll expect to see a rebound and a stabilization in the back half of the year. And that rebound and stabilization will come to from the revenue growth that we're guiding to, so the 7% to 10%. And in that revenue growth range there is.\nTime to materialize. There is the impact we have from a strong and growing loyal customer base, as well as what we've talked to around the strength in digital and some of the success we're seeing in reinvention. So that's factored in there to give us the confidence to be able to expect that we'll see the flow through from the revenue growth in the back half of the year. But in addition to that, what we're expecting is that we'll continue to see the strength in our in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies. So we had good success this quarter. We'll expect some of that to continue into Q2, and it'll further into Q3 and Q4. That's how we'll be able to drive to the 15% to 20% on a full year basis.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The last question comes from John Ivanko with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.\n\nJohn Ivanko\n\nResearch Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi.\nThank you. It's maybe a related one to the previous, but normally operating companies when they do reduce revenue, it's pretty customary for earnings to come down along with that. Now you guys have communicated, I think $3 billion of cost savings on a three-year basis. I think that's $1 billion on a gross basis on a one-year basis. Can you talk about if there were any cost savings that were pulled forward into fiscal 2024? Were there any meaningful expenses, maybe discretionary expenses in 2024 that were perhaps pushed out, you know, into 2025 and 2026? And maybe I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself at this point or getting ahead of you at this point. You know, as we kind of think about you getting more margin on that lower revenue than maybe we would have thought earlier.\nDoes it actually lead to a more difficult comparison that you'll have to face? 2025 over 2024. Is there just some shifts in expenses between the two years?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThe way I would look at it, John, is as we showed in Q1, we were able to demonstrate that margin expansion of 130 basis points at the total company level given a combination of sales leverage. So we still had strong sales growth. Right. That sales leverage as well as the flow through from that sales leverage and the in-store operational efficiencies that we spoke to. And when we think about the back half of the year, we'll expect to continue to see benefit from the revenue growth and the sales leverage that comes from that. But we'll also see benefit from the in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies which we do have ability to increase our focus on some of those areas which will help to ensure our 15% to 20% earnings growth commitment on a full year basis.\nOutside of that, we also have investments as it relates to G and A investments as it relates to our reinvention. We'll continue to make the investments because those investments drive a meaningful impact and they're a driver of our competitive advantage. But we do have an ability to also dial up and dial down some of those investments to help support the commitments we're making as it relates to the years ahead. I don't think it's probably best to just focus on the year we're in right now. But that's how I would expect.\nThe guidance to come together and how I'd think about Q2 relative to the balance of the year.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nJohn, if I could just add one more thing. I think we've systematized our approach to how we think about innovation, how we think about productivity, how we think about growth more overall. It's a very sort of systematic approach that we have in place of pipelines around how we're looking at different things, so we have visibility clearly in terms of things that we could do, for example, about the store. And they go multiple years. And so even if we did bring something forward because we can, it does not at all mean that we don't have more that we go after. So I feel very confident about that, that we'll continue to invest in the business. There's no impact from a buyback. I think that was a question asked earlier, none whatsoever. And we're investing in the business.\nBut we also know that we have opportunities for us to make ourselves more efficient. At the same time, get the throughput that we think we need in order to meet the demand that exists out there.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nYeah, I do think it's just worth noting is that our buybacks are expected to be nearly 1% of our earnings growth net of interest, so small in the scheme of things.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you so much, Diego. I will close by reiterating our strong momentum from the quarter and our overall confidence in our long term growth. While we continue to navigate some headwinds, we're encouraged by the strength of our brand, particularly with our loyal customers around the world and the plans that we have in place to address the challenges we have identified on a broader level. I've come to learn that we truly are a different kind of company here at Starbucks, but we are now operating in a different kind of world. We recognize that no one can solve the many difficult problems in the world alone. Starbucks is, however, and will continue to be the world's third place, providing people with places to come together, to connect, to find common ground, to feel they belong, and to bring a little joy in their everyday.\nThank you for joining us this afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Starbucks' first quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call. You may now disconnect."

I've learned through connecting with so many of you how our reinvention plan has continued to be well executed, giving us great momentum in this age of our transformation at Starbucks. I have discovered how our brand is uniquely delivered in our stores and digitally through our extraordinary partners and the tremendous headroom we see for our global business.\nTurning now to our business performance. Rachel and I will share details of our strong results delivered in the quarter and fiscal year 2023, and we will also share our confidence in the company's long-term opportunity with guidance for fiscal year 2024. What you will take away from this call today is that we have great momentum, fueled largely by our reinvention plan. We are seeing the work pay off through improved partner and customer experiences, as well as captured improvements in efficiency and margin. We believe this bodes well for this next year and for years beyond.\nTo deliver our long-term sustainable growth, we are focused on 5 areas. You will hear more on what we call our triple shot reinvention and our continued momentum this afternoon. The discussion will provide a more detailed outlook on our 3 core and 2 enabling priority areas. First, we will elevate the brand through our stores. Second, we will strengthen and scale in digital. Third, we will become truly global. Fourth, we will unlock efficiencies, including outside stock. Finally, we will reinvigorate the partner culture at Starbucks.\nIn the fourth quarter, our total company revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. Full year revenue reached a record of $36 billion, representing 12% growth year-over-year for fiscal 2023, or 14% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation, aligning our revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. Equally impressive, our global comparable store sales increased 8% year-over-year, both for the quarter and the fiscal year 2023, driven by a healthy mix of ticket and transaction growth.\nWe grew earnings per share by 31% to $1.06 for the quarter and by $0.20 to $3.54 for the fiscal year, again, aligning to the top end of our guidance range. Importantly, we grew margin by 310 basis points for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points on a full year basis. And we did all this while growing our global store count to over 38,000, in line with our store growth guidance of 7% in fiscal year 2023.\nDemand for stocks remains Starbucks around the world. Here in the U.S., our largest market, we saw momentum sustain throughout the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was up a record 12%, underpinned by 8% comps. We had a remarkable fall launch that led to record-breaking average weekly sales. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reached a new record this quarter of nearly 33 million 90-day active members, and setting records in spend per member and total member spend.\nCustomers remain loyal to their favorite 4 menu classics that have stood the test of time, including the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which celebrated its 20th anniversary. In addition to very strong performance in our core offerings, we also have strong performance with new offerings, including our Apple-inspired beverages and food items.\nThe results from the quarter, including the dynamic way we are driving ticket growth, give us great confidence in our menu innovation on both an individual product overall portfolio level. We have proven that complementary yet competing products and flavors can successfully coexist, such as pumpkin and Apple, with the right menu innovation, marketing mix and strategic pricing strategies.\nAs customer demands have evolved, we've delivered more beverages, food and personalization and customization across existing and new formats to meet their expectations and grow the business. Our continued investments in our partners, equipment, supply chain and technology are paying off, evidenced by a margin expansion across North America to 23.2% this past quarter.\nTimed with our busiest cold foam promotion of the year, the recent rollout of our new portable cold foamers to all U.S. company-operated stores, enhanced productivity in the fourth quarter. and lessened the trade on our partners, while continuing to meet the high cold beverage demand. In support of the continued growth in cold beverages, we delivered over 550 new Nugget ice machines and remained on track with installation prioritized for our most ice-constrained stores in fiscal year 2024.\nClover Vertica, our on-demand single-cup brewer, is now installed in over 600 of our stores across the U.S., and we continue the on-schedule rollout of the Siren System cold and food stations, prioritizing new stores and renovation locations. Our portfolio and pipeline management of new equipment design and rollout plans are robust and enabled us to deliver our results.\nWe have created a more stable environment in our stores. Hours per partner increased in the quarter by 5% as we continue filing schedules that fit our partners and customers' needs. Total was down in the fourth quarter by 10%, while barista tenure increased by 16% for the quarter. Customer connection scores also improved in the quarter relative to this time last year. We did all of this by investing over 20% of this year's profits back into our partners and stores through wages, training, equipment and new store growth. All this is further evidence that our strategy is working.\nTurning to International. In the fourth quarter, we saw record store growth of nearly 600 stores across the segment, with International store count remaining higher than that of the U.S. We also experienced record double-digit revenue growth internationally in the quarter, with continued growth on every key market around the world.\nOur comparable same-store sales in our company-operated markets for both the U.K. and Japan remained well above historical averages in fiscal year 2023, with growth attributed to higher profitability and higher productivity store formats, as well as elevated digital and partner experiences. We saw strong customer demand for our beverage and food offerings around the world with record global demand for our pumpkin platform.\nAnd in our international license markets, Starbucks Rewards programs grew by 4 million 90-day active members, now contributing to 30% of total sales, up 9 percentage points in just 1 year, driven by the growth for Starbucks Digital Solutions. Supported by our strong brand globally, outside of China, our International segment is well ahead of the growth pace we indicated at last year's Investor Day, with focused growth in our company-operated markets and motivated business partners powering our licensed stores.\nTurning to China. We were pleased with our performance in the quarter. delivering revenue growth of 8% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 6% impact of foreign currency translation. This has further supported by a comp of 5% squarely in line with our expectations. Full year revenue grew to $3 billion, up 3% from the prior year or up 11% excluding approximately 8% impact foreign currency translation with comp of 2%.\nOur performance in China improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter, with revenue in the second half of the year 20% higher than the first half, reflecting our growth momentum. These results underscore the strength of beverage and food offerings, the success of our market strategies and the powerful execution unleashed by our partners in China as we capture the abundant opportunities in front of us.\nWe continue to see strength from coffee-forward innovations, delighting our customers with locally relevant product innovation like the Moose Espresso and the smaller-sized Intenso range, a first in the world. We're also seeing higher food sales with tremendous headroom in this area, driving both transaction and ticket opportunities.\nIn Q4, we saw continued momentum across the omnichannel experiences of Starbucks in China with strength in store through Mobile Order & Pay, Mobile Order Delivery, E-commerce and in channels. China now has over [ 21 million ] active loyalty members, representing 22% year-over-year growth, with many members skewing younger to build our next generation of customers.\nIn the quarter, we opened a record 326 net new purpose-driven stores in China, reaching 13% net new store growth over the prior year to over 6,800 stores at the end of fiscal year 2023. The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year.\nFinally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today.\nThe momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business. These advantages include our uplifting partners, including our China leadership team, our distinctive stores, our vertically integrated and highly digitized efficient operations, and our relevant innovation. We will maintain our leading position in the premium market as we continue to grow in scale across our current portfolio and through new tiers of cities in this growing market of coffee drinkers.\nFinally, our channel business continues to elevate the Starbucks brand around the world at home and on the go, creating Starbucks moments for consumers outside of our retail stores. We're the #1 ready-to-drink brand around the world. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we celebrated our 5-year partnership with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé.\nThis Nestlé relationship, which includes We Proudly Serve Food service locations as well as additional partnerships, such as our Nova Mera channel partnership with PepsiCo and international partners like Tingyi and Arla have helped us grow our customer touch points, and is now in nearly 90 markets around the world.\nFor fiscal year 2023, we saw notable growth in our leading channel market position as well as accretive brand equity as we continue to be recognized for our innovation. Some notable accolades include awards in China Ready Select, in the Europe, Middle East, Africa multiserve business as well as achieving 1 billion in servings in Korea and selling out of Grab & Go in Japan.\nIn closing, while navigating an environment of unprecedented volatility throughout fiscal year 2023, we finished our fourth quarter and full year strong delivering on our guidance. Our reinvention is moving ahead of schedule, fueling revenue growth, efficiency and margin expansion. Notably, we continue to see the positive impact of our reinvention on our partner and customer experiences, proof points that we can continue to innovate, grow and strengthen our business while creating value for all.\nLooking ahead, we remain fully optimistic about our headroom across the U.S. and internationally, and we see limitless possibilities across all areas of the business. While the global business environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our ability to adapt and innovate to meet evolving consumer needs. We will continue to invest in our partners to expand upon our reinvention and to deliver on our sustainability and social impact initiatives, all while driving long-term growth.\nWe feel very good about the business momentum for next year, the continued strength of the brand and the opportunity for growth in the years ahead. I look forward to sharing greater detail around these strategies for growth with you later this afternoon. Our performance this past year and the plans ahead give us great confidence in the multiple paths we have in front of us to achieve our long-term results.\nI will now hand the call over to Rachel to walk you through further details of the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, as well as our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you this afternoon. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong Q4 and full fiscal year 2023 performance, which delivered on our full year guidance shared at the 2022 Investor Day. Our fiscal year 2023 double-digit earnings growth was a direct result of both double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, as our focus and disciplined execution of our reinvention delivered tangible financial results.\nOur Q4 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year or up 12% when excluding a 1% impact of foreign currency translation. As Laxman mentioned, the U.S. business delivered strong performance with record breaking average weekly sales from an overwhelmingly successful fall launch, and our International business was also strong, with China performing in line with our expectations. Combined, this resulted in our consolidated comparable store sales growth of 8% and net new company-operated store growth of 7% globally over the prior year, as well as sustained momentum in our global licensed markets.\nQ4 consolidated operating margin expanded 310 basis points from the prior year to 18.2%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by increased efficiency throughout our U.S. stores as our strong execution on reinvention amplified results even greater than we anticipated, coupled with sales leverage and pricing. Margin expansion continued to be partially offset by our investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs and support of reinvention.\nQ4 EPS was $1.06, up 31% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our segments, especially the U.S., as its results were bolstered by the amplified success of our reinvention. For fiscal year 2023, our consolidated revenue reached a record $36 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding approximately 2 percentage impact of foreign currency translation.\nConsistent with our guidance, our revenue growth included 8% comparable store growth and 7% net new company-operated store growth over prior year, as well as ongoing contributions from our global licensed store businesses. Our fiscal year 2023 consolidated op margin was 16.1%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. And EPS of $3.54 was up 20% over prior year. above our recent guidance of 16% to 17%. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q4.\nNorth America delivered another quarter of record revenue with $6.9 billion in Q4, up 12% from the prior year, driven by a combination of an 8% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 2% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% over the prior year and contributions from our licensed store business, which continues to benefit from increased travel. When considering growth from all stores, comp new and licensed, we were pleased to see more than 2/3 of our growth came from transactions, mix, attach and customization, which we collectively call demand.\nOur U.S. business delivered 8% comparable store sales growth in Q4, primarily driven by strong ticket performance with 6% comp growth, which benefited from volume, mix, attach, customization and pricing. Our customers continue to favor more premium beverages, creating a new normal as it relates to mix and customization. To fuel this, we continue to lean in with innovation, offering our Iced Pump Cream Chai Tea Latte, which boosted tea cells; as well as Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam, which become a customization favorite with our customers.\nIn addition to our beverage success, we also had another record quarter of food attached, driven by both our core breakfast sandwiches and promotional items, such as our Baked Apple Croissant. The success we're having in driving incremental spend gives us confidence that we're delivering meaningful value and a differentiated experience to our customers.\nTransaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 2%, which, combined with another quarter of a record ticket, drove multiple record average weekly sales, including delivering our sixth highest sales weeks ever, driven by our successful fall launch. Demand continued outside of our promotion windows, which translates to future opportunity as we leverage targeted offers to our most loyal customers, increasing efficiency as we create a more personalized experience.\nAs it relates to demand, it was another record-breaking quarter for key aspects of our Starbucks Rewards program, active members, spend per member and total member spend, which all surpassed previous highs. To further illustrate the strength of demand, we saw total customer growth among our occasional customers as well. Collectively, this demand speaks to the stickiness of our business. That, coupled with increased customer connection scores and growth across transactions, mix, customization and attach, all leads to a durable and growing business.\nU.S. licensed store revenue remained strong in Q4, up 18% from the prior year, benefiting from consumers adopting pre-covid routines of summer and business travel and expanded digital offerings, such as MOP and airports and curbside at select retailers, enabling us with more ways to meet our customers where they are, supporting increasing demand. North America's operating margin was 23.2% in Q4, expanding 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by increased efficiency in our stores, largely from reinvention, sales leverage and favorable impacts of pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners.\nMoving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, up 11% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 3% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth momentum continues off of a remarkable prior quarter and stems from double-digit growth in the majority of our international regions demonstrating global strength.\nThe segment delivered a 5% increase in comparable store sales driven by a 6% transaction growth, as store traffic increased and digital engagement continued with an increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 12% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as they had their highest store openings this year, equating to almost 4 new store openings daily in Q4, exceeding our expectations. Collectively, the segment surpassed the 20,000 store mark with ample headroom for growth across markets in the years to come.\nShifting to China. As Laxman shared, China's revenue in the quarter and on a full year basis grew by double digits driven by strength in our new stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, China's average weekly sales grew quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth. Comparable store sales growth of 5% was driven by strong transaction growth of 8% over the prior year, reflecting the strong brand affinity we create with locally relevant food and beverage and the consistent experience our partners deliver with every visit, differentiating us in the market.\nWe continue to see long-term growth in China with significant opportunities in dayparts, digital offerings and store format, and accordingly, continue to make investments for the future of our partners, stores and local community. Notably, in the quarter, as Laxman shared, we opened the Coffee Innovation Park, our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., demonstrating our unwavering commitment to our business in China.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 15.2% in Q4, expanding 70 basis points over the prior year, driven by sales leverage partially offset by digital investments. We are pleased with our margin, reflecting the strength of business and enabling us to unlock capital to reinvest back in the business to fuel growth.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue was $486 million in Q4, essentially flat over the prior year, in line with our expectations. This was driven largely by at-home coffee, while probably holding the #1 share position in the category at 16.1%, as well as the #1 position in ready-to-drink achieving our highest share in 2 years. Our fall launch in conjunction with our North America coffee partnership drove our performance resulting in the segment growing better than overall category.\nSegment's operating margin was 55.8% in Q4, up an impressive 520 basis points from prior year and exceeding our expectations, driven by ongoing strong performance in the North America coffee partnership. This segment continues to be highly margin accretive to our business and we're excited by the significant profit growth we're seeing in this channel.\nShifting to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our guidance accounts for the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as we see it today. Additionally, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. First, let me start with the foundation of our growth, comparable sales growth.\nWe expect fiscal year 2024 global comp growth to be 5% to 7%. While this is a change from our prior year global comp guidance of 7% to 9%, our comp range, coupled with our strong new store performance and momentum in our licensed business, drives a broader and more durable growth narrative supporting our attractive consolidated revenue growth.\nFor color, our fiscal year 2024 U.S. comparable store sales are expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7% as our business continues to have substantial headroom spurred by our leading innovation and technology, increasing customer loyalty and strong digital engagement as evidenced by the U.S. finishing fiscal year 2023 with strong performance of 9% comp growth.\nAnother positive driver of our fiscal year 2024 5% to 7% global comp growth is the performance in China, with comp expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4, with a higher comp in Q1 as we lap prior year mobility restrictions. Such growth is fueled by our increasing digital capability, coupled with the local opportunity we see stemming from our relevant product innovation and purpose-designed stores, which are resonating with customers and driving engagement. Our new store performance, combined with our strong China comp guidance, will give another year of double-digit revenue growth in the market, delivering on our momentum.\nNext, in thinking of our global new store growth, we expect global new store growth of approximately 7%, with approximately 75% of the growth still coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to focus on our strategic global expansion, reaching nearly 41,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal year 2024. We -- of the approximate 7% growth, we expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% in fiscal year 2024, driven by our dynamic portfolio format, expanding our white space opportunity.\nWe anticipate China will continue its rapid growth of approximately 13% in fiscal year 2024, given the attractive unit economics of our new stores. We expect the remainder of our growth will be driven by the robust development in our other markets around the world that are leveraging the strength of our brand internationally and becoming more global.\nThe combination of our global comp growth that I discussed a few minutes ago and our global store growth as well as continued growth in our licensed business, sets the foundation of our consolidated revenue growth. For fiscal year 2024, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to continue in the range of 10% to 12%, albeit at the low end of the range. This does not include any impact from foreign currency translation.\nWe expect the foundational elements of our growth will be partially offset by an expected high single-digit revenue decline in our Channel Development segment largely related to the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and broad optimization. Absent those impacts, Channel Development revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We're proud to reinforce yet another year of double-digit revenue growth at the low end of a 10% to 12% range, building on a very strong fiscal year 2023 performance, all of which reinforces the confidence we have in our business and opportunities we see ahead.\nShifting to operating margin. We expect progressive margin expansion in fiscal year 2024 as we continue to deliver efficiency both in and out of our stores, inclusive of approximately $1 billion in incremental high-return, growth-oriented investments balanced across our partners, stores and customers across wages, new store equipment and enhancements, digital and product innovation and supply chain modernization.\nWe will also continue our focus and discipline in unlocking strategic efficiencies across our business, and have multiple work streams underway to support approximately $1 billion in incremental leverage opportunity. These efficiencies, paired with sales leverage and strategic pricing, support continued investment in our business even as we expand margin and grow earnings over the long term. We will provide greater detail around our efficiency work streams in our strategy meeting later today.\nIn addition, we expect our Channel Development segment to continue to be accretive to overall operating margin, with operating margin expanding to the high 40% to low 50% range from their favorable portfolio mix.\nMoving on to capital allocation. Through a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, our return on invested capital in fiscal year 2023 approach 25%, a meaningful improvement from prior year. Equally important, we expect this upward trajectory to continue in fiscal year 2024. We expect our CapEx in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $3 billion, with over 85% of our CapEx directly invested in our global store portfolio.\nWe also expect to continue our stable dividend approach and remain committed to targeting an approximate 50% dividend payout ratio, displaying our confidence in our long-term growth and attracting a broad investor base, which benefits all stakeholders. As one of the highest dividend payers among high-growth companies, we are proud to have recently commemorated our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase with a CAGR of 20% over such period.\nOur capital allocation strategy has positioned us well to be able to continue significant business investments while retaining financial flexibility and maintaining our BBB+ investment grade credit rating. Regarding tax rates in fiscal year 2024, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is higher than our fiscal year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to reoccur in fiscal year 2024.\nIn closing my guidance comments, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the 15% to 20% range. Proudly, we expect our double-digit EPS growth will be a result of a balanced plan, compromised of both revenue growth and margin expansion.\nOverall, we are pleased with the durability of our business and strong foundation fiscal 2023 has set for fiscal year 2024, and our guidance is a product of our confidence in our continued long-term growth. We look forward to telling you more about our limitless opportunities in our afternoon strategy meeting.\nBefore I close and turn it over to Tiffany, I want to thank the more than 450,000 partners who wear the green apron across the globe for their tireless contributions to create the experience that makes Starbucks such a meaningful place for all of our customers. It's because of you that I have such great confidence in the opportunity ahead. Tiffany?\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVice President of Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rachel. At this time, we'll proceed with our normal Q&A session, which will last until the top of the hour. Just for clarification, this Q&A session shall be focused on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results and fiscal year 2024 guidance. Questions on topics outside of either of those should be held into our afternoon strategy meeting.\nKevin, please open the call for questions.",

In a few moments, Rachel Ruggieri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong will then join us for Q&A. To start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan.\nSince stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand. Powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long term shareholder value.\nIt was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must win opportunities and investments for our foundational Reinvention Plan. While Rachel will walk you through the detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in five key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom.\nOur first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America. Our North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization, and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition where we are already industry-leading has improved further by 11% YoY. Through scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in-store, and critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity.\nInnovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of US beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% YoY. Additionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track. Our faster and easier to use portable handheld cold foam blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all US company-operated stores in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers Frozen Beverages.\nThe new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually.\nThe Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all US company-operated stores. Taken altogether, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest dayparts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks experience and further differentiating us from competitors.\nIn this past quarter in North America we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double digits with high attach rates across dayparts, the mornings as well as the afternoons. Also, in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform which skews towards an afternoon occasion has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers Frozen Beverages customization in our Oleato beverage platform as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew which enters our testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter with a rollout across US company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024. Food is also fueling growth.\nThis past quarter we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches, as an attached business food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales. Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time.\nWe also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the US including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our siren system equipment rollout and we plan to move all stores to brand forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and day part activation. We are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago and now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets. Starting from a position of strength.\nAs a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter we continue to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the US, an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year. Starbucks Rewards members in the US drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year. In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance, and customer engagement in the market.\nStarbucks has had a long track record of industry leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience, and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation including payment and delivery enhancements in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers. This includes developments in the US mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market.\nOur third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores, and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top-line growth across the international segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the UK. While our geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance, our international store growth was 10% YoY.\nNew stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets.\nTurning to China, I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand which is known as xing ba ke locally. Looking at our Q3 results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long term health of our business.\nDespite these being early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning day part, while other day parts reported sequential monthly improvement.\nA strong recovery in the Q3 was amplified by the many declines. Distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China.\nThe first and foremost advantage is our incomparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high-quality coffee, and passion for delivering the Starbucks experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers. Our second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint. Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xingbake manner reflecting local arts, crafts, and calligraphy. In the fall we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the US. This next generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center.\nThird, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea drinking culture. Today we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve program in China. And yet there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market. Some growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That's significantly lower coffee consumption than in tier one cities like Shanghai where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai.\nCompare this also to Japan, where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China and the US, where the per capita is closer 380.\nWe are still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets.\nWith our locally based investments in R&D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon Dumplings, which had an amazing quarter. We have built a brand that is highly relevant for China in China, and we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win.\nFinally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated through the highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings including delivery and curbside for our on the go business.\nA comment on our international business. Beyond the US and China, we are seeing very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us looking outside the stores. In the third quarter our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% YoY, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points YoY, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on the go customer. We continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel through innovation as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink introduced last quarter and the grab-and-go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory.\nWe saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China.\nOur fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on the vast opportunity in stores. Also above stores, we have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity. We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make our operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks experience.\nThis is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores, as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings three decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks and will be critical in these efforts along with sales leverage. What I can see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion.\nFinally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company, and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating a culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity just as we always have, and that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me. We will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world.\nIt is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders, and soon a new set of values that will re-ground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar brand and company into one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand, delivering to customers what the world needs most right now: human connection. As I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless.\nWhat I see is a durable, iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10%-12 and earnings growth of 15%-20.\nI look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater details in November, in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid meeting format. We will share more details in the coming weeks, and with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable Q3 financial performance of the quarter. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world and fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our US business delivered record-breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It is clear we have abundant opportunity ahead. Our overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan, and it's unfolding into tangible financial results.\nAs a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year, and that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers, and innovative products fueled strong sales, resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally YoY, as well as continued momentum in our global licensed markets.\nQ3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing, and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our US stores. Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&A cost in support of reinvention.\nQ3 EPS was $1 up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio. I will now provide segment highlights for Q3.\nNorth America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions respectively as well as net new company operated store growth of 4% YoY. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business. Our US business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3 primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach, and customization. Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead.\nIn Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just five years ago. cold foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by two of every five customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just five years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches, leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter.\nTransaction.\nComparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% YoY, in line with a record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks, as evidenced by the growth in customization attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher margin revenue. Another proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts: a record number of active members, spend per member, and total member spend.\nThese records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection scores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks experience.\nUS licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio, and benefit from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering now rolled out across all major US airports.\nNorth America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan for Siren. The reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage, largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan.\nMoving on to International in the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding a more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores largely in China, and as well as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base.\nIn addition, the international segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth YoY, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market.\nExcluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum with revenue growing 11% YoY in Q3, or up 14% when excluding a 3% impact from foreign currency. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets. Excluding China, International had 8% store growth YoY, and approximately 35% of our new stores year to date were drive-thru, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-thru channel, furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally.\nShifting to China, China had a strong quarter delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last five years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3 in line with our expectations. Comp growth was driven by strong transactions which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumpling Festival food, and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly three stores per day. Average weekly sales in China grew quarter over quarter and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid single digits resulting in similar sized comp growth for the quarter.\nWith the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners, and communities and will have our largest roasting plant outside of the US, the Coffee Innovation Park opening this fall. Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term. Operating margin for the international segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures.\nShifting to channel development. The Segment's revenue contracted 6% YoY to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee, while proudly holding the number one share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remains strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American Coffee Partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category. Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance. A perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drinks that Laxman mentioned earlier.\nThe segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North American Coffee Partnership and sales mix shift, as previously shared. Operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio.\nNow moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023.\nGiven we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clearer visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention, plan unfolding, and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November to the low end of the 15%-20 growth range to a growth of 16%-17 for full year fiscal year 2023.\nDespite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10%-12, global comp growth near the high end of 7%-9, and solid margin expansion, store growth, capital spend, and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings respectively. With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4.\nFirst, in regard to international, looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand YoY but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality, along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter over quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid single digits in Q4.\nWith similar sized comp growth as the market's lapping, government stimulus for customers, and favorable discounting from prior year, coupled with the timing difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth, we continue to expect a low- to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance, as well as a record-breaking year of net new store development.\nFinally, as it relates to channel development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift, with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year. In summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing, and our strong brand, successful product innovations, and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and and our discipline. Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business.\nAs a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance, including Revenue, has been reiterated, and we are confident to move our Earnings growth to 16%-17 for full year fiscal 2023. Finally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customers' day brighter by extending an act of kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A, Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow up questions as time allows. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nYour first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please state your question.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I had one question and then just one clarification to Laxman's comments. The question is just on the US comp and traffic. Looks like the traffic was modestly positive this quarter, slowing a little bit from last quarter. I think it's safe to say that there's going to be some slowing in the menu pricing in forward quarters and therefore the average ticket. With the comp slowing and the average ticket likely to slow, just wondering your confidence in the current algorithm for that 7%-9 comp looking into next year. The clarification is just Laxman. I think you mentioned that you would update long-term guidance when you report the fiscal fourth quarter. But with that said, I think you did mention the 10%-12 revenue growth long term and 15%-20 EPS growth.\nSo is that safe to say that those are levels you're comfortable with as we look out into future years or all things are on the table as you offer your initial guidance next quarter? Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nWell, there were several questions in there, so let me just break this up. There was a question on the third quarter, there was a question about our expectations for the balance of the year, and then there was a question about what I said earlier about my confidence in the multiple parts to achieving the 10%-12 growth as well as the 15%-20 earnings growth. And I'll comment on all three. So let me first start with Q3. Q3 for us was a very strong quarter as Rachel mentioned as well. It's aligned with our expectations. Our comps were consistent every month. You know, we came off a lap in Q2 which was the impact of Omicron and so we had a 7% comp, very consistent month over month. The comp in Q3 was lapping a 9% comp from last year.\nSo it's a 16% comp on a two-year basis. And so if you look at this, it's really the strength of the brand, the actions and pricing we took, but also the growing levels of customization and levels of food attach that Rachel mentioned as well. And that is what led to the average weekly sales in Q3 continuing to break records. Now your question on transactions. Transactions in Q3 grew YoY across all dayparts. Traffic is below 2019 levels, but units per store are above the 2019 average coming from higher food attach. So the food growth along with more customization and judicious price increases led to this record weekly sales that you saw in the quarter. So transactions, as I said, have grown YoY across all dayparts. We also had a strong increase in ticket.\nYou know, this is sort of balanced between the pricing, which is very judicious, but also customization and increase in the number of units. Delivery sales doubled in Q3 compared to a year ago, most of which is incremental occasions for our customers. So that's Q3. Let me just highlight something about our loyal customers because that in some ways gives you a sense of the strength of the brand. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members have grown 4 million in number YoY. They come in more frequently, they buy more, and interestingly enough, you know, as we've seen our sizes, we actually see the growth of our larger sizes over our smaller sizes. So we're not seeing the down trading in our customer base. Our stored value credit, the balance of the card, is also growing sequentially.\nThat's how we exit, you know, Q3 as you look at the balance of the year, you know. We feel that first of all, the analyzation of the pricing actions will continue. We don't have any lagging significant comp impacts from the previous year, and we do expect pricing trends to moderate as we go into the final quarter, as you said. But we do expect to end the year in line with the comp expectations of 7%-9 growth that we had set. Now, in terms of answering your question about the long term, what I have seen in both top line as well as in the earnings growth gives me real confidence in the fact that what we've guided to previously, the 10%-12 revenue growth and the earnings growth of 15%-20, we have multiple paths to getting to that.\nSo that just really signals the resilience of the business, the durability of the brand, and the multiple paths. We see both in terms of top line as well as earnings growth, which I'm happy to elaborate on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please state your question.\n\nSharon Zackfia\n\nHead of Consumer Equity Research, William Blair\n\nHi, good afternoon. I was curious about the comments on the number of hours per partner. Can you give us kind of some color around where that is now and where you'd like that to be in the US, how long you think it takes to get there, and kind of what the associated productivity improvements would be. I assume that's throughput related, but, but would love some color on that.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nSo we're feeling very good about the progress we are making in this area. You know, our foundational reinvention plan that we announced last year is essential to the improvements that we're seeing now. We're making very good progress on it. There are meaningful improvements to the store environment as well as the productivity gains that we're making. Our recruitment rollout is on track. Our peaks are growing faster than the rest of the day parts, and we're making strong progress on a scheduling and staffing basis. If you look at the retail team barista total was down. As I said, 9% reduction versus previous year, 2% reduction versus just the second quarter.\nWhat you see, the combination of investments as well as the scheduling improvements that we're making, the economic proposition, their take-home pay to our baristas has improved by 20% YoY, and we have more improvements coming, and you're going to see us make improvements month over month in terms of the improvements.\nThat we're making. I mean, we're going to ensure that we continue to increase these average hours through better staffing and scheduling, but also work to accommodate their preferences, including the many that we attract who are keen on a part-time schedule. So this is progress that we're making week over week, month over month. There's more to come next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen. Please state your question.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks. It's a two part question on China, Belinda. It's hard to ignore the amount of discount activity in China by competitor coffee shops that one competitor indicated earlier today will persist for a number of years.\nCurious if you can talk?\nAbout new strategies in place for Starbucks to help protect traffic without degrading the brand's premium status. Then my other question is either for Rachel or Laxman, but you know, you mentioned margin headroom a couple of times. You know, amid that volatile China macro, what are the offsets if the model's China performance weakens. You know, the 10-Q I know called out a sequential increase in North America productivity improvements from Q2. So, you know, maybe that's perhaps an area where there's more room to grow or. Or perhaps there's another area that I'm not thinking about that allows for some cushion in the model if we were to see China macro become a little bit more uncertain.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nGot it. I'll get Belinda to take the first question, Rachel to take the second, and then I'll come in with some summary comments at the end. Belinda, great.\n\nBelinda Wong\n\nChairwoman and CEO, Starbucks China\n\nThank you for your question, Andrew. First of all, I want to say that there's no noticeable impact to our sales performance in Q3. In fact, I'm very happy with our Q3 performance and the sequential improvement that we achieved. We have been and will continue to stay focused and disciplined in our discount investment to optimize and deliver incremental return. On the competition topic, we welcome competition. They actually expand the coffee market and accelerate adoption and frequency of coffee consumption. Different brands bring in different value propositions and occasions. I just want to talk about our value propositions. We're in the human connection business.\nSince day one, 24 years ago when we entered China, we have been focusing on delivering a premium experience defined by the quality of our coffee and the emotional experience we've built with our customers and our partners that can't be replicated anywhere else. Our China business is strategically built to serve a diverse range of customer needs and occasions, physical and digital, fast and slow. The unique business model and capabilities we have built that Laxman mentioned gives us distinctive competitive advantages. We'll double down on our investment in our product innovation, store experience, visualization in our people to create even more distinctive advantages to capture the limitless opportunities in China in the future.\nThank you. We're playing the long game.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nYeah. And Andrew, I would just follow that up with, you know, as we look at the performance in China, we're encouraged by the healthy that we're seeing today. And even as we see a shift more towards digital, which does have a lower margin percentage overall, it's driving more revenue. And that's no better way to drive margin expansion than through sales leverage. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing today. In addition to that, the team's been very judicious about creating operational efficiencies. So the margin opportunity in China continues to be healthy.\nThat said, if we do see that there are challenges in the future, we've structured our guidance such that it allows us room, which is one of the reasons why we're very intentional in being more directive around qualitative language on margin, saying this year would be solid margin expansion. In the future, it would be progressive, which will allow us to continue to navigate the business and continue to invest where needed so that we can deliver on that 15% to 20% earnings growth that we've guided to.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nWell, let me just close with a couple of observations. I was in the China market for an extended period in this quarter, and I got to actually work with our partners and stores. I got to spend time in our supply chain. I got to spend time in our support centers, including looking at our teams that are leading what we do in digital. And I have to tell you, I've been going to China, studying China, advising on China, running business with China for 20 years. This is a very unique business. It's been a business has been built with love, and it's remarkable in terms of the passion our partners have. I was very impressed. I think it's just still early days. I mean, when you start looking at the headroom you have, and as Belinda said, the headroom is large.\nSo as people come into the market, you know, they're essentially driving a conversion of tea to coffee which of course, remember for 20 years we've been doing and we've got to 12 cups per capita. The numbers, by the way, significantly higher in Shanghai, but it's still much lower than a tea drinking country like Japan which has had a history of coffee house culture over time. So the headroom is really large. If you look at what we also do with our brand, don't forget we have these, we proudly serve Starbucks points of customer connection. In addition, our ready-to-drink partnership with Tingyi is also growing significantly and we're also available for coffee at home. So our brand is being built across multiple channels and the investments we're making in digital are very strong.\nWith the investments we're making to more vertically integrate our supply chain, it gives a greater flexibility in China and also greater productivity. So I think, in addition to that, your other question of productivity, as I look at what I see with regard to the opportunities we have both in the stores and above stores, and that, by the way, cuts across all the whole business. We have further productivity opportunities, which just gave us confidence on margin in terms of the progressive margin improvement that we have made. So early days in China, market going to expand, and further opportunities for us to get productivity.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. State your question, please. Thank you.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask just about the point on kind of supply chain and procurement. I think you guys have been pretty clear on the labor side, what the opportunity is there, what you're doing. Could you elaborate though, just more on the supply chain side and where you see the most opportunity there, how that factors into where you think margins can go?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nGreat. I'll take that. As I look at what we've been working on over the last six months or so, it's very clear that the investments we're making in our stores is yielding the kind of productivity that you would see, the efficiency as well as the throughput that we get. But what is interesting is if you look end to end, we have opportunities pretty much everywhere, both in terms of what we buy, how we buy it, how we flow products to stores, the services that we provide to our business, and the technology investments that we're making. We have opportunities everywhere. And I think that's part of the reason why, you see, we've added Arthur Valdez to the team. And just an example, you know, the availability of breakfast sandwiches went up over the course of the last quarter.\nWhat you see as a consequence of that is the attach rates went up as a result of it. So I think that those are just examples of the kind of improvements that we're seeing. Clearly, we're seeing benefits as you know, with regard to freight and the cost of it and the ability for us to rethink how we do what we do is large. So there is opportunity there for us in terms of bringing automation in, flowing products better, buying better, and frankly developing a supply base that can also keep up with the kind of scale and growth plans that we have.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I had a question on transaction growth and what you've seen in your rewards membership, and I'm wondering if there's an insight there. You know, over time, since 2019, you've had over 80% increase in your Active Rewards membership. It's 15% higher than a year ago. You noted that transactions were up 1% in the quarter and down versus four years ago. It looks like maybe frequency is down, maybe the consumer is using you differently, consolidating orders, certainly bolstering the check by having more items per order. Are you seeing any sort of solves from a marketing standpoint? You have very good visibility into what your consumers are doing. You have over half of your orders, you know your consumer, and you see what they're doing and the frequency they're coming.\nI'm wondering about the tools you see from a consumer side versus some of the more operational stuff you've been talking about as ways to unlock growth. Thanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp",
    "content2": "I think. First of all, let me just clarify something in your question. I think you suggested. You made a couple of comments about our Starbucks Rewards members. Let me just give you.\nLet me just address that. We have more of them. So we've had four million growth YoY. It's a 15% growth. Our Starbucks Rewards members come in more frequently. So they're not coming in less frequently; they're coming in more frequently. They buy more after joining the program.\nAs I said, they're also choosing larger sizes as they come in.\nThe investments we have made in marketing and what we're doing with digital in particular, what it tells you is that we are even further increasing the pace at which we are bringing innovation and.\nChanges in terms of what we do. We have a whole list of benefits that we could bring, and we're taking up the agility of the company in terms of the investments we make, which will help us make this even bigger and stronger. So that's the way I would address your question about the Starbucks Rewards members. It's a key area of growth. The other thing you should be aware of is, as we have scaled this, we have scaled this to Connect, which is all our licensed stores, and I think 40% of our licensed stores today have Connect. We're seeing growth in our licensed business as well as a consequence of that. Finally, we're scaling this globally. You're seeing us take it to our geographic partners, the Starbucks Digital Solutions.\nThere's very strong adoption, and you're seeing the kind of results you see, which are geographic license partners.\nAre announcing or are sharing with us. I mean, very strong results. And Starbucks Digital Solutions is extremely capable of delivering that in China. We're seeing real growth there too. And in fact, that is where we're making a big investment as well in digital because we see that as a way not just to strengthen our relationship, but also to drive results through what we do with digital. So I think overall this is a big area. It's a big area of focus for me and it's part of the second big priority for us around strengthening and scaling digital. I'll make a last comment. You know, we have a fundamentally amazing capability called Deep Brew inside the company. It's where we've made investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nI think the ability for us to be at the vanguard of this and to early adopt what we do in this area. Furthermore, given all the innovations that are going on and the re platforming that's going on, just gives me greater confidence in what we're doing. Digital. This will be a key area of growth for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. I was hoping that if you could address the biggest opportunities to kind of regrow same-store transactions pre-2019. I mean, what those—I guess as you see—kind of the bigger opportunities to be, whether in daypart or specific type of customer. And secondly, with same-store traffic up 1%, do you feel like you are specifically addressing peak hour throughput? In other words, is the factory part of Starbucks, as you would call it, properly set up? Is the engine specifically running such that you can achieve all those peak hour transactions, especially where mobile orders might be coming in at a very short amount of time? Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nI think, John, thank you for the question. Let me first start with your peak question. We're doing definitely better than what we did before because of the investments that we are making. But we still have further headroom, and I think as we make more investments, as we sort of further refine how we think about scheduling and staffing, how we ensure that we get the flows right in our store, we will have the ability to take that up even further. So the day part, the peak day parts are actually growing and growing really well. Now to answer your question about opportunities, there's opportunity pretty much across the board. If I look at beverage and beverage innovation, terrific, strong innovation coming, more to come.\nIf I look at dayparts, we have opportunities in the afternoon day part, and you know, our Starbucks Refreshers is a way for us to attack that. And as you know, we have; it's a big and sizable business, but it doesn't yet fully meet the full needs of what we could do in the afternoon. If I look at food attach, it's at the highest level we've had, but we have the ability for us to continue to elevate and innovate in food in order for us to further grab the opportunity that we have there. You know, delivery is an opportunity that, as I said, it's just early days. I mean, we've almost built a $1 billion leg, and that's just the US. If I look at China too, it's growing enormously.\nSo we have a leg there too in terms of what we could do with COVID delivery. And furthermore, I said earlier that we actually have an opportunity with regard to the net store growth in the US. There's real headroom for us to also locate our stores where we see customer growth, smaller towns, different geographies, and we're clearly looking at all of it, not just with our own stores, but also with licensed stores. So John, it's a pretty rich set of areas as I look at growth and what we could get.\nThat is available for us. This is just North America.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please state your question.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nGreat, thanks. I just want to come back to North America operating margins. Could you maybe give us a sense of some of the drivers of North America operating margins going forward, maybe an order of magnitude? Do you see a path back to, if not exceeding, pre-pandemic levels? And then I guess within that, do you feel like the mix of drive-thrus may be heavier on drive-thrus these days versus where you were pre-pandemic? Does that help push the operating margins back up and above pre-pandemic levels? Thank you.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nHi Peter, this is Rachel. Thank you for the question. You know, we've been encouraged by the performance we've seen in North America both on the top line and on the bottom line. Year to date in North America we're sitting at about 19.9% margin with about 40 basis points of expansion. That's driven by a combination of sales leverage, pricing, and the benefits from the reinvention plan showing up in productivity, which is helping to offset some of the investments we've made. We see opportunity to continue to expand margin over the long term as the benefits of the reinvention continue to amplify. So I would look at that as really the reinvention is a significant driver of our opportunity in terms of margin expansion. Through reinvention we're unlocking capacity to be able to serve demand that leads to sales leverage.\nAnd in addition to that, we're creating efficiency and resiliency in the middle of the business that's also supporting margin expansion. So I look at it more about what we've already seen progress today with reinvention, what we expect to see going forward. And that leads us to solid margin expansion at the company level this year and progressive margin expansion in the future, which of course will be driven in large part by North America.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nI just want to say one thing. I think we're at the top of the hour, but there are a few more questions online, and so we're going to go over and take those questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please to your question.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, great. Thank you. Question. Then maybe a point of clarification. You know, I know Rachel, you know you talked about the high end of the 7% to 9% same store sales guide for the full year. But you know there's a lot going on still, you know, some reopening tailwinds perhaps in China. You know, certainly I think in the past you've talked about even in other markets with more travel. So kind of being at the high end of that range, I guess I'm, I'm trying to think through kind of the sustainability, especially insofar as the first half in the US looks like it'll be substantially higher than the second half. So trying to just make sure I'm understanding how you're thinking about the ongoing comp, and then [the] question I have, Laxman, you mentioned unit growth.\nI think in the past when Starbucks has accelerated unit growth, there have been periods where it's kind of coincided with Starbucks slower traffic and ultimately kind of a need to rationalize the store base or reset it. What are the guardrails in place that change that this time around to make sure the unit growth doesn't conflict with continued traffic growth in your existing stores?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nSure. Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first question around comp, and when we look at the balance of the year related to comp, we just expect the momentum in the business to continue. So when you think about in North America in this current quarter, we were encouraged by the fact that our growth in comp was a combination of transaction growth. So we saw transactions grow above prior year in every single day part, and that was coupled with an elevated ticket, and that was a combination of not only strategic pricing but a balanced contribution from increased customization as well as record attachments that drove strong growth in the quarter.\nThat I would say from a revenue standpoint we have fundamentals from a revenue perspective that are broad, and we would expect that to continue, that momentum to continue as we look at the balance of the year and going on a full year basis. So that will continue to be fueled through innovation as well as through continued growth in our digital customer rewards, membership, and our increasing capability around convenience, including growth in digital. So we all see all of that as signs to help support the 7% to 9% comp range that we've guided on a full year basis. Then when you think about outside of North America, we'd say we expect our recovery to sustain in China.\nThat was through the guidance I gave around a low to mid single digit comp on a full year basis as well as contribution from international, and the momentum we're seeing. We think across the board the momentum we're seeing, the recovery in China coupled with the strong performance we're seeing in North America gives us the confidence to be able to maintain the 7% to 9% comp range on a full year basis for North America and then at the high end of the range for total company.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nSara, to your question about our store network and how we see it, I am not concerned. I mean I think there's a very small number of stores that you would normally consider that we would consider in the normal course of business that we would look at and say we may have a challenge with them, but there's nothing in there that concerns me. What I'm looking at more from the standpoint of net store growth are the opportunities we have to further enhance our presence in many markets where we are under penetrated but also expose in some of our core markets multiple formats. I think we've referenced this before as purpose driven formats in terms of what we can bring into markets in order to meet various needs that customers have.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Joshua Long with Stephens. Please state your question. Great.\n\nJoshua Long\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nThank you for squeezing me in a couple times. In your prepared commentary, you referenced what sounds like to be normalizing demand within the at-home coffee channel, within channel development. So, just curious if you could unpack that a little bit, and just curious if you're seeing shifts within the portfolio on that side or if that's kind of an ongoing shift back into kind of retail brick-and-mortar as we get back to kind of return to office or just additionally any sort of commentary you can provide there in terms of how you're attacking that and capturing share as the shifts continue to unfold.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nRight. You know we have very strong share in out-of-home coffee. I think we're tied for number one. So we feel good about that. At the same time, what you are seeing with the customer is the customer is becoming more on the go, and what you are seeing with that is if you stop looking at channels where we have products like we have with our North American Coffee Partnership or frankly our stores, or our licensed stores, we're really benefiting from more from customers on the go. So you see some of that shift take place. But at-home coffee our shares are very strong. Go ahead.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nBut I would add that we are seeing a balance in the portfolio. So that's one of the things we're encouraged by, is that while we are seeing consumer behavior shift some, we're seeing an increase in our ready to drink both domestically and internationally. And that's helping to support the margin expansion we saw in this quarter and the mid-40s margin that we're guiding to on a full year basis. So I would say in this case, it's the strength of the diversified portfolio that's working to our advantage.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please take your question.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nEquity Research Analyst for Restaurants, Bernstein\n\nJust a question on the Siren System in the United States. How many stores have the Siren System today, and is the number on track with your internal expectations? What kind of uplift in productivity and margin is this initial rollout hinting at?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nRachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks Corp\n\nYes, from a Siren System standpoint, we're in just the testing phase today, and we're on track to be able to launch in conjunction with our renovations in new stores next year. Next year we expect to be less than 10% of our stores will have the Siren System reaching about 40% of our stores by the year 2026. So we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing. We're seeing good results, and we do expect it will help lead to margin expansion in the future.\nIt will be one of the many, what I'd say, equipment investments we're making, as well as the investments we're making in the staffing and scheduling within our stores, as well as the overall operational excellence focus that the team has. The combination of all of that in North America will lead to a more stabilized production environment, which will help drive margin expansion well into the future. And so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today, and we're looking forward to furthering the launch.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nJust one thing I'd add to is our pipeline of equipment innovation is very strong, and the way we manage the portfolio, the way we manage the pipeline, is very strong. If you look at some of the commitments that we had made around investments like the portable cold foam blender, it's one of the fastest rollouts in our history in terms of how it's reached all our stores. So when we have them ready, when we do the renovations, when we have new stores built in automatically, they are actually getting the Siren System. And I feel very good about the way we are managing the portfolio of investments that we are making in this area.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please state your question.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nSenior Analyst, Baird\n\nHi, good afternoon. I have a follow-up question on the commentary related to the longer-term targets. I know we're going to get more details in November on this. I think the comments were that you have multiple, multiple paths to deliver both the revenue and the earnings targets. I wanted to focus in on the revenue part of that, I guess.\nIf you continue to grow at the rate you're growing from a unit growth perspective, I think you would need to maintain that comps outlook that you gave previously to get to the revenue guidance. Unless I'm missing something. So I guess the question is, are you signaling that maybe the unit growth element could change and the comp element could change and you could still get there? I guess maybe any clarification on that front would be helpful.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nGreat. Let me take this point on the top line. First of all, Starbucks is an iconic brand with a very strong appeal and durability.\nIf you just look in the last year, the affinity of our brand is strengthened. Right? The brand has range across consumer segments, across geographies, across occasions. To your question on top line, we have a historically high number of customers who visit our stores, but it's also in many of the markets around the world. Even as China recovers, we have a strong pipeline of innovation across beverage, food, and equipment. There are even more opportunities across the world with purpose different formats as I mentioned earlier, with day parts and a focus on dayparts and how we can bring more innovation, particularly on the day part side, with new business models like delivery.\nWe've built this billion dollar leg, and it's only now that we're getting operationally refocused on that and saying how do we ensure that we continue to support that kind of delivery with an operating model that would actually help. I mentioned earlier that we have terrific capabilities in digital as well as in artificial intelligence and machine learning that we're just unleashing with even more agility in terms of how we strengthen and scale with digital. It's not just our stores, but it's also in the connect stores, and it's with Starbucks Digital Solutions across the world. We have strength in pricing capabilities, and as we make these investments, we're going to get even better in terms of revenue management, you know, building on the great work that's already been done in terms of managing mix, in terms of managing sizing, and in managing customization.\nYou know, we have a lobby that is further opportunity for us in terms of how we grow. I think just in terms of that, there's real opportunity in terms of net store growth. As I mentioned earlier, we do have even more headroom in new store builds, both in the US as well as internationally. Our China number is a milestone to even greater penetration, and some of the opportunities we see in the unit economics that we see in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa, these are real.\nWe have a range of formats where we can deliver this third place experience, but also deliver experiential convenience powered by digital in an omnichannel way. So I look at this brand, I look at its consumer appeal, I look at its durability, I look at its strength, I look at its range.\nIt feels very good to me that we will get to a revenue growth of 10% to 12%, and by the way, the earnings grow the 15% to 20% over time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good afternoon. Following up on the long term algorithm, if your comps were to slow to a mid single digit level for whatever reason, would you say that your 15% to 20% EPS is still on the table?\nIf so, could you talk about. What margin and other levers keep you confident?\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nThank you for your question. As I've said earlier. We see significant margin improvement opportunities and work that will come to productivity. We'll set the appropriate details of this at a later point. But I can just tell you this as I look at the investments we're making in store, but importantly what we see about the store, we have opportunities. So I feel very good about the 15% to 20% earnings growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks Corp\n\nThank you all for joining us on this Q3 2023 Earnings call. I deeply appreciate it and I look forward to seeing you all in November. Till then, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening."

Now, before I turn the call over to Laxman, I want to mention that our prepared remarks for today's call will run approximately 40 minutes, which is longer than what we plan for future calls. But we thought it would be beneficial to give Laxman ample time to provide his observations as our new CEO. Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. It's both a great privilege and responsibility to serve as Starbucks CEO. On behalf of the board of directors and our Starbucks partners, I'd like to thank Howard Schultz for his leadership of the company over the last year. Howard's return in April of 2022 came at a pivotal moment for the company and with great personal and family sacrifice. And I want to personally thank Howard for his over 40 years of ingenuity, creativity, service, and enduring love for our company and the iconic Starbucks brand, and for his willingness to always lean in in service of our partners and customers.\nSince joining in September, the company has given me a uniquely designed program to fully immerse myself in all aspects of our business.\nThe program involves spending time in our stores, distribution centers, roasting plants, support centers, and on our own coffee farm in Costa Rica. I have traveled to meet our partners and business leaders in several international markets across Asia, Latin America, and Europe. While Howard formally ran the company through Q2, my immersion exposed me to all aspects of day-to-day leadership responsibilities and well-prepared me to transition into the CEO role on 20 March , a few days ahead of our annual meeting of shareholders.\nI have learned about the company through the eyes of our founder, customers, farmers, partners, and the community, and through listening meetings with our shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, I've been actively listening and learning from our partners, working side by side to earn my barista certification and developing the deepest level of respect for coffee and barista craft.\nIn my time with the company, I've also been working closely with the executive leadership team. I have been impressed with the great progress and forward momentum of the company, and I am optimistic about our long-term growth headroom and the margin improvement potential. We also see great opportunity to further strengthen the business, elevate the brand, and do everything we can do to make this a great place for partners to work. We will continue to build our Reinvention plan with additional opportunities, and we will update you with these additional plans in due course.\nLet me start today's call by sharing my overarching observations, the progress and momentum from our reinvention, and the opportunities ahead for Starbucks. Rachel will then walk you through the details of our Q2 fiscal year 2023 performance. We will then open the call for Q&A.\nWhat you can take away today is confirmation that we are well-positioned to continue to unlock value for all our stakeholders. My first observation is that Starbucks is uniquely in the business of human connection. Since our earliest days, we have been a brand that brings people together. From the vantage points of serving customers in stores and in drive-thru windows, many are coming to us for connection with others. There is no doubt Starbucks has conventionally been the mainstay meet-up spot. At the same time, nearly 2/3 of US consumers are by themselves when seeking a beverage or food occasion.\nAs a world in a crisis of disconnection, where loneliness, division, and polarization have become far too common, the everyday ritual of coffee is a powerful way to make connection happen with others and with yourself.\nStarbucks delivers connection no matter how you visit us, in stores, drive-thrus, or digitally. We are there to provide this connection, any place, any time. That brings me to my second observation. Our performance is strong, but our health could be stronger. I've worked side by side with our partners in our stores and have experienced firsthand how our stores and our operations are still evolving to meet the demands of our customers.\nThere is more work to do to tailor our stores to the demand that we see, advance our technology, enhance how we innovate our equipment, and also, more fundamentally, how we get back to focusing on fundamental operations and executing better, a priority that is evident with my deep engagement over the last several months across supply chain, technology, reinvention, store development, store operations, marketing, and product.\nTake, for example, the Siren System that we showcased at Investor Day. This is one example of how we can continue to do more to better support our stores and, in turn, our partners. It is also about the operating processes that we have in our stores and how we make them even more robust. To strengthen our health, we need to think of our business as having theaters at the front with a factory in the back. Our theaters are where our store partners are focusing on their craft and delivering an elevated experience to our customers.\nTo simplify the store partner experience and drive greater productivity within and beyond the store level, we see significant efficiencies in our supply chain, support systems, and processes. This is what I mean by our opportunity to strengthen our factory in the back. Let me give you a few examples.\nToday, our store deliveries involve a high-touch, one-size-fits-all model. We are out of stock on more items than we would like. Through segmentation and a format-specific approach, we will be able to lower costs while creating a better experience for our partners and, ultimately, for our customers. We also have abundant opportunities to optimize what we buy across several areas, as well as opportunities in how we buy it. Currently, we have over 1,500 cup and lid combinations across our network. As we streamline, we will create a portfolio of fewer, more sustainable, and less costly cups while further simplifying operations in our stores.\nAll of these opportunities will deliver top-line growth and margin expansion, and create long-term value. My third observation is that we are a company that strives to be different, and we are now operating in a different kind of world.\nOne thing that has stood out to me here at Starbucks is our culture. Since my first day, it has been clear that Starbucks' culture is like that of no other company. There is a strong partner-first mentality that is both top-down and bottom-up. At the same time, the world in which we operate is evolving. There is clear opportunity to build stronger capabilities, drive even deeper engagement, and adapt a global mindset. With that in mind, as a leadership team, we fully acknowledge a need to evolve and modernize our brand, our business, our capabilities, and our culture to meet the needs of an ever-changing world.\nWe are, therefore, refounding the company. And as part of that, we are getting back to its basics. You already know about our reinvention.\nWe've also just recently introduced a new mission and set of promises as a contemporary expression of our mutual success. Our mission is this: with every cup, with every conversation, with every community, we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection. The rollout of this work across the globe is well underway. It is driving conversations at all levels within the company and is being met with overwhelmingly positive reception. As we evolve, what differentiates us will remain. We will modernize, yes, and we will stay true to who we are at our core, much like our promises say.\nWe are a company that, at its best, works to build bridges to a better future for our partners. At our best, we uplift the everyday for our customers. At our best, we ensure the future of coffee for all. At our best, we make positive contributions to our communities.\nAt our best with the environment, we give back more than we take. And as a result, we generate enduring long-term returns for our shareholders. These have been my three overarching observations. We are in the business of human connection. Our performance is strong, but our health can be stronger. Enable the theaters in the front by strengthening the factories in the back. And we continue to strive to be a different kind of company that is now operating in a different kind of world. Through this lens, we will be disciplined in delivering against what has been limiting us in our journey toward the limitless future.\nWe are seeing great progress in the work underway with our Reinvention plan and the capacity for much more. We've only just scratched the surface of what we can accomplish with this iconic brand and company.\nWe see significant growth headroom and the opportunity to further separate Starbucks from others. We also see opportunities to expand margins while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. With that, let me turn to our Q2 performance. The company exceeded expectations in Q2 fiscal year 2023 by nearly all measures, delivering strong results across the broader Starbucks portfolio. Our performance, including continued success in the US and international markets, as well as the recovery we've been seeing in China, can be attributed to the strength of the global brand, relevant innovation in our product and stores, and powerful execution by our partners.\nLet me first start globally and then with North America and the US. Our Q2 revenue was $8.7 billion, up 14% from the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2% impact of foreign currency translation.\nNorth America delivered revenue growth of 17% in Q2, growing to $6.4 billion. We captured a remarkable 11% comp growth globally, with 12% comp growth in both North America and the US for the Q2, driven by mid-single-digit growth balanced between transactions and ticket. Our North America growth comes on top of 12% comp growth in the prior year. We expect this demand to continue as we push the envelope with innovation. A recent example is the highly successful launch of Oleato, an innovation Howard identified and has personally led for us.\nIn fact, we've already reached an audience of 5 billion people since our announcement of the February global launch of Starbucks Oleato beverages, making this one of the top five product launches in the last five years in terms of brand awareness and excitement.\nThe new innovative beverage platform is currently available in 650 stores across three markets: Italy, Japan, and the US. Given the success we are seeing, we look forward to bringing this exciting new offering to more stores and more markets around the world this year. Scaled profitable innovation is one of the things that fuels our performance and is a continued area of focus. Our performance is the result of a near-perfect intersection of three things. One, our successful innovative beverages, such as our Pistachio Cream Cold Brew, that inspires the expanded use of modifiers.\nTwo, our in-demand food portfolio, which resulted in record sales of our Sous-vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches. And three, our attractive convenience capabilities of Mobile Order and Pay, drive-thru, and delivery, which saw sequential improvement and now accounts for 74% of Q2 US company-owned revenue.\nYou can expect us to lean strongly on purposeful innovation to further capture the tremendous opportunity, both in what we do and in how we do it. Speaking of convenience channels, our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards membership added more than 400,000 members in the quarter in the US, bringing our total membership to 30.8 million members. In addition, we've increased membership by 4 million year-over-year in the US, representing 15% growth. Rewards members account for 57% of US company-operated revenue in Q2, which marks the highest contribution on record and represents growth of 3% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe are excited about our growth in active rewards members as it's a contributing factor in consistent demand. We have been at vanguard in this area, and you can expect us to further invest and lead.\nAn example of that investment is Starbucks Connect, which is now in over 1/3 of our US licensed stores, giving our customers even more opportunities to engage with our brand. With such a diverse portfolio across our US licensed locations, such as hotels, airports, and other retailers, coupled with increasing offerings of convenience, we are able to capture further demand, evidenced by revenue in the quarter up 25% year-over-year, supporting our strategy to meet and serve our customers wherever they are. Moving on to reinvention, we are making great progress.\nThe investments we made in our partners, stores, and technology are already producing a return, whether it's through productivity gains or partner satisfaction. We are pleased with the multifaceted progress to date. For example, barista turnover reduced by over 9% from a high in March Q2 fiscal year 2022, leading to fewer new hires per store.\nWe've been able to increase the average hours per barista per week by 4% year-over-year, a metric we know is one of the many meaningful inputs in achieving the desired compensation of our partners. Clearly, partner scheduling is a real opportunity for us, and we are laser-focused on it. Additionally, items per labor hour, a metric which reached a record high in December 2022, continued a strong pace into and throughout Q2 despite seasonal trends. This demonstrates increased productivity in the midst of strong volumes, all while partner engagement and customer connection scores stabilized.\nThe rollout of handheld cold foam blenders supporting customization demand commenced in the quarter, with completion targeted for Q3, just in time to support our summer demand as the desire for cold foam customization continues to grow.\nThe Clover Vertica brewer has also begun to roll out in this quarter and will be in nearly 40% of our company-operated stores across the US by the end of this fiscal year. The Vertica offers our customers our freshest cup of brewed coffee while driving efficiencies in time and waste across our network. This is yet another example of how innovation amplifies what we do best, in this case, coffee served even better. The ultimate proof point of innovation and the progress against our reinvention is our Q2 margin in North America of 19.2%, a 200 basis point expansion year-over-year. We have more to do to reinvent our business.\nThough we have further opportunity ahead, we are proud to see that our strategies are working and momentum is building. Moving on to international, we are pleased with the strengthened growth across our broader portfolio.\nQ2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% from the prior year and up 19%, excluding 10% impact of foreign currency translation, representing our third-highest quarterly revenue due largely to China's faster-than-expected recovery. We also achieved the highest-ever quarterly system sales internationally, and we delivered a company-operated 7% comp driven by transaction growth, spotlighting demand. Strong comps were also captured across the regions outside of China, with markets like Japan and the UK both posting double-digit comps for the eighth consecutive quarter. We're very pleased to see our international store strategies working.\nIn the quarter, our net new stores grew by 363, representing 8% growth year-over-year. As we look ahead to the end of the fiscal year, we will reach 20,000 stores across the international segment on pace with the growth strategy we outlined at investor day.\nWe expect China to remain on track to achieve our 13% net new store growth target for this year. Additionally, Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and Latin American markets are also expected to contribute meaningfully, becoming an area of further emphasis and a more significant contributor to our overall global growth. Moving on to China, Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge from three years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned.\nWe saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand, and the close relationships that we have built with our customers. We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11%, excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation.\nComp growth of 3% marks the first positive comp since Q3 of fiscal year 2021. Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores from the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores in the past three years, despite COVID disruptions and mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability. Further accelerating recovery is our rapidly expanding omnichannel business.\nStarbucks Delivers achieved 21% year-on-year growth to make up 23% of the sales mix, while overall mobile ordering reached 47% of sales, 4% over the prior year.\nDelivery demand remained robust even after consumer mobility has recovered, demonstrating that it is highly incremental and interwoven into our customers' lifestyles. Our attractive portfolio supports the increasing demand, putting us in a position of strength to capture opportunity as China transitions to this next phase of recovery. While we don't expect a straight-line recovery, we are confident in our long-term opportunity. We look forward to serving our customers with the elevated experience only Starbucks can deliver. Now, let me wrap up the segment performance with channel development.\nOur Starbucks brand and successful partnerships continue to fuel the success of our channel development business, with revenues of over $480 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Our US at-home coffee continues to resonate with customers as our winning the seasons with our well-received promotions and product launches.\nIn terms of ready-to-drink, Starbucks has outgrown the category in sales growth for two consecutive quarters and remains the number one brand in the US. To continue this trend, we launched our much-anticipated Pink Drink and Paradise Drink, which have already been met with overwhelming excitement. Before I pass the call over to Rachel, I want to again extend my gratitude to our partners, our leadership team, and to Howard for the significant progress we have made as a company this past year.\nI also want to reinforce my confidence in our reinvention, the work underway to refound our business, brand, and culture, and our position to fully realize the limitless potential of Starbucks. For our long-term sustainable growth, we will look to discover ways to, first, further elevate the brand by getting the basics right, operating our stores well and with a beverage-forward, food-attached focus for innovation.\nSecond, build on our leadership position in digital by scaling and introducing new and relevant customer experiences. Third, evolve to a more global presence for our business and for our brand. Fourth, work to become less wasteful and move with greater speed. And fifth, and critically, reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. With a Reinvention plan driving progress against our business goals, a contemporized mission, and a brand differentiated through human connection, our momentum is strengthening the business overall. Our focus on delivering elevated experiences will continue to set us apart.\nAs I look to close my remarks for the call, I want to reaffirm our guidance for the year, reflecting my optimism for our future, even while recognizing we are operating in a challenging environment.\nI have great confidence in our leadership team and our partners as we carry on this journey together. We continue to build our plans for the medium to long term to recognize our limitless long-term growth potential. I could not be more excited, nor more grateful for the opportunity to build upon Starbucks' iconic legacy and shepherd in a new era for the company. With that, I'll now turn it over to Rachel to discuss our Q2 fiscal year 2023 results in greater detail. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Laxman, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm so proud to discuss our outstanding Q2 performance, underscoring strength in both top line and margin globally. We delivered double-digit comp in all company-operated markets, excluding China, as well as positive comp in China driven by better-than-expected recovery, and saw continued strength in our licensed markets. This momentum was made possible by the investments we are making in our stores and partners and allowed us to continue unlocking capital to reinvest in our business.\nAs a result, our business and brand remain strong. As we begin on this next step in our journey, I'm confident that our execution against our Reinvention plan and broader strategies will progress us into our new era.\nOur Q2 consolidated revenues reached $8.7 billion, slightly above our Q1 level and up 14% from the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2% impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 11% comparable sales growth, 6% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, as well as continued momentum in our global licensed markets. This is remarkable performance on every level, but specifically given the seasonality pressures we typically experience in Q2.\nQ2 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 14.3%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, including better-than-expected recovery in China, pricing, productivity improvement, and lapping prior-year COVID-related pay. The margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners, higher G&A costs, and support of reinvention and inflation. Q2 EP S was $0.74, up 25% from the prior year.\nIn addition to our strong global performance and better-than-expected recovery in China, this also includes an approximately $0.03 of one-time benefit from Starbucks Rewards redemption tier changes in North America, which reduced the related liabilities. I will now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $6.4 billion in Q2, another quarterly record and up 17% from the prior year.\nThe growth was primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 5% growth in transactions and average ticket, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year, further strengthened by the continued momentum of our licensed store business. The segment's outstanding performance was led by the US, posting 12% comp in Q2 with transaction and ticket equally contributing to the growth, also bolstered by lapping the Omicron variant of COVID in the prior year.\nRemarkably, store traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels in our busiest day parts. And even with higher levels of beverage customization and complexity, we were able to serve the surge in traffic as we unlocked incremental store capacity through reinvention. Starbucks Rewards tender reached a record 57% of US company-operated sales in the quarter, showcasing customer loyalty and connection, and indicating a successful launch of the changes to our star redemption tiers.\nWe also continue to expand our store footprint across the US, reaching over 9,300 stores, with stores opened in the last few years driving nearly 50% cash-on-cash returns despite the inflationary environment. As part of our development strategy, we are committed to enhancing sustainability through Greener Stores, with the program saving almost $60 million in annual operating costs in the US alone through water savings and energy reduction when compared to historic store practices.\nOur runway of growth, coupled with store-level cash returns and commitment to sustainability, is exceptional for a company of our scale, contributing meaningfully to our robust capital position and ability to continue reinvesting in our business. US licensed store revenue sustained its momentum this quarter, up 25% from the prior year, with strength across the portfolio and further supported by the rollout of Starbucks Connect, as Laxman spoke about earlier, broadening our opportunity to reach our customers through our expanding network of stores\n. North America's operating margin was 19.2% in Q2, expanding 200 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by pricing, sales leverage, productivity improvement, and lapping prior-year COVID-related pay, partially offset by store partner investments and inflation.\nAs you heard at the top of the call, we are already seeing our Reinvention plan come to life, whether it's through improved partner turnover and engagement, a better customer experience, or productivity, or amplifying efforts fueled margin growth in the quarter. A margin benefit of approximately 60 basis points was also captured in the quarter due to the reevaluation of our Starbucks Rewards liability, which will not reoccur in the balance of the year. Moving on to international, the segment delivered revenue of $1.9 billion in the quarter, also a Q2 record and up 9% from the prior year.\nWhen excluding a 10% impact from foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 19%, reflecting double-digit growth in all major markets, including China.\nThe growth was driven by strength across our licensed businesses, a 10% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, and a 7% increase in comparable store sales from transactions. Our international markets across the globe continue to demonstrate strong momentum. Excluding China, the segment's Q2 revenue grew 14% from the prior year, or up 25% when excluding an 11% impact of foreign currency translation. Once again, our international markets, excluding China, collectively achieved double-digit comp growth, driven largely by transactions.\nLet me highlight the incredible performance of Japan this quarter, our third-largest market globally, which surpassed 1,800 stores and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp in Q2, as Laxman mentioned earlier. The market also upleveled its Star Rewards program through the introduction of a multi-tier redemption system designed to offer more customer choices and elevate the program economics.\nSubsequent to the quarter in April, Japan also became the third global market to introduce Oleato beverages, offering the innovative lineup at more than 60 of their select stores, including the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo. While still early, our performance in this market, a market that embraces innovation, appears promising. Shifting to China, China posted comp growth of 3% in Q2, meaningfully exceeding our expectations, including 30% comp growth in March as we began lapping heightened mobility restrictions in the prior year.\nFrom the early weeks of January, when China emerged from peak infections and mobility restrictions were lifted in different cities, we saw broad-based recovery across all trade zones, day parts, and city tiers. This was fueled by a strong rebound in traffic as customers returned physically to our stores to enjoy moments of reconnection.\nStarbucks Rewards active members rebounded 17.8 million by the end of Q2 and hit a new record high by the first week of Q3. The sharp, immediate rebound in traffic demonstrated the strength of our brand and the relationships we have built with customers, as well as our strong operating muscle to capture the pent-up demand, all of which drove rapid improvement in average weekly sales in Q2. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, the speed of recovery in terms of average weekly sales will moderate after the faster-than-expected rebound achieved in Q2.\nFor the remainder of the fiscal year, we will continue to face uncertainties such as changes in customer behaviors and the pace of international travel recovery as COVID in China enters a new endemic phase. Nevertheless, we feel confident Starbucks is well-positioned for this next phase of recovery.\nOperating margin for the international segment was 17% in Q2, expanding 390 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage across markets, but specifically driven by the better-than-expected recovery in China, partially offset by higher store partner wages and benefits. Shifting to channel development, the segment's revenue grew 4% from the prior year to 481 million in Q2, in line with our expectations, driven primarily by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Global channel development extends customer occasions beyond our stores to amplify and diversify the Starbucks presence around the world.\nOur newer at-home platforms, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers, continue to drive growth for the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain the market leader in global ready-to-drink categories, with North American Coffee Partnership outgrowing the category and continuing to gain share for the past two quarters in a row.\nThe North American Coffee Partnership shall share gains across platforms, and we're excited about our robust pipeline of innovations. To name a few, we launched Frappuccino Mini Cans in late March to bring a perfect-sized treat to our consumers. We're also elevating our portfolio with bottled Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink, which were inspired by popular handcrafted beverages in our stores and just hit store shelves in April. The segment's operating margin was 35.6% in Q2, down 710 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets in mixed shift.\nExcluding the impairment, the segment's margin was nearly 40% for the quarter, and we continue to expect channel development's margin to normalize in the mid-40s range towards the end of the year. Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2023.\nAs Laxman discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal year, balancing our incredible momentum and optimism with the economic uncertainties we continue to face around the world. Let me provide some additional insights on our outlook. First, in the US, a meaningful part of the 12% comp in the quarter reflected a lap of Omicron in the earlier part of the quarter, which was incorporated into our original guidance for Q2. US comp has normalized as anticipated in March and into Q3, with expected annual comp continuing to be in the guidance range of 7% to 9%.\nSecond, similar to comp, our Q2 North America margin also benefited from lapping a sizable amount of COVID pay in relation to Omicron, accounting for 120 basis points of year-over-year expansion, as well as Starbucks Rewards tier change impact of 60 basis points, which are not expected to recur in the balance of the year. Third, as I discussed earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to sequentially grow in Q3 and Q4, but at a more moderate pace.\nAcknowledging the uncertain environment, we expect China comp to improve in the back half of the year, driven in large part by the lap of mobility restrictions in Q3 of the prior year, coupled with the continued recovery leading to low to mid-single-digit comp on a full-year basis. Lastly, although China's Q2 margin was also stronger than expected, it benefited from the timing of certain investments.\nAs we continue to ramp our operations in the balance of the year, we plan to resume investments required to drive sustainable growth over the long term. Further, here are some points of clarification on guidance. Regarding the shape of margin, we continue to expect sequential margin improvement in both Q3 and Q4. We expect Q3 margin near the prior-year level, with Q4 expanding meaningfully over prior-year as we lap the significant investments in wages and benefits. Note the quarterly margin shape in Q3 and Q4 is not expected to mirror the prior year. We also expect EP S to step up in the second half of the fiscal year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4.\nWe expect year-over-year EP S growth in Q3 to be meaningfully lower than our fiscal year guidance range of 15% to 20%, with Q4 year-over-year EP S growth slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our Reinvention plan, as well as inflationary pressures, which are moderating. We continue to expect our G&A growth to be outsized in fiscal year 2023. A large portion of the G&A growth will reflect critical technology investments, which we believe will fuel our reinvention and business growth.\nImportantly, as we conclude the first half of the fiscal year, our global performance is closely tracking to our original expectations as the significant unexpected headwinds in China were offset by strong performance in the US and the rest of the world.\nWhile we continue to navigate our path to recovery in China, coupled with the heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we are confident that the reinvention investments we are making in our partners, stores, and customers will continue to guide our growth, delivering on our original fiscal 2023 outlook. Lastly, despite the current interest rate environment, our balance sheet remains very healthy, supported by our strong cash flows and a measured financial policy targeting leverage below three times least suggested debt to EBITDA.\nWe are in an enviable position to continue to invest in our business, deliver on our shareholder return commitments, and retain financial flexibility in the face of current economic uncertainty. In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. One, our global business and brand remains strong, demonstrated by both top line and margin performance in Q2.\nWe are brewing on all cylinders across our building blocks of growth, namely strong comp propelled by digital engagement, unrivaled innovation, and engaged partners, store growth anchored by best-in-class cash returns and margin uplifted by reinvention as it continues to gain traction. Two, our fiscal year guidance remains unchanged, balancing our optimism with the economic uncertainties around the world. And finally, our new era is coming to life as we continue unlocking capacity and driving capital returns through reinvention.\nThe investments being fused into our business are centering us on our core while increasing differentiation and building resiliency to help us realize our limitless future. Before I close, I want to express my deep appreciation for our partners around the world, especially our Green Apron partners, for the critical role they played in achieving our success this quarter.\nOur future rests on the shoulders of many, and it's our collective unwavering commitment to serve our partners, customers, and all of those from farm to cup in the best way possible to allow Starbucks to deliver on our limitless possibilities. With that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan. Hi, thank you very much. The question is on the US staffing environment, specifically the store-level partners.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nIt seems like that's where some of the biggest opportunity might really remain for this company going forward. I don't think I need to review second half of 2021, Great Resignation, your own specific challenges with labor. Obviously, a lot of news that was probably bigger than some of the labor issues even at the stores themselves. I was really wondering where that left us in terms of staffing levels, hiring practices, training, and retention, how you view the overall quality of the labor force.\nAnd I guess, really importantly, how the current staffing and partner environment is being reflected in terms of overall customer service, in terms of the customer satisfaction and speed. So if we can just spend a couple of minutes on how you see the current staffing environment and the opportunity maybe over the next year. Thank you.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nHey, John, thank you for your question.\nFirstly, I will give a bit of an overview, and then I'll call on Frank and Sara to provide their perspectives. Firstly, Starbucks continues to be a brand with a very strong employee value proposition, and we are able to attract a lot of applicants for the jobs that we have open. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing growing stabilization in what we see in our front line. As I mentioned, we are seeing lower levels of attrition and greater stabilization in our retail talent. Additionally, as you look at the improvements that we are making in our scheduling processes, we're able to deliver an average hours per week to our partners of 4% higher at this point in time.\nThat, of course, does matter because it does have an implication on the compensation that they have. There are clearly more things in the pipeline as well.\nAnd Frank, I'd love for you to give your comments on how you see the environment there.\n\nFrank Brit\n\nEVP and CSO, Starbucks\n\nYeah, it is clearly an acute labor market environment, and we are mindful of that. We have continued, however, to build on Lax's points to distinguish ourselves as a preferred employer of choice for frontline workforces. We view that through the lens of how do we create value for the partner as we continue to partner in building the company together.\nSpecifically in scheduling, we see scheduling as a significant opportunity as we continue to contour hours by store and by day part, and ultimately in service of getting our partners what their needs are relative to the shift they would like to see week to week, as well as the hours they need week to week in service of their goals professionally and otherwise.\nAnd then finally, I would say that we have a very robust agenda to continue programmatically improving the partner experience. We can unpack some of the specifics on that, but this is part of the ongoing agenda for reinvention. We feel pleased with our progress, but we feel like there's a significant opportunity to continue to create even more opportunities for them in their careers.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nSara, any comments from your time in stores?\n\nSara Trilling\n\nEVP and President, Starbucks\n\nI would just give one overlay. In addition to what's already been discussed, we've put a tremendous amount of effort over the last quarter in bringing our teams together in formats that allow them to celebrate our mission, to build capability, and it's paying off in terms of their engagement with the company. So that's one.\nIn fact, just last week and this week, we've got partners gathering to focus at the store level all around connection and driving a different level of customer connection and customer service. I would also say that the investments that we've made in really the core of our business, notably coffee and the way that we're celebrating our Black Apron partners, we're investing in partners going to origin, and just more training to build competency around craft, is also another area that's driving engagement with our partners at the store level. And lastly, community, which is something that our partners care deeply about.\nWe wrapped up our April month of service. And again, that was a great way to help our partners feel connected to something bigger and with mission and values at the heart of it.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nIf I can add one more thing, I think we're seeing strong pickup in the program of tipping that we have scaled across our store network.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Great.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the strength of the quarter, maybe in the context of other comments about both the near-term and long-term outlook. So it sounds like there was significant upside to your own expectations for the quarter and objectively very strong, but you're not raising full your guidance, which makes me wonder if maybe your reinvention path is going to be higher than you had previously anticipated, just because some of the things Rachel mentioned, the COVID laps, I think, would have been embedded in the outlook initially.\nAnd maybe in that same vein, Laxman's view that you're reinventing or refounding the brand, not something I would typically associate with a brand that's putting up the kind of performance that we saw in the Q2. So if you could just contextualize the strength of the quarter in your full year outlook and also the view about the brand going forward. Thanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nRachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nSure. Thanks, Sara. The way I'd look at it is we were incredibly pleased with the performance in Q2. But when you think about, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we benefited from the lap of Omicron as well as the one-time adjustment from the star liability. That was expected. So we expected that, and that was driven in the comp that we saw in the quarter in North America as well as broadly.\nBut in addition to that, while we recovered better than what we expected in China, when we look out towards the balance of the year, we expect our average weekly sales in China to continue and increase to improve sequentially quarter over quarter, but at a more moderate pace than what we saw in Q2. And we've already seen it start to moderate. And that's really driven by the fact that there's still some uncertainty in the overall environment from a recovery standpoint, when you look at things like consumer behavior as well as recovery in key segments like our international travel.\nSo when we take all of that into account, when we look at our guidance for the full year, we believe reaffirming our guidance allows us to continue to convey the momentum, but also the confidence we have while still navigating a rather uncertain environment globally.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nYour next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeffrey Berstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclay\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just looking out beyond this year, Rachel or Laxman, I'm just wondering how you think about the operating margins in the coming years, maybe framing it relative to pre-COVID levels. Back in the day, high teens were the norm. I'm just wondering whether that's still a realistic target, and if so, maybe by when, or perhaps Laxman, that's just no longer the focus, or it's just not necessarily attainable based on the outsized inflation and ongoing investments you're making in the business. Just wondering how you think about the top versus the bottom line balance there. Thanks very much.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nI think in terms of guidance on this call, our focus is entirely on this year. We are confirming our guidance for this year.\nI think, as I mentioned earlier, as I've gone through the immersion and I've worked in various parts of the company, there's no question what we see is we see headroom in terms of our top line. We also see opportunities for us to improve margins over time. I gave a couple of examples in the prepared remarks about things that were apparent. We can buy different, and we can buy better. Our end-to-end supply chain is significant opportunities to reduce cost and improve availability. We can enhance our tech stack both to lower cost and then actually reinvest it back in the tech stack to support the large digital push that we are making.\nOur stores need to better reflect what is needed to meet the evolved demand from where they were initially designed. Our beverage innovation is strong. Food could use more work.\nAnd our innovation could be more purposeful and targeted. And these are the kinds of opportunities that I mentioned are the opportunities in the factory in the back. We also have opportunities in the theater in the front. So I think as you look at it, clearly there's top-line headroom, and there's opportunities to sequentially improve margins. But in this call, we are focused entirely on confirming our guidance for this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from David Palmer at Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I wanted to get your take on the China market and your messaging there. Your four-year trend versus pre-COVID levels, you're 24% below where China's same-store sales would have been in this last quarter. And just doing the math on your commentary for the year, it would appear that your same-store sales would still be roughly that amount below pre-COVID levels.\nSo the recovery would be kind of stalling out if we just assumed that low to mid-single-digit comp for the year. So I know you said a lot about China, but I'm wondering what is the thought process behind that sort of sales, and what color can you give behind it? Thanks.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nRachel, and then I'll call on Belinda for some commentary. Sure.Thanks, David. I think as we look at the remainder of the year for China, as I had shared previously, we expect that our average weekly sales will continue to improve sequentially quarter over quarter. We also expect that our comp will improve, especially as we lap the mobility restrictions from prior year.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks",
    "content2": "But when you think about the overall environment, while we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing strong traffic in afternoon day parts as well as on our weekends, which just speaks to a customer need to connect, there's still a lot happening in terms of the overall environment as it relates to recovery. And so when we put all of that together and we think about that, when we look to the balance of the year, we expect it to continue to improve, but at a more moderate pace relative to what we saw in Q2.\nAnd that's what brings us to the full-year guidance range of a low to mid-single-digit comp, which I think when you look at that, does reflect momentum, but it also reflects confidence, especially when you look at last year. We ended the year with a negative 24% comp on a full-year basis and a negative 25% and 9% even more recently in our last quarter. So that's how we're thinking about the recovery. We're very encouraged by many of the signs that we see, but there's a lot that we're navigating. And so we feel very good about the guidance we've given as we think about the back half of the year.\nThat'll turn it over to Belinda.\n\nBelinda Wong\n\nChairwoman, Starbucks\n\nThank you. I'll just provide some colors on our recovery. China has finally turned a new chapter from pandemic to endemic.\nQ2 marks the start of our solid and broad recovery, and it's only the beginning. We see strong rebound in traffic, as Rachel said, back to our stores for reconnection and the Third Place experience our customers have long craved. We're best positioned for this moment because we're in a human connection business. Our unique Third Place and the Starbucks experience cannot be replicated anywhere else. We achieved 30% comp in March, and the strong momentum continues in Q3. We're firing on all cylinders to accelerate our top-line and bottom-line growth for balance of the year and beyond.\nWe will leverage our market-leading store portfolio to capture the pent-up demand for reconnection, and we are ready to accelerate even faster our new store growth in the second half of the year.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nOur evolving omnichannel capability, the strength of our delivery business, our Mobile Order and Pay and e-commerce, all built in the past few years and ready to serve our customers for any occasion, anywhere, and anytime. Highly incremental. In fact, our Mobile Order and Pay business achieved the highest record sales in mix of 24% in Q2. We built strong operating muscle and agility to innovate and execute. We have the ability to adapt further with speed to meet new customer needs with disciplined execution in stores.\nThe enduring power and strength of the Starbucks brand and the deep connection we have with our customers and partners are second to none. With that, our 60,000 partners in China are ready to capture the exciting growth ahead. Thank you.\nYour next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Siren System.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director, BTIG\n\nLaxman, I think you mentioned it briefly, but really didn't provide a lot more color on it. I know this was something you guys talked about in great detail at the investor day in the fall. Just curious if you could give us an update on the testing and rollout of this system and the impact you're expecting going forward.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you for your question. I feel very good about the progress that we're making on the equipment rollout as well as the testing that is underway on the Siren System. As you see, some of the nearer-term equipment launches have happened and have landed on time. We have a very systematic approach to how we think about our equipment and the testing that we're doing. I feel very good about the progress we are making on that system. So all systems go as far as we're concerned.\nSara, I wondered whether you wanted to touch a little bit on some of the equipment launches that we've had so far.\n\nSara Trilling\n\nEVP and President, Starbucks\n\nYes. Thank you. Happy to. I mean, specific to Siren System, Laxman, as you said, cold beverage as well as the food station, incubation tests are complete, and feasibility begins in Q3, right, for the rollout. And I think both of which these stations have already shown measurable impact on both productivity as well as throughput and testing. So we're quite bullish on them. And then overall, absolutely. We're already seeing the benefits of the investments that we've made in equipment. We're serving more customers during our busiest day parts than we did pre-pandemic.\nAnd when I'm out in stores, I certainly hear firsthand from our partners how the equipment is making the work easier. And it's evident in speed with service.\nYou can see it in our drive-through times, and you can also see it, importantly, in our productivity numbers. As we're thinking about summer and the weather is warming up around the country, some of the things that we've launched more recently, called bold blenders as well as labor hours at that station specifically, make it easier to serve customers and enable the innovation that's going to be coming. The last piece I'd call out that we're really excited about as it relates to our core, again, coffee is Clover Vertica.\nWe all know waste and throughput are going to be. They're going to benefit favorably. But I think more important, we're putting coffee at the center. Our partners are incredibly enthusiastic about the offering that we'll give to our customers and the pride, right, that they'll feel in terms of the quality that's in the cup.\nSo very, very excited about that one as well.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThat's great, Sara. Thanks, Frank, for the comment.\n\nFrank Brit\n\nEVP and CSO, Starbucks\n\nYes, Sara, you mentioned productivity. I think it's probably worth highlighting that while we typically see a decline in productivity during winter months due to seasonality and volume within our stores, compared to last year, we've seen a sustainment of strong IPLH, our proxy for productivity. And I think this affirms, to your point, Sara, the alchemy of partner changes in store workflow and equipment, all yielding tangible value and enduring value for our partners and for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The last question comes from Lauren Silberman, Credit Suisse.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you for the question and congrats. Really strong US comps and traffic. Can you help unpack where the growth's coming from? So is traffic primarily coming from new customers or existing customers, Rewards members, or more occasional customers?\nAnd then can you just give us an update on where you're running with transactions per store per day? Thank you very much.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nGreat. Let me start with Brady. I think I'd love for you to give your perspectives on the questions, please.\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nEVP and CMO, Starbucks\n\nSure. Yeah. In the quarter, you saw in the US business an equal part in the comp between transaction comp and ticket comp. Of course, we were overlapping some bad weather last year, some Omicron surge. But really, when we look under the surface of that too, as Rachel shared in her opening remarks, record customer counts for the quarter. When we look year over year, that we saw growth there, transaction comps growing in our busiest day parts. And when we get underneath the hood of that, it's really brand strength. We have growing affinity for the Starbucks brand.\nWe saw some very good highs within the quarter for brand affinity. We look at the relevance of the innovation. So our Iced Shaken Espresso platform continuing to grow, our Refreshers platform continuing to grow, which just reinforces our cold customized plant-based beverage strategy is just yielding continued growth. You heard Laxman talk about Pistachio Cream Cold Brew. We launched Oleato in the quarter. So there's so much for customers to be excited about and giving them a reason to come to Starbucks. And then lastly, I would just say the execution. You see our Starbucks Rewards membership, rewarding Starbucks for that with more of their visits. Now, 57% of US transactions are from our Rewards members.\nAnd what they're telling us is, as you heard me say before, they are finding a beverage they can't get anywhere else.\nAnd so all of those things compile into a great force of momentum for Starbucks. And we continue to be a strong brand that's poised for growth in the future, so.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nEVP and CFO, Starbucks\n\nAnd I would just add, Lauren, to that, that you had asked about TSDs. And we have seen our TSDs grow relative to pre-COVID levels. In fact, in our busiest day part, our morning day part, we have surpassed our pre-COVID levels. And that's in large part due to the momentum we're seeing in our reinvention. We're able to unlock capacity and better serve our customers. And we're seeing that come to fruition in terms of our overall strength in TSDs, which is also increasing in the early part of our afternoon. So we're encouraged by that.\nThat's leading to, when Brady talked about the customer count, the growth we had in customer count. That's really across both our SR members as well as our non-SR members. So our overall customer count is increasing. Those customers are more engaged with our brand. And we see that in terms of unit growth as well as increasing transactions. And then overall ticket leading to the second highest average weekly sales that we've seen, second only to last quarter, which was an all-time high. So we're incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing from an overall volume standpoint.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nCEO, Starbucks\n\nThank you, Rachel. I'm very pleased with the results of this quarter. We are clearly moving with momentum as a business. There's clearly further opportunities for us and for this wonderful brand. It's a privilege to lead it.\nI want to thank you all for joining us today for our Q2 fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your investment and your time. Thank you. With that, we conclude today's conference call. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great evening."

My name is Diego, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVP of Head of IR, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Diego, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Starbucks' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 results. Today's discussion will be led by Howard Schultz, Interim Chief Executive Officer; Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And for Q&A, we'll be joined by Frank Britt, Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer; Sara Trilling, Executive Vice President and President of Starbucks North America; Michael Conway, Group President of International and Channel Development; and Belinda Wong, Chairwoman of Starbucks China, who is joining us today from on the ground in China.\nThis conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

Now before I turn the call over, let me first say thank you to Howard. Because in our short amount of time together, I have witnessed a relentless focus on our culture while not compromising results. You have reinforced the importance of dreaming bigger than others may even think is possible. And for that, I will forever be grateful. And so now the floor is yours, Howard.\n\nHoward D. Schultz\n\nFounder, Interim CEO & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. I did not expect that. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to comment on the strong financial and operating results Starbucks reported today, highlighted by record quarterly sales of $8.7 billion, up 8% over last year, up 12%, excluding foreign exchange, a stunning 10% comp growth in the U.S. and North America, 5% comp growth globally. And except for China, very strong sales and comp growth in every international market we are in.\nWe posted strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a softer quarter for retail overall and an unprecedented COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China. Credit belongs to our partners around the world, who continue to successfully satisfy record demand in our stores while delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers. In China, COVID-related mobility restrictions and a spike in COVID infections following the end of zero COVID resulted in comp sales of minus 29% for the quarter, 4x worse than what we expected.\nWeak sales combined with the cost to support the health, the safety and well-being of our partners, our first priority, negatively impacted total company earnings by $0.06, resulting in Q1 EPS of $0.75 per share. Despite short-term headwinds, we are confident that the end of zero COVID marks the beginning of China's emergence from 3 years of pandemic, puts the country on a path to reintroducing normalcy and routine back into people's lives and positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth.\nWe also believe that the end of zero COVID will enable renewed consumer activity in China and recovery of our business in the back half of fiscal 2023. Our view is informed by patterns of post-COVID behaviors we have seen in countries around the world as consumer activity accelerates as years of pent-up demand is released. Today, our stores in China are again open without restriction and our partners are back at work. Many have been infected and recovered from COVID.\nNoteworthy is that we saw a meaningful sequential improvement in sales and traffic as we move through January as people began resuming aspects of their pre-COVID lives, including gradually returning to our stores. More on China shortly. Our performance in Q1 underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people in extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in relevant innovation that, together, are driving sales and transaction growth around the world.\nStarbucks is more relevant globally today than ever before in our history, ideally positioning us to successfully execute our ambitious growth agenda and have roughly 45,000 stores delivering best-in-class returns around the world by the end of fiscal 2025. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our performance in Q1 and provide an update on the progress of our reinvention initiatives.\nI will then provide granular details specifically around the shape of our business in China and shine a bright light on the positive correlation between increases in consumer activity in China and the recovery of our business. Next, Brady will detail the beverage, food, mobile, digital and store innovation that drove record demand for Starbucks Coffee in every market outside of China in Q1. And he will speak to our record holiday performance, the strong growth in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership sequentially and year-over-year and the extraordinary record of $3.3 billion loaded on cards and gifted in the U.S.\nWe entered Q1 with roughly $2 billion globally waiting to be spent in our stores, increased Starbucks Rewards membership and card loads serve as both a current annuity and the future driver of our business. And then finally, Rachel will highlight our Q1 financial and operating performance and speak to the confidence we have in our full year 2023 guidance despite the significant impact from China, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nLet me begin with North America. The record demand for Starbucks Coffee in North America we've reported on our Q4 call accelerated in Q1 and through holiday. Despite the difficult operating environment that most retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar retailers experienced in the quarter. Average weekly sales in the U.S. company-operated stores reached a record high in Q1, exceeding the prior record set in Q4 of fiscal '22.\nThis is -- this next line, I think, is just -- even when I read it, I'm surprised, with 8 of the 10 highest sales days in our history recorded in the quarter. Consistently strong demand drove revenues up 14% to a quarterly record of $6.6 billion and a comp sale of 10% over last year. And Q1 momentum has continued in Q2. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S., exiting Q1, totaled over 30 million members, up 4 million members or 15% over last year and up 6% sequentially.\nLoyal Starbucks Reward members drove a record 56% of tender, up 3% from last year, reflecting increased customer engagement throughout our system. Our convenience channels, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery continue to fuel our business, delivering 72% of U.S. revenue in Q1. We continue to add high returning drive-throughs that attract new customers, expand our footprint and drive new customer occasions. Our over 6,600 store U.S. license business posted similar strong results with 32% revenue growth and double-digit comps across all operating segments.\nWhat's interesting to me is while grocery retailers are representative segment, within our licensed business, experienced traffic and spend-related headwinds across their store base in Q1, their Starbucks business proved to be the bright spot, bringing incremental traffic into their stores and driving sales for us as well. We continued to roll out Starbucks Connect, enabling licensed stores to offer all Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits, expanding the value offering we provide our customers and licensees and enabling us to capture demand across our broader store portfolio. Starbucks Connect is proving to be highly incremental, and we see great upside for it.\nCross-functional teams continue to successfully execute against our reinvention initiatives and our reinvention investments are having a measurable positive impact on our business, evidenced by an 8% improvement in U.S. hourly retail partner turnover. Improved turnover correlates to more stable store environments, elimination of new hire-related costs, particularly training, and measurable improvements in productivity, speed of service and partner and customer experience scores that we're already seeing.\nOur Q1 performance demonstrates that our reinvention plan investments are the right investments that we are making and are delivering results and creating shareholder value, providing us with tremendous confidence in the revenue, margin and EPS expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. Let me turn to international. Outside of China, the momentum we saw in our International segment exiting Q4 continued in Q1. Excluding China and foreign currency translation, revenues for the quarter are up 25% and comps were up 11%, fueled by recovery consumption in Japan and a rebound in tourism activity across our EMEA markets, following the lift of COVID restrictions.\nOne great example is Alshaya. Alshaya is our license partner in the Middle East for the last 23 years and among our largest international licensees with over 1,800 stores across 13 markets. They reported their strongest quarter with the Starbucks brand ever in Q1. We added 370 new stores in international in Q1 and now operate 18,700 stores across 84 markets, 43% company-operated and 57% licensed.\nStrong growth in our international license business reflects the outside returns the Starbucks brand delivers to our licensees, driving increased investment by our licensees in our business and growing customer engagement with our Starbucks brand around the world.\nTurning to channel development. The Starbucks brand relevant innovation and seasonal moments are resonating with our customers and driving sales and occasions around the world, resulting in a 15% increase in channel revenues in Q1 over last year to $478 million.\nWe continue to hold the #1 dollar share in U.S. at-home coffee and in Q1 outpaced dollar sales growth in North America ready-to-drink category overall, again demonstrating the unique power of the Starbucks brand. In China, Starbucks received the ready-to-drink New Product Launch of the Year award for the introduction of Bottled Frappuccino oat latte.\nWe will continue to delight our customers with exciting new beverage innovation in the months ahead, including with the launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink Pink Drink inspired by the overwhelming success of Pink Drinks served in our retail stores and certain to become a customer favorite, especially with our young customers and our Gen Z audience.\nLet me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China now for over 24 years, and that our confidence in the future of Starbucks business in China and our aspirations for the market and our partners has never been greater. We exited Q1 with almost 6,100 Starbucks stores across 240 cities, and our newest class of stores continue despite the challenges we've had to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability.\nAnd we remain on plan to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025. Our belief in China is based on our leadership position in the market, our relationship with our partners and the trust that we have among our Chinese customers and the market and our brand position.\nSince 2020, our Starbucks China team has been navigating the most acute COVID-related mobility restrictions and disruptions anywhere in the world, while at the same time, developing the flexibility to execute under any COVID scenario. By leading in together, in service of their customers and fellow partners, our China team has navigated every challenge obstacle and volatility that COVID had put in their way, building more capability, flexibility and operating muscle with each unexpected test.\nThat flexibility and operating muscle, coupled with deliberate investments that we've made throughout the pandemic, supported our business in Q1 and will increasingly drive efficiency, productivity, profitability and shareholder value, and enable us to deliver an even more relevant and elevated Starbucks experience to our partners and our customers in the years ahead.\nAs I shared on our last call, our recovery in China gained momentum in Q4 of 2022 despite severe mobility restrictions in many of our larger cities. We saw sequential improvement in all key operating metrics driven by the success of mobile and digital technology investments and expanded delivery capabilities built during COVID that made it easier for our customers to engage with us and better enable us to serve them. The direct positive correlation we saw between increased consumer activity in China and sales in our stores and the speed and consistency with which our business was accelerating, gave us great confidence moving through the quarter.\nHowever, in September, a new wave of COVID spiked resulting in further increased mobility restrictions, new mobile, digital and delivery capabilities enabled us to partially offset the reduction in store traffic in September. However, in early December, zero COVID was lifted and COVID infection spiked across China, resulting in a dramatic decline in consumer activity across the country and causing the most severe COVID disruptions any retailer had encountered.\nFor us, at its peak, nearly 1,800 Starbucks stores were closed during that month. As a result, comps in Q1 declined 29% with a 42% comp decline in December alone. But like consumers everywhere, our customers in China are creating a full return to familiar pre-COVID routines and lifestyles. And huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed. Early indications are that it is beginning to happen in our largest cities now with many Chinese recovered from COVID, people returning to work, border and travel restrictions lifted, mall traffic and retail store activity on the rise and consumers reintroducing social activity back into their daily lives.\nWe saw the strongest level of sustained customer activity we've seen in years in the run-up to and during Chinese New Year festivities. As Rachel will share, we are expecting the second half of fiscal 2023 in China to be stronger than the first half. But uncertainties remain and the better part of valor is to remain cautious around precisely when our recovery in China will take full flight. However, when it does, pattern recognition, the return on pre-COVID routines and the adoption of new post-COVID routines will become self-evident in China. And customers will flock to Starbucks stores to enjoy moments of reconnection, their favorite Starbucks beverages and the premium Starbucks experience our partners in China deliver. And Q1 headwinds will shift to tailwinds. We've seen this pattern repeat in markets around the world, including the United States.\nDespite the challenges and the uncertainties of the last 3 years, Starbucks' commitment to China and to our partners and business in China has never wavered. Almost 25 years after entering the market, I remain more confident than ever that we are still only in the early chapters of our growth story in China. And I'm looking forward to being with our China partners for the first time in years when I visit the country this spring.\nLaxman's immersion continues to go spectacularly well. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more about our company and business and wins the hearts and minds of Starbucks partners everywhere. Only weeks from now, Lax will take full control of the company and, together with our leadership team, bring reinvention to life, guide Starbucks into a new era of growth and begin writing the next chapters of our storied history. I cannot be more confident that Lax is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks.\nAnd Starbucks Coffee Company domestically and around the world is in great hands with him as the CEO. This, my last earnings call, is very special for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life at Starbucks.\nIt was 1983, walking the beautiful streets of Milan that the inspiration for what Starbucks could one day be and mean first struck me. 40 years later, I'm not sure where the years have gone. 40 years later, we have over 36,000 stores around the world, serving over 100 million customers each week. Along the way, we have created opportunity, cared for and improve the lives of millions of Starbucks partners and made progress against my goal of creating a different kind of company, a company steeped in humanity, humility and respect, where everyone is welcome, and we embrace the belief that our differences make us better and stronger.\nAnd a company unlike any company my father ever got a chance to work for, but there's much more opportunity and much more work ahead. Finally, while Starbucks has launched many successful coffee beverages over the years, my Starbucks journey will come full circle when I return to Milan later this month to introduce something much bigger than any new promotion or beverage. While I was in Italy last summer, I discovered an enduring, transformative new category and platform for the company, unlike anything I had ever experienced.\nThe word I would use to describe it without giving too much away is alchemy. We won't unveil details today, but it will be a game changer, so standby. Many people have asked me if my final earnings call as Starbucks CEO is bitter sweet, it really isn't. Starbucks business and brand, the quality of our coffee, the relevance of the Starbucks partner and customer experiences have defined us since our founding in 1971 and have never been better or stronger.\nAnd our future has never been brighter. It will be my pleasure to take a front-row seat as Laxman leads Starbucks into and through the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady.\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. I know I speak for so many when I say thank you for your relentless pursuit of elevating the Starbucks customer and partner experience. Your leadership to our reinvention has us well positioned to continue advancing towards our biggest aspirations with Laxman and our strengthened leadership team.\nGood afternoon, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of our strong Q1 performance across all markets. Today, I'll focus on what we saw in the U.S. this quarter. In addition to the strong customer demand for Starbucks overall, our results benefited from last year's strategic pricing actions and increased food attached with record sales for both Sous Vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches.\nOur product portfolio and innovations continue to resonate with customers, especially our cold, customized beverage innovation. Beverage sales increased 13%, led by our strength in the espresso category, with featured holiday beverages like the Caramel BrulÃ©e Latte and Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte contributing to growth. Customized beverages continue to be a differentiator with customers all year long. Modifier sales were up 28% year-over-year in our U.S. company-operated stores, showing that customers are visiting Starbucks for beverages customized to their preferences that they cannot find anywhere else.\nThe strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand continued to accelerate this holiday season as we surpassed, as Howard said, 30 million active Starbucks Rewards members. We drove record-breaking mobile order usage at 27% of transactions in the U.S. company-operated stores, and we reached an all-time high in the population of our weekly total active customer base. We also saw more than $3.3 billion loaded on Starbucks cards in the U.S., exceeding last year's record results and setting a new record.\nIn fact, our gifting business was so strong that the unit sales of Starbucks Cards were greater than the next 4 brands of gift cards combined. This not only drives new Starbucks Rewards registrations but it also drives our business in Q2 as evidenced by the high 56% Starbucks Reward tender that we saw in our U.S. company-operated stores at the end of the quarter. Said another way, during the holiday season, Starbucks truly becomes the currency of kindness and it drives our business.\nAt the heart of Starbucks is uplifting human connection. This is a core part of our reinvention, and we accelerated our reinvention investments in the quarter, driving continued improvement in our industry-leading partner retention. We're also committed to elevating the customer experience. And within the quarter, we launched our first Starbucks Rewards, Reward Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which offers members of both Delta SkyMiles and Starbucks Rewards, new ways to earn rewards.\nOn December 8, we also launched the Starbucks Rewards Odyssey experience in beta to select members. Odyssey members have been invited to partake in multiple Odyssey journeys, driving increased engagement and loyalty from our members and now ownership in their loyalty experience. We also announced the national expansion of our partnership with DoorDash, which, alongside Uber Eats, also provides us the ability to serve customers in a convenient way and enjoy Starbucks wherever they are. And we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards redemption tiers, which not only supports critical program growth and discount efficiencies, but it also allows us to add increasing value relevant to our members by making popular items like cold coffee, more attainable, a change that our members have praised.\nFinally, we're furthering the value delivered to our SR members by bringing them coffeehouse culture and content through a new series in the Starbucks app called the Starbucks daily, which will launch with [iHeart Radio] this month. In short, Starbucks is an incredibly strong brand and one that is poised for growth. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1 with nearly every business contributing to our strong performance. The remarkable strength in nearly all major markets and channels across the globe led to outperformance across our metrics when excluding the headwinds in China. Our Q1 consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion were another record quarterly high, up 8% from the prior year or 12% when excluding an approximately 3% impact of foreign currency translation.\nThe revenue growth was primarily driven by 5% comparable store sales growth; 5% net new store growth over the past 12 months; impressive momentum in our U.S. and international licensed stores as well as our channel development businesses. When excluding China and the impact from foreign currency translation, revenues in all 3 of our reporting segments continued to expand double digit, demonstrating the demand of our diverse portfolio and power of our innovation as we focus on our new era of growth.\nQ1 consolidated operating margin contracted 60 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, part of which represent the reinvention plan, inflation and deleverage in China. The contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. The deleverage in China was more significant than expected, while other margin drivers were largely in line with our original guidance.\nQ1 EPS was $0.75, up 4% from the prior year, including an approximate $0.06 dilutive impact from the headwinds in China relative to our original expectations. Although we anticipated China's recovery to be nonlinear, the headwinds in Q1 were larger than our prior estimate by approximately $0.06 due to the unforeseen changes in COVID restriction and infection spikes. The significant strength across our global portfolio, however, largely offset the impacts from China's performance, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal 2023 growth targets, as I'll discuss in a moment.\nFirst, I'll provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of all-time record revenue in Q1 of $6.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 9% increase in average ticket, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and very strong growth in our U.S. licensed store business. Our U.S. company-operated stores had a record revenue quarter with 10% comp growth in Q1, fueled by strength in digital, innovation and record holiday performance as both Howard and Brady shared. In addition to the continued strength in ticket, the number of unique customers grew 10%, setting another all-time record and further expanding our reach.\nLet me also highlight the very strong performance of U.S. licensed stores this quarter, which posted revenue growth in excess of 30% and 15% system comp growth over the prior year Q1 with strength across the portfolio. Performance was particularly strong in retail and travel as pre-COVID behavior normalcy returns, with U.S. licensed store revenue indexing at roughly 140% of pre-pandemic levels.\nGrocery also experienced strong growth, powered by the continued rollout of Starbucks Connect despite the overall decline in customer traffic across the rest of grocery store industry. North America's operating margin was 18.6% in Q1, contracting 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to previously committed investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and benefits as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nWhile Q1 operating margin declined sequentially from Q4 fiscal 2022, driven primarily by seasonal sales mix shift, we gained productivity through reinvention, including improved partner retention and equipment rollouts, paving the way for progressive margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal 2023 and years to come.\nMoving to international. The segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1, down 10% from the prior year or up 2% when excluding a nearly 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum across all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months.\nThe growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales, including a 29% decline in China. Although China posted a comp decline of 29% in Q1, the heaviest decline of 42% was experienced in December with pressure carrying into Q2, all of which was well below our original estimates, as mentioned in my opening. Just to give you a little color, at its peak, nearly 1,800 stores or close to 30% of our portfolio were temporarily closed due to sharp fall in traffic and labor shortage because of partners falling sick to COVID.\nOutside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe continued to outperform in Q1. Once again, these markets, together, achieved double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by transactions. Their revenue grew 25% in the quarter when excluding a 17% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation with successful holiday campaigns across all regions. Operating margins for the International segment was 14.3% in Q1, down 400 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage in China, but partially offset by strong sales leverage across other global markets and the resulting business mix.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 15% to $478 million in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Within the Global Coffee Alliance, newer platforms continue to be key drivers of growth, including Starbucks Blonde Espresso and Starbucks Creamers. Our ready-to-drink lineups are fueled by core platforms in our international markets and robust innovations in the pipeline.\nSustainability was also top of mind for the segment, trailblazing, recyclable, multiserve iced coffee bottle made from recyclable plastic. The segment's operating margin was 47.4% in Q1, up 350 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by strength in our North American coffee partnership joint venture income. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. Let me take a few minutes to go deeper on the implications to our business from the challenges we're facing in China.\nIn January, China's comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, which was an improvement from a decline of 42% in December. While we're seeing early positive signs of momentum rebuilding, headwinds related to COVID still exist in the market and are expected to impact the full Q2. As a result, we anticipate the negative impact on the operating income in Q2 to be comparable to or greater than Q1.\nAlthough we previously projected China recovery as early as Q3 of this fiscal year, we do not have clear line of sight into the timing of recovery and believe China's contribution as a percentage of our fiscal 2023 consolidated operating income to be lower than our original guidance assumed. However, our long-term opportunity in China is very strong.\nWe expect the market to see meaningful sales rebound once recovery is in full swing. Until then, we continue to stay focused on the long-term growth opportunities that China will deliver while weathering the short-term and transitory challenges. Now even with that backdrop and taking into account the uncertainty of China's recovery timing, our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged. As a few point of clarification on guidance, in China, we now expect negative comps to continue through the second quarter, followed by improvement in the balance of the year.\nAnother point of clarification is that China store growth remains unchanged as we execute our strategy to expand in new cities. Also, our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan and inflationary pressures which largely remain comparable to what we had originally anticipated. Lastly, our guidance reflects the latest projection of foreign currency translation with approximate 2 and 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings growth, respectively. This reflects an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point on both revenue and earnings growth relative to our previous expectations.\nAdditionally, in terms of quarterly shape, operating margin is expected to decline sequentially in Q2, near prior year level, driven primarily by the COVID-related headwinds in China. We still expect margins to expand in the back half of the year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4 as sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from reinvention as well as recovery in China begin to contribute to positive margin expansion as the year progresses. We continue to expect quarterly EPS shape to roughly mirror the shape of operating margin with a sequential decline in Q2 and a meaningful step up in the second half of the fiscal year.\nLastly, we also remain committed to returning approximately $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025 between share repurchases and dividends. Our repurchase program resumed in Q1 of this fiscal year and will accelerate as reinvention gains ground. Since the inception of our dividend program, 51 quarters ago, our annual dividend growth has averaged greater than 20%, and our dividend payout rates near the top percentile of growth companies of our size and our scale, which is an exceptional complement to our long-term EPS growth target as high as 15% to 20%.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, our business and our brand are strong and strengthening every day as demonstrated by the record sales in Q1. Next, our Q1 performance serves as proof point that we are progressing nicely against our strategy, inclusive of our reinvention plan and delivering the results we projected. And finally, we will continue to innovate in the critical areas of digital, product and stores as our new era of growth is just beginning to unlock, and we are excited about what lies ahead, including welcoming Laxman as CEO this spring and on our second quarterly earnings call.\nNow before I close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the hard work of our Starbucks Green Apron partners across the globe, including those in China who serve our customers in a way that only Starbucks knows how. Also, with this being Howard's last earnings call, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Howard for his vision to create a company that is truly different, where value is created for all.\nI know that I speak for many of us when I say we will honor your legacy while taking the company to the next level, all in making you, our partners and our shareholders proud. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A.\nOperator?",

Schultz\n\nFounder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Well, hello from Milan. Today has been a very special day for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life and years with Starbucks. It was 40 years ago, walking the beautiful streets of Milan, that the inspiration for the possibilities of what Starbucks could one day be and mean around the world first struck me.\nAnd here I am, back in Milan, celebrating the early days of our beautiful, thriving business in Italy, a country in which no one expected Starbucks to succeed, on the very day of our global launch of holiday, an event that has become a phenomenon all over the world.\nSo much of Starbucks' inspiration has come from Italy. And in Italy, our partner's dedication to the art of coffee, to the elegance and passion of coffee craft and to the delivery of a premium coffee experience to our customers, is being executed at the highest level. Italians have embraced Starbucks. Our top-selling beverage is actually a solo espresso, validating the quality of our coffee and the relevance of Starbucks customer experience that has defined us since Starbucks' founding in 1971.\nWe recently opened our 20th store in Verona to record crowds, with Rome and Naples fast following in 2023. Milan and Italy are reflections of the premium coffee experience Starbucks is delivering to customers in cities and countries everywhere as demonstrated by the very strong Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial and operating performance Starbucks reported this afternoon.\nIn Q4, Starbucks grew global revenues 11% over prior year to a quarterly record of $8.4 billion driven by 7% comp growth globally and 11% comp growth in North America. For the fiscal year, we grew global revenues 13% over prior year to a record $32.3 billion driven by 8% comp growth globally and 12% comp growth in North America. We also grew our global store base 6% in fiscal '22 and ended the year with roughly 36,000 stores in 83 countries.\nToday, Starbucks serves over 100 million customer occasions from our retail stores around the world and across all channels, delivers over 400 million customer coffee occasions globally every week.\nWe continue to manage the business through today's challenging operating environment, more mindful than ever of the unprecedented global economic uncertainties and challenges confronting our customers. Our strong performance in the quarter and year is particularly gratifying, in that it underscores the relevance of the Starbucks brand and the strength of our relationships with our customers around the world in the face of these unprecedented challenges.\nWe saw strong demand for Starbucks coffee in Q4 and throughout the year in every market and channel in which we operate. We are encouraged by the early signs of recovery we saw in China in Q4, where innovation, increased customer physical and digital engagement with the Starbucks brand and the relaxing of COVID restrictions, drove solid positive sales momentum and sequential quarterly improvement.\nThe speed with which our business in China accelerated in Q4 and the strong positive correlation between Starbucks revenue growth and the relaxing of COVID mobility restriction reinforces our confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China.\nHowever, as you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a significant resurgence of COVID in China. With the resurgence has come renewed lockdowns and mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy, including in many cities in which we operate, meaningfully reducing traffic in our stores. We anticipate the current COVID-related uncertainty to continue and repeat the view we shared on our Q3 call and our Investor Day, that while our long-term aspirations for China remain undiminished, we expect the recovery of our business in the country to be nonlinear. I'll spend more time on China in a few minutes.\nIn fiscal 2022, we drove meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S. alone, we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and our U.S. customers are engaging more deeply with the Starbucks brand as evidenced by a 16% increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members, up 5% over Q3. Today, Starbucks is connecting to more customers more deeply, both in the U.S. and around the world, than ever before, ideally positioning us to drive further acceleration in revenues and comps in the quarters and years ahead.\nOur performance supports our confidence in the ambitious growth agenda we announced in September, in which we will be adding roughly 8 new stores per day, delivering best-in-class returns around the world every day for the next 3 years, bringing us to nearly 45,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal 2025.\nOur Q4 results also demonstrate evidence of early but highly encouraging benefits from reinvention plan investments we detailed at Investor Day in September. And as you will hear from Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, we have clear line of sight to a full array of benefits reinvention will deliver in the quarters and years ahead.\nFollowing Frank, Sara Trilling, a 20-year Starbucks partner, who recently took over leadership of our North American business after having successfully led Asia Pacific for the last 4 years, she will provide insights into our business in North America today and what to expect in the quarters ahead. Then Rachel will highlight our financial and operating performance in Q4 and for the year and provide guidance for the year ahead. And finally, we will end the call with Q&A.\nWhen fully rolled out, Starbucks' reinvention, co-created in partnership with our partners across the country, will touch and elevate every aspect of our Starbucks partner, customer and store experiences. Last week, 2,000 Starbucks leaders from across U.S. and Canada converged in Seattle to coalesce around reinvention and take it back to their local markets. I don't think I've ever seen greater engagement in over 40 years of a more positive response to any Starbucks gathering in our history.\nReinvention investments will make it easier for our partners to do their jobs, better enable partners to satisfy growing demand in our stores and provide greater opportunity for our partners to engage with our customers. Reinvention investments are already having a measurable positive impact on our business and operations, most notably in terms of improved partner retention, increased speed of service and an elevated customer experience. And I'm particularly pleased that reinvention investments are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks Barista.\nKey to Starbucks' success and the foundation of our long-term growth strategy is Starbucks' continued global leadership around all things coffee and espresso, hot and cold, Starbucks' core. In Q4, we continued to grow from our core, innovate, introduce new levels of customization and premiumization and extend our global coffee leadership in both the hot and cold beverage categories, with an emphasis on cold coffee, a category we single-handedly created and are growing around the world.\nCustomer demand for customized, handcrafted Starbucks cold beverages is so strong that, today, cold coffee beverages account for 76% of total beverage sales in our U.S. company-operated stores. And customers are increasingly further customizing their cold coffee beverages by adding high-margin beverage flavor modifiers to create unique beverages tailored to their own particular taste preferences.\nWe also continue to introduce innovative new core hot coffee and espresso beverages and innovate around iconic platforms, like pumpkin spice, up 17% over last year driven by increased customization, including cold foams. As part of reinvention, we are rolling out a new, completely proprietary, handheld cold foamer that enhances beverage quality and increases speed of service while reducing complexity for our partners. The response from our partners has been overwhelming.\nOur growing base of new U.S. customers and Starbucks Rewards members, combined with very strong customer response to our innovative hot and cold beverage lineup to deliver the highest net sales week in our history in September. Let me just repeat that. In our history, we had the biggest sales week in September. The strength of our business as we exited September, coupled with a fantastic holiday lineup kicking off today, with our stores turning red, holiday favorites on the menu and the return of our iconic red cups, gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday in 2023.\nIn North America overall, the combination of customer shifts towards premium hot and cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions around beverage, food and modifier pricing and an 18% increase in food sales drove net revenues up 15% year-over-year to a record $6.1 billion.\nOnce again, our convenience channels, drive-through, Mobile Order & Pay and delivery drove 72% of our total sales volume. Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 55% of tender in our U.S. company-operated stores in Q4. Starbucks Rewards continues to deliver value to our customers, enable customer connection and drive our business. And despite its global scale and growth, we have significant untapped opportunities to grow our Rewards program in a very unique way.\nWe recently launched our Reward Together program, enabling a select group of leading brands to partner with us by linking their loyalty program to Starbucks Rewards. Through Reward Together, we will engage and reward members of both brands with new benefits and experiences that will make our Rewards program even more valuable, drive membership and increase customer lifetime value.\nOur first U.S. partnership with Delta Airlines launched last month to an extraordinary customer response. Both Delta and Starbucks were overwhelmed with what took place. And in September, we announced Starbucks Odyssey, our next-generation loyalty model that integrates NFTs with Rewards. Starbucks Odyssey will enable us to connect even more deeply with customers and give our customers the opportunity to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences that they cannot get in any other place.\nCustomer response to Starbucks Odyssey has been overwhelming. You will hear more about the Starbucks Odyssey in a few weeks when our first wave of customers have an opportunity to explore this new exciting way to experience and connect with Starbucks. The numbers that we will release in terms of the response will surprise many of you.\nOur fast-growing 6,600 North American-licensed store business posted very strong results in Q4, with revenues up 25% in Q4 and 29% for the year. We are proceeding with the rollout of [Starbucks Connect] across the U.S. licensed store portfolio. Starbucks Connect enables licensed stores for the first time to offer the full array of Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits. And as you will hear from Sara, the 1,600 licensed stores that have adopted Starbucks Connect are seeing a significant lift in business since adoption. Starbucks Connect enables us to capture demand across our broader portfolio and will be highly accretive to our business.\nThe momentum we saw in our International segment coming out of Q3 continued in Q4, with revenues for the quarter up 12% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. For the year, revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, also on a constant currency basis. We added 518 stores during the year and now operate nearly 18,500 stores around the world. We are sensitive to the challenges that the rapid increase in the value of our dollar is posing to our International licensees and remain in close contact as we work together to navigate the dynamic environment that we are all operating in.\nTurning to our Channels business. Starbucks is the #1 share in U.S. at-home coffee. Starbucks is the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee, and continued growth in our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined to deliver strong performance in Q4, with revenues increasing 18% on a constant currency basis to $484 million. For the year, revenues also increased 18% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis.\nNow let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China for 20 years and that our aspirations for our business in China has never been greater. We have over 6,000 stores in China today. And as Belinda shared at Investor Day, we have close to 9,000 stores -- we will have close to 9,000 stores by 2025. We will be opening our Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Park, including our largest coffee roasting and packaging plant outside the U.S. in summer 2023.\nStarbucks employs over 60,000 passionate, dedicated partners in China. Our partners are deeply engaged with their customers and demonstrated by today's record high customer connection scores. We continue to be an employer of choice and lead the way in partner investments, recently introducing a 14th month bonus for all full-time partners. And we continue to invest in China to create career and opportunity paths for our partners and to support the communities we serve.\nWe also continue to expand our customer base in China and deepen our digital connection to customers. Active Starbucks Rewards membership grew 29% sequentially in Q4 over Q3 to over 17 million members, just below historic levels, coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China.\nMobile ordering sales mix, nonexistent prior to 2019, drove 44% of mix in Q4. Delivery, up 35% year-over-year, now representing over 24% of sales. We expect mobile, digital, loyalty and delivery to continue to grow and drive our business.\nHowever, we are ultrasensitive to the evolving macro challenges that have surfaced regarding China, particularly in connection with the impact of the zero-COVID policy. But our strong belief in China is based on our success in the country and our commitment to playing the long game. We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category, but likely the #1 Western consumer brand in the country for having continued to meaningfully invest in our partners and in our business throughout the pandemic and despite the disruptions.\nLaxman's immersion is going spectacularly well. He's visited and worked in stores in the U.S. and U.K., quickly connecting and winning the hearts of Starbucks partners wherever he goes, just this week earning his Barista certification in record time and store Green Apron. Laxman's commitment to becoming intimate with store operations and our partner and customer experiences reflects our mutual understanding of what is most important in these early days of his joining Starbucks. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more and more about the company and our business. And the Board, leadership team and I are all deeply invested in his success. I cannot be more confident that Laxman is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks.\nToday, Laxman has a front-row seat as we launch our all-important holiday season. Soon, along with our leadership team, he will be leading the company, bringing reinvention to life and guiding Starbucks to the next chapters of our storied history.\nIn closing, Starbucks has never been financially stronger, better positioned or more confident in our future as we enter Q1 and holiday and embark on the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrank Foster Britt\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. It was just 50 days ago that we laid out our reinvention agenda that involve 5 major strategic shifts. First, creating a truly unified global company; second, radically improving our in-store partner experience; thirdly, reimagining our store operating model; fourth, reinvention around what customer connection means; and perhaps, most importantly, redesign the construct of what it means to be a partner at Starbucks.\nWhile still early days, we are seeing progress with several key proxy measures. For example, retention has increased with turnover scores at the hourly Barista level, lower by 1 point versus prior year and 4 points versus prior quarter. Additionally, customer connection scores show a 5-points improvement to pre-pandemic levels. All of these are early but encouraging signs.\nWe fully embrace that our partners are the most critical component to our longer-term performance, and we need to be even better at addressing their needs. Partners who proudly wear the Green Apron have bravely shared their stories and their ideas in our co-creation sessions, and we have concentrated our efforts to jointly create solutions with our partners and for our partners.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continue to improve our already industry-leading benefits to a deeper position of strength with several new programs for partners. Representative examples of improvements include: a new incentivized savings program in partnership with Fidelity, designed to help partners in case of unplanned financial challenges; a new student loan debt program to empower partners looking to find the best ways to address their college debt management obligations; an increase in sick time accrual ratios for our partners; an updated family expansion reimbursement program, aimed to assist partners with the cost of growing their families through adoption and the like.\nWe have remained committed to the critical development opportunities of our people. And as a complement to doubling our partner training hours, as Howard noted, we've reintroduced our iconic Black Apron credentialing program, and nearly 5,000 partners have already earned their apron and continue in the program.\nWe've also launched the pilot of a new partner app designed to create 1 digital community for our 270,000 U.S. and Canada company-owned operated store partners. And over time, this new digital platform will allow partners to stay connected on what matters to them most, including their schedules, their benefits and continuing to use their voice to drive the co-creation of Starbucks. More than 1,000 partners have participated in our testing and are providing feedback for our launch planned for Q2.\nObtaining the right mix and number of hours is essential to a thriving partner experience at Starbucks, and we aim to provide desired hours with flexibility and predictability. We are highly focused on honing our staffing models and operating processes to ensure we can allocate the right amount of talent to each store in every daypart and advancing our capabilities to fine-tune our hours of operations by store to reflect unique demand patterns.\nAs part of the reinvention agenda, all of these efforts share in common a primary focus to grow the lifetime value per partner and are connected to the ongoing reinvention initiatives, including in-store waste reduction and further acceleration of equipment rollout to enable an improved partner experience and higher productivity. We will also continue to focus on accelerating our trade area transformation, modernizing the way technology elevates the store experience and continuing supply chain innovation.\nLonger-term, powered by our partners' insights, we have a very robust agenda and improvement plan powered by a new architecture and vision of the partner experience. And over time, this will translate into an even more partner-centric system in the stores, affirm our reputation as a frontline talent career launchpad and improve retention rates.\nFinally, as part of this new phase of reinvention, we continue to lean into our centralized project management office to drive better integration among our initiatives and more fully capture the synergies across our store and customer innovations. Together, these initiatives are designed to strengthen our business through top line growth and margin expansion and improve the partner experience. I look forward to sharing more of the progress in the quarters ahead.\nLet me now turn it over to my partner, Sara.\n\nSara Trilling\n\nSenior VP & President of Starbucks Asia Pacific, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Sara Trilling. I'm pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role, leading the North America business.\nWhile I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year partner and most recently served as Senior Vice President of Asia Pacific. Over my Starbucks career, I've touched nearly every aspect of the business and have served many leadership positions across a variety of functions, including store development, retail operations, product and marketing. And I'm looking forward to applying the relevant breadth and depth of my experiences to this next phase of growth in North America.\nTo build on some of the comments from Frank and Howard, we continue to see very healthy growth in our North America business. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we saw the highest net sales week of all time with the launch of our fall promo. And I'm pleased to share this subsequently led to an incredibly strong September, with the 3 high sales weeks in our history.\nOur strong quarter, comparable sales of 11% and revenue growth of 15% were largely driven by a record-breaking fall launch, coupled with continued strategic pricing actions and increased food attach as well as the shift to more premium beverages and a growing demand for personalization in both company-operated as well as licensed businesses.\nElevated from pre-pandemic levels, we maintained ticket comp strength in our U.S. company-operated business at 10%, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of increased ticket comp. These results reflect the continued strength in demand for Starbucks as our customers fell into their new normal routine and behaviors. We fully expect the momentum from our record fall launch to continue as our highly anticipated holiday at Starbucks launched just today and include some great seasonal offerings.\nWhat gives us further confidence in the holiday season is the strength of the Starbucks brand with younger, more diverse customer groups. More than half our U.S. customer base is Gen Z and Millennials, reflecting relevancy and brand love across generational cohorts, trends we see with diverse customer cohorts as well.\nWe are incredibly pleased with our momentum in the business and the reinforcement of our strategy in the following key areas. First, we've established sustained relevancy of the Starbucks brand in customer loyalty. In fact, Starbucks is consistently, quarter-over-quarter, the leader in market share, first choice and past 30-day visitation when it comes to an away-from-home coffee occasion as measured by our brand equity tracker.\nWe're also pleased to share that customer connection scores have increased 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels. The strength of the brand is further illustrated by the success of our iconic pumpkin spice platform, which grew 17% year-over-year and continues to resonate with customers who love the classic Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as newer additions, such as the Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam modifier.\nSecond, our cold customized beverage strategy is working. We're seeing growth in both hot and cold and increasing customization. In Q4, more than 60% of beverage units sold in the U.S. company-operated business were customized, contributing to the $1 billion and growing annual net sales for modifiers, representing growth of 2x since the first fiscal 2019.\nFinally, we reinforced our unique position in providing experiential convenience as evidenced by all-time highs in Starbucks Rewards engagement amid Mobile Order & Pay orders. The Starbucks Rewards program in the U.S. grew 90-day active members, ending FY '22 with nearly 29 million members. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year and 55% of our U.S. company-operated revenue in the quarter, up nearly 4% from prior year, representing the highest-ever percent of tender. Mobile Order & Pay surpassed 26% in Q4 for the first time in a quarter, finishing fiscal year '22 at 25% of total transactions.\nWe're incredibly optimistic about our continued momentum in digital, following the unprecedented interest in Starbucks Odyssey, the integration of NFTs with our industry-leading loyalty program to create an accessible Web3 community that brings unique aspects of our brand to life in a new way.\nWe also experienced a wildly successful launch of Reward Together with Delta. With this partnership, our Rewards members are able to earn miles faster through their everyday purchase at Starbucks and earn even more Stars on days when they travel with Delta. The initial response from customers has been extraordinary and beyond our expectation, and this is just the start.\nImportantly, we finished the year with nearly 25% of our U.S. license portfolio live with [Starbucks Connect], allowing us to create a seamless digital experience across our stores, giving customers more ways to connect with our brands, furthering the value of the rewards experience.\nAs part of our reinvention and as we shared at our September Investor Day, we're investing in equipment to innovate for an improved partner and customer experience. We have completed the deployment of Starbucks Cold Brewer and have rolled out the Mastrena 2 espresso machine and new warming ovens to nearly 95% and 72%, respectively, of our stores across the U.S.\nThis equipment collectively supports improvement in our throughput during both peak and full day, while providing the foundation to support elevated partner and customer experiences as we further reinvention plan investments and productivity. The rollouts for these 3 items will be completed by fiscal year '23 for our company-operated stores.\nAdditionally, we rolled out nearly 60% of our handheld point-of-sale investments to nearly 75% of our cold beverage labelers. Handheld POS is already helping us capture new and latent demand in support of our ambitious revenue expectations. And we expect to see further benefit as we extend the rollout for handheld POS into fiscal year '24.\nWhile still in the early days of development, partner and customer reception of the new Siren System innovation we shared at Investor Day is overwhelmingly positive, including the Clover Vertica brewer and the new proprietary on-demand cold-pressed Cold Brew technology. We expect to begin rolling out Clover Vertica brewer later in this fiscal year, with our broader Siren System innovations fast following in fiscal year 2024.\nThrough our investments, we're giving our partners more time to focus on coffee craft and connect with customers, enabling them to continue delivering experiential convenience in a way that only Starbucks can. The powerful unlock is our reinvention positions us for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nIn fact, just this last week, we welcomed nearly 2,000 retail leaders from U.S. and Canada to Seattle for our District Manager Leadership Experience. This powerful 3-day event is designed with great intention to provide a renewed understanding of the critical role each leader plays in our business and with our people and equip them fully to lead their stores and store partners through our reinvention and into our future as we all breathe life into this reinvention plan.\nTo close, what I would leave you with -- is with this. This is an incredibly exciting time to lead our North America business. While the macro environment may have uncertainty, our performance is once again demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brand and our business. We are well positioned in this environment, which will only further strengthen as our reinvention comes to life. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Sara, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard throughout this call, starting with Howard, we had record-breaking performance this quarter, and I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved together. We finished fiscal year 2022 with consistently strong demand in the U.S. and in nearly all major markets across the globe, with that demand sustaining as we exited the year.\nOur Q4 consolidated revenue reached another historical high, $8.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year or 14% when excluding a 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% comparable store sales growth and 6% net-new store growth over the past 12 months, further strengthened by the remarkable momentum in our global licensed store businesses. In addition, this outstanding performance reflects double-digit revenue growth in all 3 of our reporting segments in constant currencies, showcasing the resiliency of our brand, power of customer loyalty and depth of our diverse portfolio.\nQ4 consolidated operating margin contracted 380 basis points from the prior year to 15.1%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training, part of which were investments under our reinvention plan. In addition, operating margin was impacted by inflationary headwinds and deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China. The overall contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nQ4 EPS was $0.81, declining 9% from the prior year, but better than expectations, including $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits primarily related to discrete tax benefits. For full year fiscal 2022, our consolidated revenue reached a record $32.3 billion, up 13% from the prior year or 15% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation driven by 8% comparable store growth, 6% net-new store growth and strength in our global licensed store businesses. Full year consolidated operating margin and EPS were 15.1% and $2.96, respectively.\nI will now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q4, up 15% from the prior year and another all-time record, primarily driven by an 11% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 10% increase in average ticket as well as net-new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Impressive momentum in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's record revenue performance.\nMy colleagues spoke in detail about our incredible U.S. performance in Q4, posting 11% comparable store sales growth. Average ticket once again broke a record, primarily driven by pricing and food attach. Despite elevated pricing actions taken throughout the year, daily store traffic in the U.S. reached approximately 95% pre-pandemic levels in September, fueled by the wildly successful fall promotion.\nImportantly, the volume of beverage and food items sold per store has well-exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and the number of unique customers, again, reached an all-time high in Q4, up 9% over the prior year and up more than 1% versus prior quarter, underscoring our brand's expanding reach and relevance and customer loyalty. North America's operating margin was 19% in Q4, contracting 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nOur disciplined actions to closely manage labor hours, reduce waste and prioritize discretionary spend also contributed to the segment's margin performance as we build a strong foundation for progressive margin expansion in years to come.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, down 1% from the prior year or up nearly 12% when excluding a 12% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This double-digit revenue growth in constant currencies was driven by sustained strength in all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 5% decline in comparable store sales as the impacts of COVID continued in China.\nAs Howard discussed, our China market continued its recovery in Q4, navigating through reoccurring COVID outbreaks and turbulent consumer mobility. The market posted a comp decline of 16% in Q4, a meaningful sequential improvement from a 44% decline in Q3. Despite this depressed traffic, the China team's outstanding leadership and strength of our brand were markedly evident in the quarter as reflected in record levels of store development, growth in delivery and the highest-ever customer connection scores.\nOutside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe sustained incredible momentum in Q4. Collectively, the market's revenue growth exceeded 30% in the quarter when excluding a 19% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. International segment's net-new stores reached a quarterly record at 518, climbing to more than 18,000 stores in total, setting the stage for a new era of growth, with a rapidly expanding footprint around the world.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 14.5% in Q4, down 750 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China, lower government subsidies as well as partner investments. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and strong sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $484 million in Q4 or up 18% when excluding a 2% impact from foreign currency translation driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Channel Development continued to play a vital role in differentiating, diversifying and amplifying our brand by creating customer occasions outside our stores. As a result, Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories.\nBuilding on the success of our newer platforms, the segment's robust innovations continued in the quarter, including the introductions of ready-to-drink Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Nitro Cold Brew in the U.S. and bottled Frappuccino Smoothie in China, to name a few. The segment's operating margin was 50.6% in Q4, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by business mix shift.\nLet's now move on to our fiscal 2023 outlook, which reflects the beginning of a new era of growth. Our guidance remains consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in September. So today, I will reaffirm and refine the guidance specific to fiscal year 2023. And we'll also introduce an outlook on a few below-the-line metrics that were not part of our Investor Day guidance.\nStarting with the first building block of our growth, comparable store sales growth. We expect fiscal 2023 U.S. comparable sales growth to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. For China, we're expecting outsized comp in fiscal year 2023 as we lap the severity of the lockdowns in the market. Given the quarterly shape of the fiscal 2022 baseline, we expect China comp to be negative in the first quarter, followed by outsized comp in the balance of the year.\nOur fiscal 2023 global comp growth is expected to be near the high end of our long-term target range of 7% to 9%, consistent with what I shared at Investor Day. And global comp in Q1, reflecting negative comp in China, is expected to be at the low end of the annual guidance range, then expanding in subsequent quarters.\nMoving on to the second building block, new store growth. We expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 3% in fiscal year 2023. In China, we will continue to rapidly expand our store footprint, with approximately 13% growth expected in fiscal year 2023. We expect our global store growth to reach approximately 7%, with over 75% of the growth coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to diversify our portfolio globally.\nWith this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with our Channel Development performance, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to reach the range of 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2023 despite an approximately 3 percentage point unfavorable impact expected from foreign currency translation.\nWithin fiscal 2023, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation is expected to reach approximately 4 percentage points in the first half of the fiscal year, tempering to approximately 1 to 2 percentage points in the back half of the year. Despite the considerable pressure we now expect from foreign currency translation, which could abate, we remain confident in our revenue guidance range for the full year. We have a solid path to capture strong demand, maximize opportunities unlocked from our reinvention plan and deliver attractive revenue results.\nOur third building block is operating margin. Globally, we expect solid margin expansion in fiscal year 2023. In terms of a quarterly shape, we expect operating margin to be tempered in Q1 and Q2, with meaningfully higher margins in Q3 and Q4 as margin benefits accumulate from the continued unlocking of the reinvention plan, coupled with the expected recovery in China.\nIn addition to the quarterly shape of operating margin, here are a few points to consider. We expect over $1 billion incremental investments in fiscal year 2023, half of which will reflect the annualization of the fiscal 2022 investments. We expect headwinds related to supply chain and commodity inflationary pressures to continue in fiscal 2023, albeit to a lesser extent relative to fiscal 2022. Headwinds will be managed through sales leverage, pricing and productivity from the reinvention, resulting in positive margin expansion as the year progresses, as I previously mentioned.\nThe fourth building block is capital allocation. We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2023 to be approximately $2.5 billion. As we shared during our Investor Day, we also expect to return approximately $20 billion to shareholders in the next 3 years between dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to targeting an approximately 50% dividend payout ratio as reflected in the recently announced dividend increase, and we'll also resume our buyback program in fiscal 2023. We expect the buyback benefit on EPS to be initially limited until fiscal 2024, when the benefit is expected to reach approximately 1%, calculated net of interest expense.\nIn regards to interest expense, we expect between $540 million and $560 million of interest expense in fiscal 2023, up from $483 million in fiscal 2022. This increase, driven by incremental debt issuances in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as outlined in our capital allocation strategy. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA.\nAs for tax rates in fiscal 2023, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is up from our fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2023.\nFinally, based on the current environment, we expect foreign currency translation to have approximate 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 earnings growth. Despite that, we continue to expect fiscal 2023 GAAP EPS growth to be at the high end of the 15% to 20% range. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to be at the low end of the long-term range of 15% to 20% as the benefits of the reinvention investments will take time to amplify.\nIt's important to note that Q4 fiscal 2022 included approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring items, largely from discrete tax benefits. And considering the quarterly EPS shape, we expect it to mirror the quarterly shape of operating margin, which will also have a meaningful step-up in the second half of the fiscal year.\nIn closing, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. We are incredibly proud of our Q4 performance, underpinned by the experience our partners create for our customers each and every day. Our 2023 guidance sets the stage for another year of record performance. Importantly, we recognize that our future growth is dependent on our investments in our partners, stores and customers. As we lean in and solve the challenges of our business, together with our partners, we are confident of our path to unlock a new era of growth, creating value for all stakeholders, partners, customers and shareholders.\nOnce again, our success is earned through our more than 450,000 Green Apron partners working across the globe to elevate the Starbucks experience each and every day. Their commitment and their unwavering focus will continue to be the cornerstone of our new era of growth.\nWith that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?",

(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVP of Head of IR, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Alex, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Starbucks' third quarter fiscal year 2022 results.

Schultz\n\nCEO, Founder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' strong Q3 results highlighted by 9% global revenue growth to a record $8.2 billion, 3% global comp growth and 9% comp growth in North America once again demonstrates the power and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand all over the world.\nI've now been back as CEO for 4 months. During that time, I've immersed myself in every segment, region, operation and aspect of our business. And given my long history with the company and our culture and my unique understanding and appreciation of the Starbucks brand, the drivers of our global business and the special relationship that exists among our people, our brand and our customers, we've been able to pinpoint the source of each of the issues and challenges confronting the company upon my return. Some are definitely COVID related. Some were a function of not focusing on the long term. And unfortunately, many were self-induced. More important, we now have clear line of sight on what we need to do to totally reinvent the company and drive accelerated profitable growth around the world.\nThe Q3 results we announced today demonstrate the early progress we have made in just 4 short months and serve as a proof point of the significant long-term global growth opportunity ahead for Starbucks. Each business segment contributed to our Q3 performance. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered our results in the face of stiff ongoing consumer economic and inflationary headwinds; COVID lockdowns across China that kept Shanghai, our largest China market, largely closed for 2 months, and that continues episodically today; and continuing shifts in customer traffic and behaviors, including materially reduced office occupancy in our largest urban markets.\nOur Q3 performance underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people, extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in groundbreaking beverage, food, digital and technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers in every market and every channel. And our performance demonstrates that the Starbucks Experience is more relevant and important than ever in today's unsettled world.\nOn today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our Q3 revenue, comp and EPS performance. I will then turn the call over to Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy Officer, to provide an overview of our reinvention plan, the strategy underpinning the investments we are making to materially elevate our partner, customer and store experiences.\nNext month, at Investor Day in Seattle, you will see for yourselves how accretive to our business our reinvention plan will be, increasing efficiency, enabling us to seamlessly handle the increasing demand in our U.S. stores and, most of all, elevating our partner, customer and in-store experiences. Our reinvention plan touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience and sets us up for accelerated long-term profitable growth and value creation benefiting all stakeholders beginning in 2023. We are executing against the reinvention plan with focus, with discipline and a deep sense of urgency.\nNext, Belinda will update you on China, where our position in the market and our aspirations for the future have never been greater. Rachel will provide a deep dive into our Q3 financial and operating results. And then we'll move on to Q&A.\nCore to Starbucks' success and long-term growth strategy is our global leadership around everything coffee. No company in the world even remotely approaches Starbucks' ability to source, blend, roast and craft the world's best coffees. And in Q3, we continued to extend our coffee leadership, innovate and bring further elements of customization and premiumization to the entire coffee category, including around cold, handcrafted and plant-based coffee beverages.\nCustomer demand for specifically customized cold coffee beverages, a category Starbucks single-handedly created and is now expanding around the world, is so strong that cold beverages now account for roughly 75% of our total beverage sales in U.S. company-operated stores. Customers are increasingly customizing their cold beverages by adding modifiers that enable the creation of a virtually unlimited range of taste, flavor and color profiles and then sharing their unique cold beverage creations with the world through social media.\nStarbucks' unique ability to deliver handcrafted, customized cold beverages that satisfy customer desires and different need states while creating opportunities for customers' self-expression deepens our connection to customers, sets us apart from any other industry participant and provides us with a significant ongoing competitive advantage in the marketplace. Iced Shaken Espresso, introduced onto our Iced Espresso platform only last year, is resonating so wildly with our Gen Z customers that it has already become the fastest-growing product category in our U.S. company-operated stores, growing 50% year-over-year, more than doubling year-to-date and importantly creating new customer occasions in the midday and afternoon dayparts. Iced Shaken Espresso was also resonating around the world. In China, for example, where Iced Shaken Espresso was only introduced in June of this year, it is already among our best-selling iced coffee beverages despite mobility restrictions in China.\nJust to summarize what's going on with cold and specifically customized beverages. The premium customized cold coffee opportunity ahead for Starbucks all around the world is simply enormous.\nLet me turn to North America. The very strong demand for Starbucks coffee in the U.S. that we reported on our Q2 call has accelerated in Q3. U.S. company-operated stores delivered record average weekly sales, 5 of the top 10 grossing sales day in our history and a $410 million sales week. In North America, overall, the combination of customer shift towards premium cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions on our part with regard to beverage and food and modifier pricing and a 19% increase in food sales, driving net revenues up 13%.\nIn addition, our North American licensed stores business, now 7,000 stores strong and growing, also posted strong results with 24% revenue growth in the quarter. While we are sensitive to the impact inflation and economic uncertainty are having on consumers, it's critically important that you all understand we are not currently seeing any measurable reduction in customer spending or any evidence of customers trading down, reflecting the strength of the Starbucks brand, deep customer engagement and loyalty, pricing power and the premium nature of our beverage and food offerings.\nWhat's driving some of the increase in traffic and the strength in our business is our Rewards program. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in Q3 totaled 27.4 million members, up 3.2 million or 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our loyal Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 53% of U.S. company-operated revenue. Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery also remained quite strong, driving 72% of our U.S. revenue. Increased Starbucks Rewards membership, customer excitement over our beverage and food offerings plus a fantastic holiday lineup that I'm certain will delight our customers gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday and 2023.\nMy first order of business upon returning to Starbucks in April was to meet with Starbucks retail store and roasting plant partners across the United States in order to better understand the state of our business and the challenges confronting our partners and the company. It soon became clear that record demand in our stores was masking significant underlying issues, including, as we shared in our last call, store designs that were ill-suited to the evolving customer behavior and traffic patterns we are seeing post COVID.\nOur stores, in many ways, are windows on America. And our partners everywhere shared similar anxieties over a wide range of issues affecting their families and their lives around safety, around mental, physical and financial health issues over the widening cultural and racial divide in the state of our country and the world. Many question whether the American Dream and economic mobility was still realistic aspirations. Our partners also shared how hard it had become to keep up with customer demand and how insufficient training had left new partners unprepared for their roles, challenging partner and customer experiences alike.\nThe conversations were raw and, in many ways, painful for our leaders to hear. But core to Starbucks culture is the requirement that we always speak with each other with honesty, transparency and without judgment or fear of appraisal. The truth is, at times, I was overwhelmed by what I heard. The challenges, the fears, the desire for emotional and financial security and the sense of belonging in our partners' lives amid an all uncertainty world.\nAt the same time, I found myself feeling so proud, so appreciative and oftentimes in awe of our partners across the country who showed up every day committed to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and communities despite the personal challenges and obstacles they were experiencing.\nWe were in a moment where Starbucks leaders needed to put themselves in the shoes of our partners and demonstrate great empathy and compassion towards them, and we needed to address our partners' concerns with urgency. What began as informal partner meeting soon evolved into focused co-creation sessions where Starbucks partners and leaders collaborated on how best to reimagine the next Starbucks. We've since held over 100 co-creation sessions. And from these sessions, our reinvention plan has taken shape.\nToday, over 30 cross-functional teams are focused exclusively on executing the U.S. reinvention plan you will see take shape over the quarters ahead. And in time, you will see best practices shared around the world. We assembled our 200 top U.S. executives in Seattle last month to kick off Starbucks reinvention and change agenda. In a few minutes, Frank Britt, a key architect of the plan, will provide you with an overview so you can begin to understand how accretive each pillar of the plan will be to our business and brand long into the future.\nThe strong revenue growth we delivered in North America in Q3 is being replicated globally. With the exception of China where the zero COVID policy continues to result in mobility restrictions and limited store operations, each one of our international regions grew revenues by double digits in Q3. It's an extraordinary accomplishment, reflecting both the strength of the Starbucks brand and strong and accelerating demand for Starbucks coffee all over the world.\nOur International performance also underscores the correctness of our strategies of investing ahead of the curve in beverage, digital and technology innovation that is relevant to our customers in driving new store growth in every market in which we operate. Overall, our International segment, excluding China, grew revenue 33% year-over-year or 50% excluding FX while meaningfully expanding operating margin, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our complementary portfolio of company-operated and licensed stores.\nLast month, several Starbucks leaders joined me on a multi-country tour across several strategic theaters of our EMEA business. In every country we visited, we were inspired by what we heard, felt and observed. Product quality, service execution and knowledge of coffee across EMEA are all delivered at the highest levels. Our EMEA teams are executing while weaving together a powerful emotional connection and sense of belonging among our partners and customers with the Starbucks Experience being the shared medium of exchange. And our EMEA partners are literally thriving, inspired and earnestly engaged in bringing our unique culture of respect, purpose, service and an authentic and aspirational love of coffee to life.\nInterestingly, while thousands of stores in many countries drove strong financial performance during the quarter, I want to showcase one market in particular that serves as a proxy for the strength of the Starbucks brand and demonstrates the enormity of the international opportunity ahead, Italy. Italy, a market we only recently entered and a market that is close to my heart and that no one ever expected us to succeed in. Starbucks is flourishing in Italy. The quality of the coffee, the food and the partner and customer experiences are second to none. Traffic in our Milano Roastery, Starbucks' shrine to coffee, is strong throughout the day, driven largely by tourist activity. But most importantly, traffic in our Italy retail stores is largely local customer driven. And when I was there, what I observed is Italians drinking straight espresso at Starbucks. We are being warmly welcomed in Italy, the country in which our Starbucks journey literally began. Given the success we are enjoying in Milan, we are now planning to open in Rome and in Florence.\nAs home to our EMEA roasting operations, Amsterdam is a strategic foothold for our international efforts. In July, we committed to a planned expansion that will materially increase our roasting capacity in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for Starbucks coffee across the region. Similar efforts are underway to support a supply chain team that currently handles logistics to over 4,000 stores across 42 countries in EMEA.\nIn Switzerland, we held highly productive sessions with our partners at Nestle. Global Coffee is among Nestle's largest strategic growth categories, and our partnership with Nestle now extends across 81 markets, focusing on at-home coffee and food service channels.\nBuilding on our #1 share position in the United States at home, retail and CPG coffee channels, we are in the very early stages of leveraging the Starbucks brand and Nestle's Global Coffee platforms and significant distribution capabilities to create new super premium coffee occasions on Nespresso platform all around the world. Our partnership with Nestle is driving meaningful competitive advantages for both companies in the marketplace and is highly accretive to our business.\nLooking ahead, we expect to see a closer Starbucks-Nestle partnership. This includes introduction of Starbucks varietals onto Nespresso's digital sales platform, a channel that does not presently exist for us and represents a massive global opportunity. Expansion of Starbucks-Nestle partnership to include inclusion of many traditional Starbucks varietals on the Nespresso digital platform, co-creation of Starbucks Reserve varietals for the virtual platform and the development of a Nespresso experience in our U.S. Roasteries. We're also looking forward to the launch of our ready-to-drink Starbucks coffees in Southeast Asia, Oceania and Latin America, which will begin rolling out in next quarter.\nIn China, mobility restrictions and limits on in-store dining continue to significantly impact the business. However, as Belinda will soon share, we are beginning to see green shoots of recovery with sales and comps coming out of the quarter, reflecting sequential improvement.\nLastly, we have been working on a very exciting new digital initiative that builds on our existing industry-leading digital platform and innovative new ways, all centered around coffee and, most importantly, loyalty that we will reveal at Investor Day. We believe this new digital Web 3-enabled initiative will allow us to build on the current Starbucks Rewards engagement model with its powerful spend-to-earn Stars approach while also introducing new methods of emotionally engaging customers, expanding our digital third place community and offering a broader set of rewards, including one-of-a-kind experiences that you can't get anywhere else, integrating our digital Starbucks Rewards ecosystem with Starbucks-branded digital collectibles as both a reward and a community building element.\nThis will create an entirely new set of digital network effects that will attract new customers and be accretive to existing customers in our core retail stores. As I mentioned at the outset, we are looking forward to fully showcasing the power and the opportunity of our reinvention plan that we will unleash at next month's Investor Day.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Frank Britt.\n\nFrank Britt\n\nThank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the good fortune of joining our company during one of its most exciting times, a time of reinvention. We have come together as a Starbucks community and architected a comprehensive plan to future-proof and profitably grow the company. Our path forward is being informed by tens of thousands of daily customer experiences and our partner stories, ideas and dreams that have all helped shape over the past several months through on-hand collaboration sessions, digital surveys, live open forums and in direct dialogue with our key leaders. This process is indicative of a new and wide-ranging approach to democratizing innovation at Starbucks.\nOur reinvention efforts will begin with our core U.S. company-owned retail business, and over time, we'll expand across our global footprint. Specifically, we have prioritized 5 major strategic shifts to pivot the U.S. business in a new direction. Today, we will provide the guideposts and address the what of the overall program, while the how of this agenda will be reviewed on Investor Day in September.\nTo that end, first, powered by ongoing partner co-creation, we work to further connect the company to truly operate as one global enterprise enabled by new ways of working and a range of contemporary practices and tools. To start, for the U.S. company-owned retail business, we will focus on better integrating our culture and values across the 3 cohorts of our retail partners, operations partners and support center partners. Our end game is a greater focus as a single company with agility and empowered organization. And we see this work as the fabric that will help bind our change management agenda and will be meaningfully catalytic to our long-term operating and financial performance.\nSecondly, we are fully embracing the need to radically improve our in-store partner experience. We know that our partners are vital to bringing an elevated Starbucks brand to our customers every day, and we seek to honor, empower and affirm their strategic importance. The first principles of our new partner engagement approach include both greater safety and kindness in our stores, personalized career pathway that drives advancement and opportunity and an explicit and personal emphasis on improving overall partner well-being.\nTo that end, as we shared in our last earnings call, we have several high-impact improvement efforts in flight, including this week's wage acceleration for all U.S. in-store partners, doubling in-store partner training investments, reintroduction of our iconic Black Apron and Coffee Masters credential and the implementation of a new digital partner engagement platform. We also expect to roll out both the universal tipping and a new recognition and badging platform by calendar year-end 2022. Each of these substantial actions are part of a multiphase path to reinventing the retail partner experience that we expect will have a direct positive effect on partner retention, customer connection and essential brand affinity metrics.\nThird, we must reimagine our stores. This starts with the core engine of production that must be better calibrated for the customer habits of today and deliver superior experiences through personalization across every format and in every channel. Innovations such as new bar configurations, patented coffee technology, novel store prototypes are high priorities in the plan designed to improve throughput and heavily customized beverages, along with both customer and partner experience. Our high-priority improvement efforts include key equipment acceleration to drive more efficient and effective operations such as Clover Vertica and expansive renovation and new store agenda.\nFourth, we will further evolve how we reconnect with customers, mindful that each individual consumer must be provided a uniquely personal experience that is unified across channels. Building on our strong track record of superior customer engagement, representative initiatives in this sphere included a reimagined approach for customer-facing products and platforms, new models of effortless digital ordering and further growing the value proposition of our loyalty programs through novel and new strategic partnerships.\nFifth, we will redesign what partnership means at Starbucks, creating new ways to continue to evolve us from a listening company to a co-creation company. This translates into new approaches to shared innovation, shared accountability and shared success. This is both a competitive and a generational necessity. And for us, it's actually quite natural. Starbucks is built through the power of our partners' ideas and voices, and we know that reinvention must first unleash and then harness the power within every one of our partners.\nFinally, it's important to be declarative that within our highly integrative change agenda, coffee innovation is far more than an initiative or a project. Instead, the role of coffee will be threaded throughout each of our priorities and serve as our inspiration, foundation and fiercest differentiator in defining the future of Starbucks.\nIn summary, we firmly believe that when you combine the 5 strategic reinvention areas, bolstered by a rich tapestry of aligned initiatives and the reaffirmation of the importance of coffee, you will begin to see the emergence of a Starbucks that once again drives outsized performance financially, outsized impact socially and creates a work environment where all of our partners feel greater personal agency and are providing a personalized career path that matches their unique needs and aspirations. In the end, our goal is to become a wholly new kind of company that again sets a new higher standard for our industry and our business overall. We look forward to sharing more details on our Investor Day in September.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Belinda.\n\nChing Ying Wong\n\nChairman & CEO of Starbucks China, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Frank. In Q3, China faced its most severe COVID disruption since the onset of the pandemic. Mobility restrictions and lockdowns were implemented faster and eased more slowly under China's zero COVID policy. Shanghai, our largest market with more than 940 stores, was completely locked down for approximately 2/3 of the quarter. In Beijing, 150 stores or roughly 1/3 of our stores in the market were closed for almost 6 weeks with the balance of our Beijing stores operating without indoor dining.\nWe entered Q3 with over 1,300 stores, close to 1/4 of our total portfolio, temporarily closed. We exited the quarter with roughly 2,000 stores across nearly 50 cities operating with mandated reductions in seating capacity or other COVID restrictions. Similar patterns remain today with COVID restrictions being eased in some cities and new restrictions imposed in others. We continue to expect our recovery in China to be nonlinear.\nIn Q3, we continued to deepen our partnerships with suppliers, landlords and local authorities, streamline and adapt our supply chain, add new chapters to our COVID playbook and position the business for accelerated profitable growth as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. Together, these efforts have provided us the flexibility and muscle we need to continue to operate as efficiently as possible given current market challenges. As a result, we were able to move quickly to reopen 90% of our Shanghai stores just within a few days of the city reopening.\nWe continue to put our partners first, ensuring their safety and well-being and compensating them fully even when our stores were closed. In turn, our partners continue to deliver exceptional experiences for our customers, as reflected in the record high customer connection scores we achieved in Q3.\nCOVID is forcing Starbucks to become more flexible, resilient and agile in China and get even better at operating and executing at scale. The benefit of our investments in our people and our operations will become increasingly evident in post-COVID quarters and years ahead.\nCOVID-related headwinds in Q3 resulted in Starbucks net revenue in China declining 40% and sales comp declining 44% versus last year. But I'm pleased to report that we saw immediate improvement in traffic and sales following Shanghai's reopening in early June, saw steady sequential improvement in both metrics through the month and exited the quarter with a negative comp of 24% after indoor dining restrictions in Shanghai were partially lifted at the end of June. The improvement was fueled by customers returning to our stores and celebrating the reconnection and familiarity with the Starbucks brand. We're seeing a strong positive correlation between comp improvement and the easing of COVID restrictions, giving us confidence that we'll see both a strong rebound in sales and improved flow-through once mobility restrictions in China are fully lifted.\nWe continued our store expansion in Q3, opening 107 net new stores and entering 3 new cities despite the headwinds and now operate 5,761 stores across 228 cities. And we remain on track to have 6,000 stores in China by the end of this year. Our new stores continue to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability.\nThe investments we're making to elevate our customers' digital experience and strengthen their digital connection to Starbucks are paying off. Mobile ordering sales mix increased to a record high 47% in Q3, up 13% over prior year and up 4% over Q2 as we adapted to COVID-driven changes in customer behavior. We also continue to invest in product innovation and extending Starbucks coffee leadership and authority in China. As Howard mentioned, Iced Shaken Espresso introduced only in June has already become one of our best-selling iced coffee beverages among our Gen Z customers, driving both sales and incremental traffic.\nOur Q3 performance demonstrates the resilience of the Starbucks brand and business in China and that we're continuing our relentless focus on the long term even as we navigate short-term disruptions, positioning us to resume accelerated and long-term sustainable growth in China as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. I want to sincerely thank all of our partners in China for their dedication, commitment and deep loyalty and for taking care of our communities, our customers and each other during this unprecedented time.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Belinda, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned at the top of the call, we delivered record-breaking revenue performance during the quarter, driven by continued strong customer demand globally despite a greater-than-expected impact from mobility restrictions in China. We also exceeded our earnings expectations, demonstrating our ability to effectively deliver results while executing on planned investments and navigating a dynamic environment.\nIn Q3, we delivered record quarterly global revenue of $8.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year or 11% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation. Our strong growth was driven by double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. as well as nearly all major markets and channels across our global portfolio, partially offset by a 40% decline in China revenue.\nQ3 consolidated operating margin contracted 350 basis points from the prior year to 16.9%, primarily driven by ongoing inflationary headwinds, significant investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and deleverage related to COVID lockdowns in China. These were partially offset by pricing in North America and leverage outside of China. Q3 EPS was $0.84, declining 15% from the prior year but ahead of expectations.\nI will now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q3, up 13% from the prior year and also an all-time record, primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, including an 8% increase in average ticket as well as net new store growth over the past 12 months. Compelling growth in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's strong revenue performance.\nOur U.S. business posted 9% comparable store sales growth, driven by ticket, a remarkable feat considering we were lapping a record-breaking quarter from last year. Our average ticket reached an all-time high yet again with the year-over-year increase driven by strategic pricing actions and food attach.\nStrong food attach is a direct result of continued innovation, which resonates with our customers. New items, including our Lime-Frosted Coconut Bar and staples such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, both performed well. Our creative innovation approach has led to successful beverage and food pairings, fueling food attach and driving daypart growth. While transactions remained below pre-pandemic levels, average weekly sales and unique customer counts reached record levels in the quarter, demonstrating that the Starbucks brand is reaching more customers than ever, and customers are highly engaged when they frequent our stores.\nAs both Howard and Frank discussed, we are singularly focused on executing the reinvention plan. Although measurable benefits of the reinvention plan investments will begin to manifest in FY '23, we are encouraged by the investments made so far this year, as we've already experienced increased labor availability and stability, more predictable operating hours as well as higher partner engagement scores in the U.S.\nOur tenured partner turnover, those with 1 to 2 years of tenure, has also improved, evidence that our targeted investments to address wage compression are making a difference. We know based on data across our more than 9,000 U.S. company-operated stores that stores with lower turnover and higher partner engagement tend to have better operational and financial metrics relative to their peer set, often leading to better overall customer connection stores. We believe our intentional and targeted investments, which are part of the reinvention plan, will meaningfully elevate the Starbucks Experience for partners, stores and customers.\nNorth America's operating margin was 22.2% in Q3, contracting 250 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to ongoing inflationary headwinds, labor investments, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training support costs, partially offset by pricing. While we begin executing investments under the reinvention plan, we were also focused on taking disciplined actions to offset margin pressures. Such measures include targeted pricing actions, store throughput initiatives and prioritization of discretionary spend, enabling the segment to fund critical investments while delivering Q3 performance as planned.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, down 6% from the prior year or up 3% when excluding a 9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. We saw strong sales growth across every major market in the segment outside of China and increased our net new store count by 8% over the last 12 months. The growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in comparable store sales, reflecting the severe impacts of COVID lockdowns across China, as Belinda noted.\nOutside of China, the tremendous growth of our international markets across our global portfolio continued into Q3, growing at 50% and more than offsetting the revenue challenges we experienced in China when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Virtually all of our key markets and regions posted double-digit revenue growth, including our licensed markets. Most of these markets' revenues have reached or exceeded pre-COVID levels and have set new record highs in recent quarters, driven by strong innovation and expanded digital capabilities. Strong momentum, combined with the sizable opportunity afforded by new store formats, gives us great confidence in the long runway of growth ahead for our international markets.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 12.4% in Q3, down 950 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the leverage related to COVID impacts in China, sustained inflationary headwinds, lapping higher prior year government subsidies as well as partner investments, partially offset by strong sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nLooking ahead, however, the International segment may face near-term challenges. Given the prolonged lockdowns in China with limited mobility recovery in Q3, the headwinds now extend into Q4 as the market continues to recover. The current pace of recovery implies that China's operating income contribution as a percent of global operating income may be reduced further than what we had previously anticipated to roughly 1/4 of the contribution realized in a typical fiscal year. Outside of China, the increase in COVID cases around the world may temper the rapid growth we are currently seeing in many markets.\nMoving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $480 million in Q3, driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink businesses. Channel development continues to play an essential role in amplifying and diversifying the Starbucks presence around the world and creating new occasions. Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. As Howard mentioned, our partnership with Nestle continues to strengthen, and we're pleased with the competitive advantage it has created and excited about the heightened performance the strategic partnership will unleash.\nNewer platforms continue to be significant drivers of growth for the Global Coffee Alliance, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Within our ready-to-drink lineups, we continue to be pleased with our recent product innovations like our new chilled cup offerings in our international markets with robust innovations in the pipeline fueling continued long-term growth. The segment's operating margin was 40% in Q3, down 670 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by a decline in joint venture income related to our U.S. ready-to-drink business, primarily due to inflation as well as business mix shift.\nNow moving on to the balance of fiscal year '22. While our guidance remains suspended for the balance of this fiscal year, we wanted to provide some insights regarding Q4. We now expect our Q4 margin and EPS to be lower than Q3 with greater year-over-year pressures primarily due to 3 reasons. First, the start of mobility recovery in China was later than expected, impacting the pace of recovery previously assumed in Q4. Second, our Q3 performance benefited from approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits, including release of a custom duties accrual, tax credits, government subsidies and other items which we do not expect to continue in Q4. And third, as previously announced, Q4 will be impacted by a sequential step-up in our investments as well as our typical seasonality.\nBetween executing on the reinvention plan and other investments such as increases in wage benefits announced earlier this year, we expect our U.S. investments to more than double from Q3 to Q4. Although these factors will impact our Q4 results, they're expected to be transitory in nature, and our commitment to accelerating long-term growth remains intact.\nFrom a shareholder return perspective, although we announced the suspension of share repurchases for the balance of fiscal year '22, we have nearly returned $6 billion between share repurchases and dividends during the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. Additionally, we remain committed to sustaining an attractive dividend and continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, which is near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale. Our commitment reflects our confidence in the strength of the business and to returning compelling cash distributions to shareholders while retaining balance sheet flexibility and funding our investments.\nIn closing, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. Our Q3 performance underscored continued strength in customer demand for Starbucks coffee across the globe balanced with our ability to execute investments despite macroeconomic and operational headwinds. Our commitment to deliver shareholder value has not wavered, and we are making the right decisions and investments today for the future of Starbucks, balancing the value we create for all stakeholders. Our acceleration of long-term growth is rooted in our ability to execute against our reinvention plan, and we're looking forward to sharing details and providing a comprehensive update on our business outlook for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September.\nAs always, the real credit for our success belongs to all of our Green Apron partners around the world who strive to deliver the best Starbucks Experience possible each and every day. They have our greatest respect and appreciation as we reinvent the next phase of Starbucks together.\nWith that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?",

My name is Alex, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVP of Head of IR, Starbucks Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Starbucks' second quarter fiscal year 2022 results. Today's discussion will be led by Howard Schultz, Interim Chief Executive Officer; Belinda Wong, Chairwoman of Starbucks China; Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

For non-GAAP financial measures mentioned in today's call, please refer to the earnings release and our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures.\nThis conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website through Friday, June 3, 2022. For calendar planning purposes, please note that our third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, 2022.\nAnd with that, allow me to turn the call over to Howard.\n\nHoward D. Schultz\n\nCEO, Founder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Love and responsibility brought me back to Starbucks. My love of the company and my deep responsibility for our partners and shareholders. In the month I've been back, I've traveled the country and met with thousands of Starbucks retail store partners and visited all 5 of our roasting plants, and I've learned firsthand about the unique challenges confronting the company today.\nI've also experienced the passionate relationship our partners have with the company and the enduring emotional connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand. COVID presented unprecedented operating challenges to consumer brands. COVID also drove dramatic changes in customer behavior that Starbucks stores and systems were not designed or built for. The challenges have been amplified by record demand for Starbucks coffee in our U.S. stores that has accelerated with the lifting of COVID restrictions.\nOur Q2 results tell the story. In Q2, our sales comp in North America grew 12% over last year, 23% compared to Q2 2020. Both drive-thru and Mobile Order & Pay activity have surged, together now generating over 70% of our U.S. store volume. Delivery, a nearly $500 million business, was up 30% in the first half of fiscal year. And in our stores, customers are increasingly further customizing already complex handcrafted cold beverages.\nThe combination of shifts and customer patterns, accelerating demand and algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed tremendous strain on our U.S. store partners. Ordinarily, we would have anticipated and invested ahead of the shifts we're seeing, but COVID disruptions interfered with our ability to make the required investments in store design, operations, infrastructure and technology to do so.\nAs a result, we've been unable to meet the relentless demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores as seamlessly as our customers and partners expect and candidly deserve. Simply said, we do not, today, have the adequate capacity to meet the growing demand for Starbucks coffees.\nGoing forward, we will be making investments in our partners and business to literally catch up on investments we have not made and make further investments to position the company ahead of the coming growth curve. We will also be accelerating our new store growth with 90% of new stores being high-returning drive-throughs. Our newest class of drive-throughs will integrate new store designs, technology, including more handheld devices and equipment improvements that will increase efficiency, speed of service, and, we believe, deliver even greater profitability in the future. We will then incorporate the new technologies and equipment into our existing stores and provide our people with the tools and resources they need to elevate the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers and create even more demand in the future.\nAnd we'll be making significant investments to extend our digital capabilities and deepen our digital connection to customers and the emotional attachment our customers have to the Starbucks brand. Returns on our digital investments are consistently among the highest returns we generate, which brings us to the decision we will revisit in fiscal '23 to suspend stock buybacks. Buying back stock yields us, on average, about a 10% return. With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets, a 10% return is not satisfactory to me. Throughout our history, the investments we have made in our people and business have always delivered outsized returns to our shareholders.\nWe're so eager to show off our pipeline of disruptive innovation that we're moving our Investor Day up to September in Seattle from December in New York. With significant innovation around technology and personalization we will reveal our industry game-changers that will further increase store productivity and efficiency. What you will see is the coming transformation and reimagination of the Starbucks customer and partner experiences.\nThe transformation will accelerate already record demand in our stores, but the investments will enable us to handle the increased demand and deliver increased profitability, while also delivering an elevated experience to our customers and most importantly, reducing strain on our partners. We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience.\nWe've identified over $200 million of investment that's incremental to the significant investments we've already committed to in our U.S. company-operated stores this year. These include further investments in training, wage and equipment and new investments in internal communication with our people, where we will launch a new partner app to communicate directly with all store partners.\nWe will also be reaffirming our commitment to coffee excellence and partner education by reintroducing our Black Apron, Coffee Master and Origin Trip programs. And in 2023, we will introduce enhanced digital tipping for our partners. We believe these investments will improve retention and recruiting and elevate the experience we deliver to our partners and our customers.\nOver the last month, we've realigned Starbucks U.S. organization to focus entirely on transforming and reimagining our core U.S. business. Belinda Wong will share plans for accelerated growth in China as soon as COVID-related mobility restrictions there are lifted. And make no mistake, our aspirations around China have never been greater and I remain convinced Starbucks' business in China will be eventually larger than our business in the U.S.\nWe have a big breakthrough idea around the launch of Starbucks Web 3.0 and a unique platform for NFTs that Brady Brewer and Adam Brotman, architect of Mobile Order & Pay and the Starbucks digital app, who is serving as a special adviser to us, will shortly tell you about. I believe Web 3.0 will create an authentic digital third place experience and drive substantial new revenue streams for Starbucks and be accretive to the brand.\nOur Web 3.0 strategy is a proxy for the greater ambition we have for the company going forward. Despite the fact that post COVID, our customers are not using our stores the same way, and we've been operationally challenged as a result, our national retail footprint and best-in-class real estate portfolio is still enabling us to meet customers wherever they are and irrespective of their needs state. This relentless demand we're seeing in our stores today underscores this reality.\nLooking ahead, try to imagine thousands of vastly more productive and efficient Starbucks stores reconfigured to align with today's customer behavior and built around technology that will deliver increased speed of service, improved labor management and reduced unit cost, an elevated partner and customer experience. Now imagine the accretive impact to our financials when we reengineer our stores to deliver what we're capable of in delivering and arming our people with the tools and resources they need to once again exceed our customers' expectations.\nFrom my perspective, I understand what's needed, and I'm back to lead this transformation and committed to seeing it through. Starbucks sits alone with something few, if any, of our peers literally have, and that is unmet demand. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing, promotions and social media trying to create demand. We have demand everywhere we look, despite having not lived up to the expectations we set for ourselves, let alone exceeding the expectations of our customers and our people since the pandemic.\nThe big opportunity ahead for us is to meet strong and growing demand in our stores more efficiently and effectively and to leverage technology to enhance productivity and reduce burden on our store partners.\nLet me highlight just a few sources of the accelerating demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores and business. Mobile Order & Pay, an over $4 billion business, is up 400% in 5 years, is up 20% over last year. Our $500 million delivery business is up 30% over last year. The Starbucks Card puts our brand in the hands of nearly 120 million people and is alone larger than the entire gift card category. Starbucks customers are increasingly prepaying for their purchases in huge volumes, roughly $11 billion last year, and we are on track to exceed that figure this year.\nAt this moment, well over $1 billion is loaded on Starbucks Cards waiting to be spent in our stores. And active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. grew 17% over last year to Q2 to 27 million members. Strong underlying demand means the productivity and efficiency investments I've described represent literally low-hanging fruit available to us right now.\nIn every sense, Starbucks remains a growth company today and will remain a growth company into the future. Two related dynamics underscore the power of the equity of the Starbucks brand and support our growth aspirations: consistent pricing power and strong demand for Starbucks products in CPG channels. Over the last year, we raised prices several times to address increasing inflationary pressures. Yet, we experienced negligible customer attrition, once again demonstrating the elasticity of demand for Starbucks coffee.\nEven so, inflationary pressures have outpaced our price increases, resulting in several points of margin compression in the short term and costing us over 200 basis points in the first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, we were able to absorb the incremental cost while still delivering on our EPS expectations.\nIn our channels business, Starbucks today has the #1 share in the U.S. at coffee and the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee. Customer loyalty inside and outside our stores has never been greater. You have to ask yourself how many retail companies have a consumer brand that is best of class and literally the #1 position in grocery and in multiple channels of distribution. You'd be hard-pressed to find any. I could not be more optimistic or confident in the successful transformation and reimagination of our store partner and customer experiences.\nLet me turn to China. I cannot think of any other Western consumer brand, let alone a food and beverage retailer, that has performed as well as us in China over the last 20 years. I say that with great pride having been to China so often, building confidence, trust and respectful relationships with government officials and working closely with our Chinese team.\nHowever, the situation in China is unprecedented. Shanghai, a city 4x the size of New York City, is completely locked down. Other major cities, including Beijing, are experiencing new COVID outbreaks and implementing new mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy.\nConditions in China are such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year. Given the materiality and the high level of ongoing uncertainty around China, accelerating inflation and the significant investments we are planning, the only responsible course of action for us to take is to suspend guidance for Q3 and Q4.\nAs we move through Q3 and approach September's Investor Day, we will have much greater visibility on Q4, holiday and fiscal '23, and be in a position to share details around our comprehensive post-COVID China plan with you.\nI'm very pleased with the growth we're seeing from our international business. Excluding China, our International segment grew comps in the double digits in the quarter, stronger than anticipated, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio and the opportunity ahead. Even including the impact of China, our International segment still grew 4% in the quarter over last year to a record $1.7 billion.\nOur international store base grew 9% over last year to over 17,700 stores. [15%] of that growth was in licensed markets. We expect 75% of the net new stores we will open in fiscal '22 to be outside the U.S., further underscoring the enormous global and the opportunity ahead.\nNow let me turn to a subject in the news. Across America, there is a movement in the media and across multiple industries, including the service sector, whereby fellow citizens have begun turning to labor unions as a means of gaining voice, representation and improved working conditions. This movement is not related to any specific company.\nWe are highly emphatic to the root causes of the frustration and anxieties that Gen Z Americans are facing, having come of age during turbulent moments in our history: the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, The Great Recession and now The Global Coronavirus Pandemic. These young people have completely valid concerns given today's uncertainty and economic instability. They look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling.\nI understand the climate, and I'm deeply sensitive to the needs of all of our Green Apron partners. Yet, we have a very different and vastly more positive vision for our company based on listening, connecting and collaborating directly with our people.\nThroughout our history at Starbucks, we have led our industry, and in many cases, corporate America, in introducing breakthrough benefits for our people. Aon Hewitt, the gold standard in benefits, rates Starbucks in the 100th percentile in the retail sector, the 100th percentile, including from part-time workers who want stability and flexibility to achieve their future aspirations. That means no retail company in America ranks above Starbucks for the benefits we provide our people. We are proud of our history and leadership in wages and benefits, and we are committed to doing even more to meet the evolving needs of our Starbucks partners in the future.\nSharing success through wins and benefits with our partners is among our core values, and has been for 50 years, and our values are not and never have been the result of demands or interference from any outside entity. It's who we are, it's who we have been and who we always will be. Compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what Starbucks offers. We remain committed to doing the right thing for each and every Starbucks partner and that includes respect for differing opinions, inclusion and embracing diversity and individuality.\nToday, we take further steps to modernize our pay and benefits vision for our partners with further investments in wage, barista skills training, coffee excellence and financial wellness and literacy. And in September, we will share additional initiatives we are planning for Starbucks partners in areas that include help with student loan refinancing, additional skills recognition programs enhanced in-app tipping and new profit-haring initiatives.\nPartners at Starbucks U.S. company-operated stores, where we have the right to unilaterally make these changes, will receive these wages and benefit enhancements. This covers more than 240,000 Starbucks partners and roughly 8,800 Starbucks stores across the country.\nWe do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway. Partners in those stores will receive the wages increases that were announced in October 21, but Federal law prohibits us from promising new wages and benefits at stores involved in union organizing. And by law, we cannot implement unilateral changes at stores that have a union. Where Starbucks is required to engage in collective bargaining, we will negotiate in good faith. Starbucks will not favor or discriminate against any partner based on union issues. And we will respect the right of Starbucks partners to make their own decisions when exercising these rights.\nA question I get asked frequently is how long are you going to stay? So let me try and preempt it here. I've just framed the enthusiasm and the optimism I have for our transformation plan going forward. We have line of sight on what the transformation looks like and how meaningfully our plan will benefit the company and our people as together we co-create and reimagine the future chapters of Starbucks' storied history. The plan I shared is being designed mindfully and strategically and will be executed successfully. This I can assure you.\nThe Board and I have agreed I will stay to help transition our next leader. We are driving towards naming the new leader in the fall. After joining the company, he or she will undergo full immersion and have the opportunity to collaborate with me for a defined but not indefinite period. The plan is for me to completely hand over the CEO reins sometime in the first calendar quarter of '23 and to thereafter remain on the Starbucks Board.\nOver the last 50 years, we have built Starbucks into one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. And we have delivered best-in-class returns to our shareholders since being a public company in 1992. The investments in our people and our company we discuss today will absolutely assure that despite our success in the past, our best days are ahead.\nWe're looking forward to demonstrating what's ahead and the enthusiasm we have to sharing that with you on our Investor Day in September.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Belinda. Belinda?\n\nChing Ying Wong\n\nChairman & CEO of Starbucks China, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. While we are into the third year of navigating through COVID in China, in Q2, we encountered the most severe resurgence of the virus to date. 72% of the 225 cities we're in experienced Omicron outbreaks, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. With this more infectious variant, mobility restrictions and lockdowns are imposed faster and relaxed more cautiously.\nStarbucks' focus since the start of the pandemic has been to protect the health and well-being of our partners and customers, provide support and show up positively in our communities. Our efforts have deepened our connection to customers and made our partners proud.\nOver the last 2 years, we have built up muscle and agility to navigate through COVID challenges. With every resurgence, we add new chapters to our China COVID playbook, strengthening our capabilities and resilience. As we moved into Q3 and continuing today, roughly 1/3 of our stores remain temporarily closed or are offering delivery or MOP only. And most of our remaining stores are operating under strict safety protocols that interfere with our traffic and operations.\nAs a result, net revenue in China declined 14% and sales comp declined 20% in Q2 versus last year, after adjusting for the VAT subsidy, all from reduced traffic. We expect an even greater impact on our Q3 results due to the timing of the Shanghai lockdown and a further resurgence of the virus in other cities, including Beijing. We expect mobility restrictions to continue under the country's zero-COVID policy for the foreseeable future.\nIn Q2, we continue to invest to increase our digital connection to customers. As a result, digital mix now represents a record 43% of sales. Our launch of Starbucks Delivers on Meituan in January has driven incrementality and make Starbucks the coffee category leader on third-party delivery platforms.\nWe remain laser-focused on our growth as we manage through short-term challenges. At our China Investor Day in 2018, we shared our aspiration to operate 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Despite years of COVID disruptions, we remain on track to do so, adding 97 net new stores in Q2, with our new stores continuing to deliver best-in-class returns and profitability.\nWe also continue to invest in smart technologies to improve our productivity and efficiency, leverage our scale and deliver an elevated experience to our partners and customers. We're extremely proud that despite COVID challenges, we achieved our highest-ever customer connection score in March.\nThe enduring loyalty and connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand sets us apart from all competitors. Today, 1 in 2 coffee consumers in China choose Starbucks over any other coffee retail brand, a huge lead that we have held for years and continue to build upon.\nOur dreams and aspirations for Starbucks China have never been greater, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in China while managing through the pandemic. Our accomplishments are due to the extraordinary dedication and efforts of our 70,000 partners. No coffee retailer in China is better positioned than Starbucks to navigate the current headwinds on or to resume accelerated growth once COVID mobility restrictions are lifted.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brady. Brady?\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Belinda. Starbucks is one of the most sought-after brands in the world. And by engaging deeply with our customers over 50 years, we've amassed a treasure trove of assets, both physical and digital. Just one example being the nearly 27 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. We're activating these unique brand assets as a catalyst to accelerate the future of Starbucks as a global brand and as a business.\nFrom our beginning, we've nurtured human connection and served a fundamental belief that coffee brings us together. We brought this to life in what we've called the third place, a place between home and work, where you could connect and feel a sense of belonging over coffee.\nNow we are extending the third place concept of Starbucks into a new kind of community. Emerging technologies associated with Web 3, and specifically NFTs, now enable this aspiration and allow us to extend who Starbucks has always been at our core.\nWe are creating the digital third place. To achieve this, we will broaden our framework of what it means for people to be a member of the Starbucks community, adding new concepts such as ownership and community-based membership models that we see developing in the Web 3 space.\nWe will lead by aligning our initiatives with our sustainability commitments, making deliberate choices to build the community on environmentally sustainable Web 3 platforms. Imagine acquiring a new digital collectible from Starbucks, where that product also serves as your access pass to a global Starbucks community, one with engaging content experiences and collaboration all centered around coffee.\nThis community will further strengthen the Starbucks brand, engage our partners and we expect it to be accretive to our business. Starbucks has the history of taking leading-edge technology and innovation and making it accessible and approachable to the mainstream. You've seen it with our digital experiences, whether it was introducing ability to pay with your phone, mobile order or even access WiFi long ago. Starbucks can serve as a bridge to the future for our nearly 100 million customer occasions per week around the world.\nWe'll take our first step toward a digital third place and our broad vision for Web 3 with an anticipated launch in this year. This is just the beginning of an exciting future.\nNow I'll turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrated strong customer demand across our portfolio despite continuing COVID headwinds. We delivered global revenue of $7.6 billion in Q2, up 15% from the prior year, a second quarter record.\nOur results were primarily driven by 18% revenue growth in the U.S. and stellar performance across our diverse global portfolio. We are particularly pleased with the strong results in light of the dynamic environment.\nQ2 consolidated operating margin contracted 300 basis points from the prior year to 13%, primarily due to inflation, which increased over the course of the quarter, significant investments in store partner wages and benefits and reduced traffic in China. The margin contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America. Q2 EPS was $0.59, declining 3% from the prior year, consistent with our expectations.\nI will now provide some segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q2, up 17% from the prior year and also a Q2 record, primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transactions. Strong performance of new stores over the past 12 months and the accelerated recovery of our licensed stores also contributed to this compelling level of revenue growth.\nU.S. comparable store sales were 12% despite significant store hour modifications in the early part of the quarter. The sustained momentum across our cold platform and food attached, coupled with the return of winter favorites and newer offerings such as the Pistachio Latte all contributed to these strong results.\nOur average ticket continued to grow, reaching an all-time high, driven by strategic beverage pricing and another record-breaking quarter of food attach with food sales increasing 25% from the prior year. We continue to engage with customers where and how they prefer, as our drive-through windows, mobile order and delivery channels collectively accounted for 75% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q2. These convenient order channels and compelling product offerings cannot be easily replicated at home.\nOur customers continue to make Starbucks a part of their daily routine, fueling growth across all dayparts and drive-throughs and cafes with specific strength in suburban and rural areas. Underpinning the enduring demand is our continued focus on digital customer engagement with Starbucks Rewards members delivering 54% of the revenue in our U.S. company-operated stores, the highest level of engagement on record, up 2 percentage points from the prior year.\nNorth America's operating margin was 17.2% in Q2, contracting 260 basis points from the prior year due to inflation, investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as the lapping of prior year government subsidies. These margin headwinds were partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nThroughout the quarter, we executed our plan to offset near-term margin pressures by accelerating price increases, reducing spend in discretionary cost areas and activating throughput initiatives across our operations. These actions helped the company deliver Q2 profitability as planned despite higher-than-expected COVID isolation pay and ongoing inflationary headwinds, which increased considerably over the course of the quarter.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered its highest second quarter revenue ever, reaching $1.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year despite the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korean market to a fully licensed business.\nGrowth was partially offset by an 8% decline in comparable store sales, including a 3% decline attributable to the lapping prior year VAT benefit as well as a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the VAT impact, international comparable store sales declined 5%. And excluding China, international comparable store sales increased meaningfully.\nShifting to China. As you're aware, and as Belinda discussed, China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. Although China's comparable store sales improved sequentially in January, traffic lessened considerably in February and March as Omicron cases surged and lockdowns were implemented, leading to a comparable store sales decline of nearly 50% in the last week of March as we exited the quarter. As a result, second quarter comparable store sales declined 23% in the market or 20% excluding an impact of lapping the prior year VAT relief.\nAt the end of Q2, roughly 1/3 of our stores in China remains temporarily closed or offered mobile ordering channels only. A sizable number of these stores were high-volume stores located in Tier 1 cities, including Shanghai, with the balance of active stores operating under elevated COVID safety protocols. Despite the considerable near-term headwinds, we remain focused on executing against our growth strategy in China.\nAs Belinda shared, given our portfolio's healthy fundamentals, expanding digital footprint and record customer connection, coupled with vast opportunity ahead, we remain very optimistic for our future growth in China.\nOutside of China, the recovery of our international markets gained momentum across our global portfolio in Q2, with many of our licensed markets achieving record revenue levels in the quarter with revenue growth for the segment outside of China reaching 23%, once again demonstrating the underlying health of our business as mobility restrictions subside.\nOperating margins for the International segment was 13.1% in Q2, down 600 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by strategic and partner investments lapping higher prior year COVID relief, including government subsidies as well as higher product and distribution costs from sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage across the P&L.\nStrong performance of our international markets outside of China helped offset the significant sales deleverage in China. As the adverse impact from China lockdowns intensified in the last few weeks of Q2 and amplified further as we entered Q3, we expect China's results to continue to be a headwind throughout the current quarter.\nMoving on to Channel Development. The segment's revenue grew 25% to $463 million in Q2, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. The segment continued to amplify the Starbucks brand, led by the growth of our U.S. at-home coffee under the Global Coffee Alliance, which continued to see strong performance driven by Starbucks by Nespresso platform, fueled by the Vertuo line.\nWe had exciting innovation launches in our ready-to-drink business, including Starbucks BAYA Energy in the U.S. and new Chilled Cup offerings in our international markets. The segment's operating margin was 42.7% in Q2, down 400 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to business mix shift driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance.\nMoving on to our guidance for the balance of our fiscal '22 year. Given the uncertainty around further mobility restrictions and lockdowns in China resulting from the government's strict zero-COVID policies as well as increasing inflationary headwinds, it's become increasingly difficult for us to predict the back half of the year with reasonable accuracy. Thus, as Howard mentioned, we believe the only responsible thing to do is suspend guidance for balance of this fiscal year.\nHowever, to provide additional insights, we believe our results for the balance of the year will be significantly pressured with heavier pressure in Q3. From a capital allocation perspective, although we suspended share repurchases for the balance of the fiscal year, we've returned more than $5 billion between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend during the first half of our fiscal year. We expect share repurchases made earlier in the year to contribute at least 1% to our FY '22 EPS growth. We will provide a comprehensive update on our business outlook and our capital allocation commitments for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. However, as Howard mentioned, we are confident the investments we are making in our partners, our stores and our brand will deliver significant returns in excess of historical levels, resulting in accelerated long-term growth.\nTo summarize, the 2 key takeaways from my prepared remarks today. Our Q2 performance underscored the strong customer demand across our business and around the world. We remain committed to the growth opportunity ahead in all channels and markets, creating and delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders, our partners, our customers and our shareholders long into the future.\nOnce again, the real credit for our success belongs to our Green Apron partners around the world who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience every day. That experience drove our growth and will continue to be the heart of our business as we reimagine the future of Starbucks together.\nWith that, Howard, Belinda, Brady and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Adam Brotman. Thank you.\nOperator?",

And with that, allow me to turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin R. Johnson\n\nCEO, President & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Before we dive into the quarter's results, I want to take a moment to reflect on the fact the world is now entering the third year of this pandemic and recognize that over this period, Starbucks has made significant progress driving our business recovery.\nThe last 2 years have been anything but linear. Many parts of the world continue to experience significant COVID-related disruptions, including Starbucks' 2 lead markets, United States and China. However, through a dynamic and challenging environment, 3 things have remained true for Starbucks: first, global consumer demand for Starbucks is strengthening across our offerings and throughout all dayparts. This is a result of our work over the past year to expand digital customer relationships, introduce new beverage offerings and provide a safe, familiar and convenient experience for our customers.\nSecond, we remain unwavering in the prioritizing the health and safety of our store partners and customers, even when the associated costs may create short-term earnings pressure. We have consistently provided best-in-class COVID benefits to our partners since this pandemic began. And third, the flexible operating protocols we established from the beginning of the pandemic continued to serve us well. The combination of these things has enabled us to adapt to near-term challenges while continuing to invest in what we know is a long-term opportunity for all stakeholders.\nStarbucks delivered record first quarter revenue of $8.1 billion, representing 19% growth. Global same-store sales grew 13%, demonstrating strong customer affinity for Starbucks. Demand for Starbucks continues to build, and we are fully committed to capitalizing on this momentum for the long term. That said, while we have seen extraordinary top line growth, we've also experienced extraordinary cost pressure, which impacted our margin performance.\nAs the Omicron variant began to quickly spread, it resulted in higher-than-anticipated costs in 3 key areas across our U.S. business, each of which impacted our results similarly. A highly transmissible Omicron variant amplified staffing shortages in our supply chain, resulting in higher-than-planned distribution and transportation costs. We also experienced a significant increase in our industry-leading COVID isolation pay for our partners, and we saw higher-than-anticipated costs from training and onboarding of new Starbucks partners.\nAs we navigate the near-term challenges of this latest COVID variant, we remain confident in our ability to rapidly adapt while continuing to drive our long-term agenda of share gains, growth and value creation.\nIn our other lead market, China, the zero-COVID policy there contributed to significant disruption to store hours and transaction volume. Net new store growth and performance remained strong, yet overall revenue and profitability came in below expectations. While we believe that these dynamics are contemporary, we are focused on appropriately navigating the evolving macro dynamics and balancing long-term investments in the business.\nI'll now provide more insight into our Q1 results and the actions we are taking to address the current state of our business, industry and overall economy while continuing to prioritize our partners and ensuring Starbucks delivers long-term profitable growth. In the U.S., we experienced very strong customer demand over the holiday season. Our ability to deliver the Starbucks Experience to our customers how, when and where they want, resulted in first quarter revenue of $5.3 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth of 23% was driven by a double-digit increase in customer traffic, highlighting our compelling holiday lineup and strong in-store and digital customer connection throughout the holiday season.\nCustomer demand increased through all dayparts and resulted in record Starbucks Card activations and reloads in excess of $3 billion. Starbucks Rewards grew 21% to a record 26.4 million 90-day active members. Average ticket grew mid-single digits, demonstrating our continued differentiation through customized premium beverages and compelling food options.\nPrior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, we were experiencing some inflationary pressures and staffing issues resulting from the broader pandemic. When the Omicron surge began, inflationary costs and staffing shortages were amplified, well in excess of our expectations. As I mentioned, 3 primary factors: on inflation, COVID-related pay and training and onboarding of new partners impacted our profitability to approximately the same degree, even while customer demand remained strong.\nNow let me outline the impacts we believe these will have for the near term and, more importantly, the actions we are taking to address each of them. Like many others in the industry, we felt the impact of Omicron in the wider COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we experienced a rapid increase in supply chain costs related to distribution and transportation as our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs. This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive spot market and alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand.\nAs a result, supply chain-driven inflationary costs were unexpectedly amplified by Omicron and rapidly accelerated in December, impacting our U.S. business by more than 170 basis points on margin in the quarter. As we entered fiscal year '22, we had estimated full year inflationary impacts of around 200 basis points on margin. For the balance of the year, we expect these costs to increase versus our previous estimate. Like most economists, we anticipate supply chain disruptions will continue for the foreseeable future.\nWe have already taken pricing actions this fiscal year, 1 in October 2021 and another in January 2022. And we have additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year, which play an important role to mitigate cost pressures, including inflation, as we position our business for the future. There are many factors that contribute to our thoughtful pricing strategy, including: the increasing U.S. inflation rate currently running at 7% or perhaps greater as well as wage, customer demand and other costs; second, the rapid spread of Omicron through the U.S. required us to quickly adapt store protocols.\nFrom our very beginning, and as we've demonstrated throughout this pandemic, Starbucks has always prioritized the health and wellness of our partners by offering some of the best benefits in the industry. This moment is no different. Our COVID vaccination pay has supported thousands of partners and the broader efforts in helping get more people vaccinated. And with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, we had more partners leverage our COVID isolation benefits as they were either home sick or home isolating after being exposed to the virus, which led to significantly higher COVID-related benefits paid than expected.\nWe expect similar usage of COVID isolation and vaccination pay through this next quarter, moderating in the back half of fiscal '22. Throughout this pandemic, COVID isolation pay has been a critically important partner benefit. To help offset the higher-than-expected expense of this benefit, we are taking the necessary measures to reduce spending in discretionary areas of our U.S. P&L. As an example, with strong customer demand, we believe we can tighten up a bit more in our G&A expenses, including promotional spend and marketing. We believe these measures are prudent as we work to balance increasing cost pressures with our commitment to our partners.\nFinally, with approximately 4 million Americans who have not yet returned to the workforce, nearly every business in the services industry is facing staffing challenges and increased turnover. The battle for talent is notable. While Starbucks has always been committed to attracting and retaining the best partners with our differentiated pay and benefits package, we too experienced staffing issues. In response to this challenge and as an employer of choice, we hired an increasing number of new partners into our business this past quarter, which rapidly increased our training costs well above historic levels. This investment is critical to the success of our business as we work to create a great Starbucks Experience where partners feel supported and customers feel uplifted.\nWe know from experience that the continued investments in our partners, both tenured and new, will continue to drive the levels of customer connection and overall productivity that support the long-term success and differentiation of our business. And we remain confident that the $1 billion investment in partner wages and hours that we announced on our fiscal '21 Q4 call is the right long-term investment to ensure we have the very best talent to support our business. In addition to these actions and as we highlighted on the last call, we continue to implement operational efficiencies throughout the organization to drive the productivity critical to our commitment to long-term margin expansion.\nIn summary, the demand in our U.S. market is very strong, and we have tremendous opportunity for continued growth, as highlighted by our robust revenue results. As a leadership team, we hold ourselves accountable to the actions we have outlined to ensure our revenue growth is also reflected in our bottom line. To deliver compelling financial results to all Starbucks' stakeholders, we must continue to balance ongoing profitability with long-term investments.\nTurning to China. We continue to grow our store footprint in Q1 as we surpassed 5,500 stores in the market. This brings our global store footprint to a record 34,317 stores. It's important to note that our latest generation of new stores in China continued to perform well as best-in-class store profitability and return on investment were achieved. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members in China reached nearly 18 million, an increase of 2.6 million versus prior year, with members contributing 75% of sales.\nMobility restrictions and the country's zero-COVID policy have presented significant headwinds, contributing to a minus 10% same-store comp after adjusting for the VAT subsidy from a year ago. We adhered to COVID health regulations and, as a result, experienced closures dynamic store protocols or reduced operations in 3/4 of our stores throughout China exiting Q1.\nThat said, our business in China continues to represent significant long-term growth. We are playing the long game as we navigate a dynamic environment. We are encouraged by the performance and growth in our digital offering as it drives new customer occasions and opens new channels of convenience. Digital ordering continues to resonate with customers, growing to a Q1 record 38% of sales. Customer demand was evident across both the morning and afternoon dayparts. This, coupled with our continued store expansion, is a testament to the significant growth opportunity in the market.\nThrough these challenges, however, our partners persevered and responded to ensure in-store safety by staffing health stations, taking temperatures and ensuring masks were worn by both partners and customers. Importantly, our customer connection scores were at an all-time high in the quarter. This is a testament to the resiliency of our partners and the strength of our brand, giving us confidence that as COVID-related restrictions eventually abate, our opportunity for growth in China remains as compelling as ever.\nLooking more broadly at the international markets outside of China, we saw strong results for the quarter. The broad portfolio of markets in our International segment, excluding China, delivered outstanding results this quarter, posting 27% revenue growth with strength across Europe, Latin America, Japan, Korea and broader Asia Pacific. This illustrates the power of a diversified portfolio and gives us confidence in our global growth potential.\nShifting from International, we continue to see impressive revenue growth from our Channel Development markets. And we are pleased with the continued performance of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé as Starbucks at-home coffee continues to gain market share over the prior year, driven by Starbucks by Nespresso. And through our North America costing partnership with PepsiCo, we recently announced our entrance into the energy category with Starbucks VIA Energy Drink, a ready-to-drink beverage crafted from caffeine naturally found in coffee fruit as well as antioxidants to give consumers a feel-good boost. Energy drinks represent a rapidly growing category. We believe this new beverage differentiates us, opening up another category in the portfolio for growth.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to highlight that this quarter's record top line performance in a uniquely challenging operating environment, along with the set of actions outlined above, gives us confidence in our growth at scale agenda. While quarterly results can be difficult to predict in this dynamic environment, our strong demand and operating flexibility throughout this pandemic have enabled us to build an even stronger, more resilient company.\nWhile we expect these complexities to persist through the near term, Starbucks is well positioned to adapt and continue to deliver great experiences for partners and customers. Consumer demand for Starbucks is strong across all markets and continues to grow. We will continue to balance appropriate levels of near-term profitability with the partner investments and innovations that drive customer loyalty and, in turn, long-term growth.\nFor over 2 years now, and thanks to our partners, our business has emerged stronger after each wave of a COVID surge has peaked, and we expect this will be the case as Omicron runs its course. We have significant growth opportunities ahead and the investments we are making position Starbucks to continue capturing share in the fast-growing coffee addressable market while driving double-digit earnings growth over the long term. With that, we are reiterating our fiscal '22 guidance for revenue but believe it is prudent to revise margin and earnings guidance to reflect the cost pressures that were amplified by the Omicron variant. We view these as near-term pressures, and we have a clear set of actions to manage through this moment. With that, I now turn the call over to Rachel to walk you through details of our Q1 results and fiscal '22 guidance components. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 performance showcased the strength of the Starbucks brand, underscored by strong customer demand despite intermittent COVID headwinds, which accelerated this quarter, given the highly transmissible Omicron variant. At the same time, it also highlighted continued industry pressures and operational challenges, which we are actively addressing as Kevin highlighted moments ago.\nStarbucks delivered global revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter, up 19% from the prior year, setting a Q1 record, primarily driven by the exceptional holiday performance in the U.S., coupled with strong results from our global portfolio with remarkable breadth and depth despite continued mobility disruptions to our China operations impacted by the country's zero-COVID policy.\nQ1 consolidated operating margin contracted 30 basis points from the prior year to 15.1% due primarily to significant investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as inflation, partially offset by sales leverage and pricing in North America. Q1 EPS was $0.72, up 18% from the prior year, reflecting strong revenue growth. However, it was lower than our expectations due primarily to our U.S. business, driven by the 3 key factors Kevin outlined: accelerated inflation, extended COVID-related pay and increased spend on new partner training and support costs.\nI will now provide some segment highlights for Q1. The North America segment delivered revenue of $5.7 billion in Q1, up 23% from the prior year, primarily driven by an 18% increase in comparable store sales, including a 12% increase in transactions and a 6% increase in average ticket. 2-year comp in this segment reached 12% for the quarter, representing the sixth quarter of sequential improvement and the highest 2-year comp since the onset of the pandemic despite modified store hours across many regions. Our average ticket remained elevated even as group ordering continues to normalize, driven by pricing, record-breaking food attach, which had its seventh consecutive quarter at an all-time high and strong holiday performance.\nOur drive-through windows and mobile orders continued to account for approximately [70%] of U.S. company-operated sales, offering our customers safe, convenient and personalized ways to engage with Starbucks. 53% of spend in our U.S. company-operated stores was generated by our Starbucks Rewards customer base with the 90-day active membership reaching 26.4 million, up 21% over the prior year, adding 1.6 million new active members in this quarter alone.\nNorth America's operating margin was 18.8% in Q1, up 10 basis points from the prior year as sales leverage, pricing, sourcing savings and the benefit of the North America trade area transformation were largely offset by investments in store partner wages, high inflation as well as increased spend on new partner training, onboarding and support costs to address labor market conditions.\nMoving on to International. In the International segment, we set a Q1 revenue record as the segment reached $1.9 billion, up 12% over the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korea market to a fully licensed business. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decrease in comparable store sales.\nExcluding a 3% decline attributable to lapping the prior year VAT benefit, the segment's comparable store sales were flat as reoccurring COVID resurgences severely hindered mobility and impacted our business in China, where the majority of stores were operating under elevated safety protocols and reduced store hours even as we exited the quarter.\nReflecting the pandemic-related safety and mobility restrictions in China, the market's comparable store sales declined 14% in Q1, including a 4% decrease from lapping the prior year VAT release. However, we remain committed to and focused on our growth strategy in the market. As a result, we opened 197 net new stores and entered 16 new cities in the quarter in China, both record highs for any Q1 period. Additionally, our over 5,500 stores in the market remain committed to elevating the Starbucks Experience, setting operational records with our highest customer engagement scores in the quarter and lowest partner turnover in the last 3 years.\nLast month, we also expanded Starbucks Delivers to the Meituan platforms market-wide, partnering with China's leading e-commerce service provider to enhance the customer experience, continuing with our plan to grow our delivery business in the quarters to come. Outside of China, a number of our international markets across our global portfolio saw a sustained recovery in Q1, including Japan and the U.K. contributing meaningfully to our revenue growth.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 18.3% in Q1, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits and strategic initiatives as well as higher profit and distribution costs from a sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage.\nMoving on to Channel Development. Revenue grew 12% to $417 million in Q1, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. Based on IRI and Euromonitor data, Starbucks once again retained the #1 brand position in both the U.S. at-home coffee and global ready-to-drink categories during the quarter, reinforcing customers' desire to replicate their Starbucks in-store experience and fulfill their Starbucks' taste profiles while at home or on the go.\nThe segment's operating margin was 43.9% in Q1, down 480 basis points from the prior year as our North American coffee partnership joint venture income declined due to supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures as well as business mix shifts.\nMoving on to our guidance for fiscal '22. We reiterate our fiscal '22 global comparable store sales growth guidance of high single digit and revenue guidance range of $32.5 billion to $33 billion. Considering meaningful margin headwinds that exist in this dynamic operating environment, with inflation at its highest level in decades, COVID-19 resurgences impacting our businesses globally and a continued industry-wide labor shortage, we believe it is prudent to revise both our fiscal '22 operating margin and EPS guidance at this time.\nBased on the latest trends in our outlook, we anticipate over 200 basis points of incremental margin pressure in fiscal '22 from inflation, COVID-related pay, new partner training and support costs as well as reduced sales from mobility restrictions combined. As Kevin outlined, however, we have and we will continue to take intentional steps to offset these pressures, including selectively accelerating price increases, tightly managing numerous cost areas as well as actioning throughput initiatives across our operations.\nWe also believe there will be some moderation in staffing-related costs specifically related to training expenses as our partner investments begin to translate into higher retention. Collectively, the margin benefits from these actions are expected to nearly offset the anticipated margin pressure. In addition to these actions, we will continue to prioritize investments that will drive our growth over the long term, including raising U.S. store partner wages as previously announced. As a result, we expect fiscal '22 GAAP margin to approach 16.5% and non-GAAP margin to approach 17%.\nMoving on to EPS. Given our Q1 results and margin pressures expected in the balance of the year, our fiscal '22 GAAP EPS is now expected to decline by a range of 4% to 6%. Additionally, we expect our fiscal '22 non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal '21 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in the non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs. The EPS growth range reflects our Q1 results, accounts for the appropriate steps we are taking to manage and drive the business and account for the impacts of the 3 headwinds we've discussed.\nIn terms of quarterly margin and EPS cadence, we expect headwinds to intensify in Q2 as Omicron disruptions escalated in January. While the intensity throughout Q2 is unknown, we expect Q2 quarterly non-GAAP EPS and margin to be below prior year levels, with significant improvement in Q3 coming from our margin enhancement actions materializing. Q4 is then expected to show continued recovery but at a more gradual pace, inclusive of the summer step-up in wage investments as we raise the U.S. average store hourly wage to $17. Assuming no other significant impacts, including further impacts from COVID, we anticipate our EPS to return to double-digit growth in fiscal '23 and beyond.\nAll other full year '22 guidance metrics, including global net new store count, CapEx, interest expense and tax rates are unchanged from what we previously communicated on our fourth quarter fiscal '21 earnings call. Despite the unexpected global impacts of Omicron or other potential variant resurgences, we remain confident in delivering outstanding top line growth in fiscal '22, enabled by incredible customer demand, our diversified portfolio and continued ability to deliver the valuable human connection to our customers in a safe, convenient and consistent manner.\nWe also continue to stand by our commitment to return $20 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years and have returned more than $4 billion in Q1 between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend. Finally, given the dynamic operating environment and the incremental cost pressures reflected in our fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect year-on-year margin improvement in fiscal '23 with a return to the long-term target of 18% to 19% in fiscal '24. Of course, all of these estimates presumes no new material business disruptions, whether from the pandemic or the broader economy.\nAlthough our efforts to adapt to the evolving market conditions may take longer than initially anticipated, our long-term growth model remains intact, guided by the belief that the success of our company starts with investing in our partners, which ultimately creates value for customers and for all Starbucks' stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nIn closing, the 3 key points summarizing my prepared remarks are: first, Q1 demonstrated our strong revenue growth and the resilience of our brand while also highlighting margin pressures, which we are addressing through purposeful actions; second, given the evolving macro and operating environment, we are revising our margin and EPS outlook for fiscal '22 while reaffirming strong top line growth; and finally, we remain committed to our long-term growth model.\nAs always, credit for our success today and tomorrow belongs to our passionate Starbucks partners around the world who deliver a safe, authentic and personalized Starbucks Experience to our customers with care and commitment. Our partners have our greatest respect and appreciation. With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Leo Tsoi. Thank you. Operator?",

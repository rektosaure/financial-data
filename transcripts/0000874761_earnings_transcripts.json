My name is Claire and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions].\nI will now hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations from AES to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; Ricardo Falu, our Chief Operating Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2025 financial review call. Today, I will address our year-to-date progress on our financial and strategic objectives, and speak to key development in our renewables and utility businesses. Following my remarks, Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will further discuss our financial performance and outlook.\nFirst, I am pleased to reaffirm our full year 2025 guidance and long-term growth rates, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. We are executing according to our plan, and we are well positioned going into 2026. We remain fully on track with our credit ratings and have received credit opinions from all 3 major agencies confirming our investment-grade rating with stable outlook, including from Moody's in September.\nSecond, we are confident that we will sign 4 gigawatts of new PPAs this year, as we deliver the energy solutions that our customers need at attractive returns. Year-to-date, we have signed 2.2 gigawatts and expect to sign at least an additional 1.8 gigawatts before the end of the year as we are in advanced negotiations on several large projects. Similarly, we're on schedule to complete 3.2 gigawatts of construction projects this year with 2.9 gigawatts already completed year-to-date. An additional 4.8 gigawatts of our 11.1 gigawatt backlog is under construction and expected to be completed through 2027. We're also repowering the 1.2 gigawatts of natural gas at AES Indiana, which is scheduled to be operational next year. This significant construction program provides clear line of sight to EBITDA growth through our guidance period and beyond.\nTurning to Slide 5. We have seen a 46% increase in our renewables EBITDA year-to-date, driven primarily from the organic growth of new projects coming online and the maturing of our U.S. renewables businesses. By year-end, the installed capacity of our U.S. business will be almost 60% larger than it was just 2 years ago. We are seeing projects with higher returns come online as we benefit from substantial economies of scale in purchasing, construction and operation. These benefits are particularly evident as the average size of our projects has increased by over 50% over the past 5 years.\nTurning to Slide 6. We're also benefiting from the completion of projects serving data centers that we have signed over the last few years. Of 8.2 gigawatts, 4.2 gigawatts are in operation and 4 gigawatts are in our backlog. Nearly half of these remaining 4 gigawatts are under construction and will be added to our fleet in the next 18 months. Additionally, and leveraging on our development capabilities, this quarter, we signed a development transfer agreement, or DTA with a large data center customer to provide them with powered land for a data center site adjacent to 2 of our power projects.\nIn the past, we have signed DTAs with utility customers to develop and transfer power prices. But this is our first involving the transfer of a data center site. We will provide more details on this powered land solution in the future as we continue completing milestones and are ready to announce it with the customer.\nMoving to Slide 7. We continue to see very strong demand across the sector with our customers overwhelmingly focused on time to power. Given the overall scarcity of ready-to-build projects, AES is well positioned to meet the urgent need for energy due to our advanced pipeline of development projects, robust domestic supply chain with no FERC exposure and secured tax credit position. As a reminder, our 7.5-gigawatt U.S. backlog is entirely safe harbor. And in our pipeline, we have an additional 4 gigawatts with safe harbor protections.\nWe also have line of sight to safe harbor an additional 3 to 4 gigawatts before July 4, 2026, enabling us to bring online projects with tax credits through 2030. As we move toward the end of the decade, our safe harbor projects that qualify for tax credits will give us a growing competitive advantage. This will help us serve our customers with reliable and low-cost power.\nMoving to our U.S. utilities, beginning on Slide 8. We are focused on our core mission of serving our customers with affordable and reliable power as we address the increased demand that we are seeing in our service territories. Across Indiana and Ohio, we're among the lowest cost providers in each state, a position we expect to maintain following the resolution of our active rate cases.\nTurning to Indiana on Slide 9. Earlier this year, we filed for a rate review with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This rate case represents our first using a forward-looking test year, bringing us in line with the rest of the electric utilities in Indiana. We are committed to maintaining bill affordability, and we have been disciplined in holding our operations and maintenance costs flat for the last 5 years. As such, our rate increase request is less than the cumulative impact of inflation since our last rate adjustment. I am pleased to report that in October, we filed a partial settlement agreement which included parties such as the City of Indianapolis. We expect the final order in Q2 of next year. We still expect our residential rates to be at least 15% lower than the average rates in the state.\nFurthermore, we're making excellent progress on our generation program at AES Indiana, which includes the construction of new facilities to replace aging infrastructure and improve system reliability. Earlier this year, we brought online a 200-megawatt Pike County project, the largest energy storage facility in MISO, and we're on track to complete an additional 295 megawatts of new capacity by the end of this year.\nMoving to Slide 10. Last week, we filed our integrated resource plan with IURC, laying out a 20-year outlook and short-term action plan for our generation portfolio. Our IRP submission evaluated scenarios with and without new data center load as we see the potential for significant new demand in our service territory, with new load coming online towards the end of the decade. As we work with data center customers, we are committed to ensuring that new load will lower cost for all existing customers as we spread fixed costs across a larger customer base. We will announce these arrangements with more specificity in due course.\nTurning to AES Ohio on Slide 11, where we have 2.1 gigawatts of signed data center agreement and expect more to come. I should note that in Ohio, our data center-related investments are for transmission and are supported by FERC formula rates with no regulatory lag. By 2027, we expect transmission to represent 40% of our total rate base.\nWe are now also in the final stages of our distribution rate review. Since our last call, we filed a unanimous settlement, including all customer classes and PUCO staff. The settlement includes an annual revenue increase of approximately $168 million and an ROE of nearly 10%. We expect to have our final order in the very near future with rates effective as early as this month.\nLooking ahead, we plan to file our next rate review next week as we work towards the transition in Ohio's regulatory framework away from the existing ESP model. In this filing, we will be using forward-looking test years from 2027 to 2029 as we seek to further optimize our current rate structure and reduce regulatory lag.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results in our 2025 guidance and parent capital allocation. First, turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $830 million versus $698 million a year ago. This was driven by significant growth from new renewables projects, rate-based investment at our U.S. utilities, and continued progress on our cost savings program announced on the fourth quarter call. We have already realized the majority of the $150 million in cost savings for this year, and we are on track to achieve a $300 million annual run rate in 2026. These drivers were partially offset by the sale of AES Brazil and the sell-downs of AES Ohio and our Global Insurance business.\nTurning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.75 per share versus $0.71 in the prior year. Drivers were similar to adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense and lower renewable tax attribute recognition, mainly due to timing. We also benefited from a slightly lower adjusted tax rate.\nNext, I'll cover the performance drivers within each of our strategic business units. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 15. Our strong growth was primarily driven by the 3 gigawatts of new capacity brought online since Q3 2024. Our results were also driven by the continued benefit from cost reductions and scaling down of development spending as our pipeline has continued to mature. Lastly, the net effect of moving Chile renewables to the renewables SBU this year was more than offset by the sale of our 5 gigawatt AES Brazil business.\nTurning to Slide 16. We've made excellent progress so far this year toward achieving our full year renewables EBITDA guidance and have already exceeded our full year 2024 EBITDA in just the first 3 quarters of 2025. We expect to continue this momentum in the year to go, driven by our expanded operating fleet and full realization of our cost savings objective. As the size of our operating portfolio increases, while our development spending and overhead decline, our operating margins are significantly improving. In addition, hydro conditions in Colombia have normalized compared to last year, and we expect to realize the largest benefit in our fourth quarter results.\nTurning back to our third quarter results on Slide 17, in the Utilities SBU, higher adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, in the quarter was mostly driven by the $1.3 billion of rate base investments we've made over the previous 4 quarters to improve reliability and customer experience. This was partially offset by the 30% sell-down of AES Ohio that closed in April. At our Energy Infrastructure SBU, higher EBITDA primarily reflects our acquisition of the remaining ownership in the Cochrane coal plant, cost savings and the commencement of operations at our Gatun gas plant last year. This was partially offset by the Chile renewable assets moving to our renewables segment in 2025.\nFinally, EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU was relatively flat versus a year ago, with no material drivers.\nTurning to our 2025 EBITDA guidance on Slide 20. We have already achieved more than 3/4 of the midpoint of our guidance in the year-to-date. And I am highly confident in our full year range of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by the continued strong increase in contributions from new renewables projects, rate base investment in our U.S. utilities, normalized results at our Colombian hydro assets and the full realization of our $150 million cost savings target.\nLooking at the right-hand side, we are also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $2.10 to $2.26. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we expect slightly higher tax credit recognition on new renewables projects, partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of new debt for our growth investments and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate.\nLooking beyond this year on Slide 21, we're also reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for adjusted EBITDA through 2027 from the midpoint of guidance we gave at our Investor Day in 2023. Notably, we expect a strong step-up over the next 2 years with our growth rate increasing to the low teens next year. We expect to have significantly less drag from asset sales and coal retirements going forward. And instead, our overall results will be driven by new EBITDA contributions from our 11.1 gigawatt renewables backlog and 11% utilities rate base growth.\nIt is important to highlight that our long-term guidance through 2027 understates the actual run rate earnings power of our portfolio. Looking beyond 2027, we expect to earn an incremental $400 million of run rate EBITDA. This is from projects that we expect to be either still under construction at the end of 2027 or that will come online during 2027 and will contribute a full year of EBITDA in 2028. This $400 million does not require any additional project development or PPA signings, but represents the full realization of investments we'll have already made by the end of our guidance period.\nNow let's turn to our 2025 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 22. Sources reflect approximately $2.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including achieving upper half of our $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion parent free cash flow target. We achieved our asset sales target with the sell-down of our global insurance business in the second quarter, and we expect to borrow an additional $500 million at the parent to continue funding growth.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return more than $500 million of dividends to shareholders this year while investing approximately $1.8 billion towards new growth, primarily in the renewables and utilities businesses. We have also repaid approximately $400 million of subsidiary debt. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remains strong, consistent with our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated Moody's FFO to net debt metric is tracking ahead of the agreed path of 10% to 11% in 2025 and we are confident in achieving the 12% target by the end of 2026.\nIn summary, we've demonstrated the high growth of our renewables and utilities businesses and our excellent track record of completing projects on time and on budget. Since we initiated our long-term plan in 2023, we brought 10 gigawatts of projects online and signed another 12 gigawatts, while investing nearly $4 billion in the rate base at our U.S. utilities. We are extremely well positioned to achieve our 2025 guidance and long-term growth rates through 2027, and our plan remains largely derisked. I look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Before we open the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased I am with our execution this year. We remain firmly on track to achieve all of our strategic and financial objectives. And we have made significant progress in growing our renewables business as evidenced by the 46% increase in renewables EBITDA year-to-date. The primary driver of this EBITDA growth is the 3 gigawatts of new capacity completed over the last 12 months. Our construction program provides clear line of sight to continued EBITDA growth through our guidance period and beyond. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our strategy and our ability to bring new projects online efficiently and at scale.\nAs a diversified power company, we are well positioned to deliver the technology and solutions our customers need, whether through renewables, our utilities or our energy infrastructure business. Our safe harbor pipeline, a robust domestic supply chain and deep customer relationships give us a competitive advantage as we meet the growing demand for reliable, low-cost power. I am confident that our continued focus on execution will drive value for our shareholders as we move into 2026 and beyond.\nWith that, I'd like to ask the operator to open up the call for questions."

Today, I'm pleased to reaffirm both our 2025 guidance and our long-term growth targets. Our business remains resilient, and we continue to execute on our strategy, which I will discuss in more detail.\nFollowing my remarks, Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook. Before delving into our second quarter results, allow me to share a few thoughts regarding the state of the electricity market in the U.S. Obviously, the past couple of months have seen major policy announcements, which will have a significant impact on the sector. Not to get distracted by some of the noise surrounding these developments. It's important to keep in mind key market fundamentals.\nDemand for energy in the U.S. is growing rapidly by historical measures. Prices are rising, and the bulk of new additions over the next 5 years will be renewables and energy storage. These are the technologies that can be feasibly built, given their shorter time to power, advanced development pipeline existing supply chains, competitive levelized cost of energy and customer preference.\nCurrent government policies aim to increase the amount of future power coming from fossil fuels nuclear and enhanced geothermal. While measures can be taken to increase generation from existing thermal plants, new additions will take years to materially come online, some more than others. In the meantime, AES has a mature pipeline of renewables and battery storage with a substantial safe harbored backlog of signed PPAs, positioning us to meet our clients' growing energy needs.\nAs an all-of-the-above energy company, we had the capabilities to deliver those technologies that are most cost competitive and demanded by our customers. We see our business model as supplying not a specific technology, but the electric energy and capacity in the shape, cost and reliability, the market demands. Over many years, AES has demonstrated its flexibility and innovation time and again.\nNow turning to our results, beginning on Slide 4. We're executing well and on track to achieve all of our financial metrics. Our performance was in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA of $681 million and adjusted EPS of $0.51. We are seeing significant growth in our renewables SBU with adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $240 million, representing overall growth of 56% versus Q2 last year.\nThis growth is directly related to the 3.2 gigawatts of new projects that we have added to our portfolio over the last 4 quarters. We are also seeing the benefits of more projects with higher returns, which we forecasted earlier last year and are now hitting our results as these projects come online. We're on track to add a total of 3.2 gigawatts of new projects in operation in 2025.\nYear-to-date, we have completed construction of 1.9 gigawatts, and we are approximately 80% complete on the remaining 1.3 gigawatts. I am pleased to report that our progress so far this year includes the completion of the 1-gigawatt Bellefield 1 solar plus storage project, which is the first phase and the largest project of its kind in the country. As part of our construction efforts, we utilized our AI robotic solar installation technology, Maximo, which makes construction significantly faster, less labor intensive and more cost effective.\nSince our last call, we have signed PPAs for an additional 1.6 gigawatts of new projects, including 650 megawatts with Meta, bringing our backlog to 12 gigawatts. The 1.6 gigawatts of new PPAs is entirely with data center customers, further solidifying our position as the leading provider of renewables to this customer segment.\nNow turning to Slide 5. Our business is resilient to changes in renewables policy, whether it's the new legislation signed by Congress, the prospect of additional tariffs or changes to IRS guidelines around tax credits. We have significant protections due to the actions we have taken over the last several years, including safe harboring, ensuring a U.S. supply chain and avoiding projects on federal land.\nLet me also emphasize that for the majority of our business, any of the recent changes in U.S. policy are largely inconsequential. This includes our entire operating portfolio, our utilities and our international business.\nTurning to Slide 6. We feel very confident in the strength of our backlog of renewables and energy storage projects, which have signed contracts that are not yet operational. Of this 12-gigawatt backlog, 4.1 gigawatts are international, selling primarily to mining companies and data centers with no exposure to U.S. policy.\nLooking at our 7.9 gigawatt U.S. backlog we plan to place in service 6 gigawatts before year-end 2027, all of which qualify for existing tax credits under recent legislation. Of the remaining 1.9 gigawatts coming online after 2027, nearly all is safe harbored under the current treasury guidance. Even looking out to 2028 and beyond, our pipeline includes an additional 4 gigawatts of projects that are expected to be added to our backlog over the coming year.\nI should add that 35% of our U.S. pipeline is energy storage, which will be supported by tax credits from start of construction through 2033. In short, our backlog is well protected, and we have a long runway of projects that we expect to bring online with tax incentives.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our supply chain strategy also provides us with strong protection from changes in U.S. policy or potential future tariffs. All of our major equipment is now either on-site are coming from U.S.-based suppliers with their own supply chains diversified outside of China. We have essentially eliminated any potential impact from previously announced tariffs and our projects comply with the restrictions on foreign entities of concern or FEOC.\nNow turning to Slide 8 and our future growth. Even as tax credits expire, we expect strong demand, which will enable us to maintain or improve our existing project returns and continue to rapidly grow our EBITDA. We are uniquely positioned as the top provider of renewables to data center companies with over 11 gigawatts of agreements signed to date, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial objectives for the following 3 reasons.\nFirst, we're seeing robust demand for electricity, driven primarily by the rapid growth of data centers. Meeting this demand in the U.S. will require over 600 terawatt hours of additional power generated by the end of the decade, which is roughly equivalent to the current ERCOT system. With this backdrop, as you can see on Slide 9, the corporate PPA market for renewables has a long history of adjusting to account for changes in market conditions with average contract prices moving as the underlying cost of building new projects has evolved. It is worth noting that for data centers, electricity represents less than 10% of total lifetime cost on average.\nSecond, turning to Slide 10. Renewables offer a competitive levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, for new generation, even without tax credits. Over the past year, the cost of a new gas turbine has more than doubled, and lead times have stretched to 4 years or more. Additionally, new gas pipelines have yet to be approved, permitted and built. As a result, a surge in new gas plants coming online will likely take time.\nAnd third, our strategy remains centered on meeting our customer needs. Today, customers are asking for renewables and storage because they can be deployed quickly and at scale. I should add that AES has extensive gas development capabilities, and we are focused on delivering those solutions that our large data center customers are requesting.\nFinally, turning to Slide 11 and the robust growth program we're undertaking at our U.S. utilities. We are executing on the largest investment program in the history of both AES Indiana and AES Ohio to improve customer reliability and support economic development. In 2025, across these utilities, we're on track to invest approximately $1.4 billion in areas such as hardening the distribution network, smart grid, new generation and transmission build-out for data centers.\nAt AES Indiana, we are making significant progress on our generation buildout. Earlier this year, we completed the Pike County energy storage project, which includes 200 megawatts of installed capacity and 800-megawatt hours of dispatchable energy, the largest operational battery project in MISO. We're also on track to bring online the Petersburg Energy Center, a 250-megawatt solar and 180-megawatt hour energy storage facility by the end of the year.\nFurthermore, we're on schedule with repowering 2 of the Petersburg units from coal to natural gas. We expect this project to be completed in 2026. This quarter, we also filed petitions for a regulatory rate review with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This rate case represents our first using a forward-looking test year, which will reduce regulatory lag and enable a more efficient investment program as we work to best serve our customers with cost-effective and reliable electricity service.\nIn AES Ohio, our current regulatory rate review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is on track for a timely order, and we're optimistic that we will be able to reach a settlement agreement in the third quarter. In addition, with the passage of House Bill 15 this spring, we are working towards a new regulatory framework that will incorporate 3 forward-looking test years, significantly reducing regulatory lag in Ohio.\nWith our current ESP regulatory structure in place until early 2027, we expect to file for new rates later this year, which will include 2027 to 2029 as the test years.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share that AES had a great second quarter, keeping us well on track towards our full year 2025 guidance targets. First, turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $681 million versus $658 million a year ago. This was driven by significant growth from new renewables projects and the positive impact from cost reductions we announced on our fourth quarter call.\nThese were partially offset by several portfolio changes, including the prior year Warrior Run coal PPA monetization, the sale of AES Brazil and the 30% sell-down of AES, Ohio. Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.51 per share versus $0.38 in the prior year. In addition to the EBITDA growth drivers, also increased as a result of $185 million of higher U.S. renewable tax attributes. This strong growth was partially offset by higher parent interest expense and a higher adjusted tax rate.\nNext, I'll cover the performance drivers within each of our strategic business units on the next 4 slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 15, the 56% increase in EBITDA was as expected and puts us well on our way to achieving our full year guidance of $890 million to $960 million. This was primarily driven by 3.2 gigawatts of new capacity brought online since Q2 2024 as well as the positive impacts from the cost reductions and scaling down of our development spending that we discussed on our fourth quarter call.\nThis year, hydrology has normalized in Colombia, improving results versus the prior year. The net effect of moving Chile renewables to the renewables SBU this year was offset by the sale of our 5 gigawatt AES Brazil business. In the utilities SBU, lower adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, in the quarter was mostly driven by planned outages and the sell-down of AES Ohio that closed in April. These results were fully anticipated in our guidance, and we expect significant growth in the Utilities SBU in the year to go, driven by new investments in the rate base.\nTurning to our energy infrastructure SBU on Slide 17. Lower EBITDA versus Q2 2024 primarily reflects the prior year recognition of the Warrior Run coal PPA monetization and Chile renewable assets moving to our renewables segment in 2025, partially offset by our acquisition of the remaining ownership in the Cochrane coal plant. Excluding these portfolio changes, energy infrastructure EBITDA would have increased by $23 million as a result of higher availability across the fleet.\nFinally, lower EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU primarily reflects AES' share of the lower results reported by Fluence in their fiscal second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 19. We are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion, driven by the robust 51% growth in our renewables business year-to-date and our strong position heading into the second half of this year. Growth in the year to go will be driven by the 3.7 gigawatts of projects brought online in 2024, the 1.9 gigawatts already brought online year-to-date and the additional 1.3 gigawatts we will bring online through the end of the year.\nOur business has reached a level of scale and maturity that allows us to operate even more effectively and efficiently, which is improving EBITDA margins. As I mentioned, hydrology conditions in Colombia have normalized, and we see our hydro plants well positioned to hit their targets through the end of the year. We expect 7% year-over-year growth at our utilities SBU, and driven by the $1.3 billion of rate base investment we've made over the last 12 months. We have already locked in the cost savings actions implemented during the first quarter, which will yield at least the $150 million savings target we discussed on our fourth quarter call.\nTo put this year into context, when adjusted to exclude the impacts of asset sales, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be approximately 11%. Looking beyond 2025, asset sales will be less of a driver due to the substantial progress we've already made. This means that adjusted EBITDA growth will significantly accelerate in 2026 as the strong growth in our renewables and utilities businesses will not be offset by significant asset sales. As a result, we still expect at least low teens EBITDA growth in 2026, putting us well on track to achieve our long-term growth rate through 2027.\nNow looking at our 2025 adjusted earnings per share on Slide 20. We are reaffirming our guidance of $2.10 to $2.26, which exceeds the midpoint of the 7% to 9% long-term growth rate we introduced back in 2021. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we expect higher interest expense as a result of new debt for our growth investments and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate. We expect to benefit from higher tax credit monetization in the year to go as we complete an additional 600 megawatts of projects in the U.S. and expect these tax attributes to be weighted approximately equally between the third and fourth quarters.\nNow let's turn to our 2025 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21. Sources reflect approximately $2.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including achieving the upper half of our $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion of parent free cash flow target, reflecting double-digit year-over-year growth. Additional sources include the sell-down of our global insurance business that closed in the second quarter, and we expect to borrow an additional $500 million at the parent to support our attractive growth investment plan.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year with our $0.70 per share annual dividend, while investing approximately $1.8 billion toward new growth, primarily in the renewables and utilities businesses. We have also repaid approximately $400 million of subsidiary debt, in line with our balance sheet optimization objectives.\nTurning to Slide 22. We are reaffirming our long-term growth rate for adjusted EBITDA of 5% to 7%, driven by renewables growth of 19% to 21% and and utilities growth of 13% to 15%. We are also reaffirming our long-term growth rates for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. I want to emphasize that the recently passed Reconciliation Bill does not impact the growth plan included in our long-term guidance.\nAs Andres discussed, all projects coming online through year-end 2027 qualify to receive existing tax credits under the recently passed legislation. Additionally, we have either already taken delivery of key components for our backlog projects or we have secured domestic supply chains, which mitigate impacts of new tariffs. These actions give us clear line of sight to achieving our long-term guidance. As a reminder, AES' adjusted EBITDA does not include renewables tax credit. As a result, we do not expect any reduction in adjusted EBITDA from the eventual sunsetting of renewable tax credits.\nI would also like to share a few thoughts on our balance sheet. Our parent free cash flow to parent debt metric in the second quarter improved versus a year ago from 19% to 25%, and we remain on track to reach our 12% FFO to debt target with Moody's by the end of next year. Our plan through 2027 is fully self-funded with internally generated cash flow, tax capital, partner capital and incremental debt capacity.\nAs we consider how the business will evolve with the step down of tax credits toward the end of the decade and beyond, we feel confident in the resilience of our business due to our industry-leading position with data centers. Data center customers have an incredible need for new power and future expirations of renewables incentives are unlikely to slow this down. Our expectation is that PPA prices will adjust to fully remunerate invested capital at attractive returns.\nIn other words, while future projects without tax incentives would require additional debt and equity to replace tax value monetization, those projects will also earn higher cash and EBITDA to remunerate that additional capital and achieve our target returns. This also means that we could generate similar EBITDA and cash growth with less megawatts and without increasing capital needs. We will maintain this flexibility to scale our growth investments to be in line with available capital sources within AES and our partners.\nLooking beyond 2027, our growth will continue to be funded primarily with internally generated cash partner capital and debt capacity in line with our investment-grade credit rating. AES' future growth rates will be strong as declines we've seen in our energy infrastructure SBU, related to asset sales and coal retirements will be largely behind us, allowing the high growth rates of renewables and utilities to dominate AES' overall rate of growth.\nIn summary, I am very pleased with the progress we've made toward our financial objectives for 2025 and beyond as our business strategy and execution continue to prove resilient and successful. With more than half of the year behind us, I am confident we will achieve our 2025 objectives and look forward to providing an update on next quarter's call.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Before opening up the call to questions, I will share some closing thoughts. AES' business is resilient, and we are reaffirming all of our 2025 and longer-term financial and business objectives. We're on track to complete 3.2 gigawatts of construction in full year 2025 and have signed 2 gigawatts of new PPAs so far this year.\nOur backlog of 12 gigawatts of signed PPAs is either international or safe harbor and the majority will be completed by 2027. AES' Renewables adjusted EBITDA grew by 56% in the quarter as we delivered on our construction projects. At the same time, our balance sheet metrics are on track to meet all requirements to maintain our triple investment grade.\nOur resilience is the result of years of preparation of creating a domestic supply chain, a safe harbored backlog and pipeline and being the preferred provider of the fastest-growing market segment, namely data centers and corporate clients. AES has earned a reputation as the most reliable developer and builder of renewable projects as well as the most innovative company in our sector.\nWe see ourselves as a provider of electric energy and capacity with the cost, shape and carbon intensity that our clients demand. AES will continue to deliver the solutions our customers need as we always have done in the past. For all of these reasons, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments through our guidance period and continue to show strong growth beyond.\nWith that, I would ask the operator to open up the call for questions."

My name is Emily, and I'll be moderating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; Ricardo Falu, our Chief Operating Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2025 financial review call. Today, I'm very pleased to reaffirm both our 2025 guidance and long-term growth rate targets, which reflect our strong execution to date as well as the resilience of our business overall. I will discuss this in more detail and provide an update on the robust growth program at our U.S. utilities. Following my remarks, Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook.\nBeginning on Slide 3 with our first quarter results. Our financial performance was in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA of $591 million and adjusted EPS of $0.27. We completed the construction of 643 megawatts and signed or were awarded 443 megawatts of new PPAs, bringing our backlog to 11.7 gigawatts. We have achieved our asset sale proceeds target for the year, including the sale of a minority stake in our global insurance company, AGIC, for $450 million.\nNow turning to the resilience of our business model and portfolio. Our execution is proceeding as planned, and we expect to hit all of our financial metrics for the year. We have positioned ourselves for success even in the face of uncertainty around tariffs, changes to the Inflation Reduction Act or potential recession. Our business model is based on long-term contracted generation with creditworthy offtakers as well as growth in our U.S. regulated utilities. Our contracting, financing and supply chain strategies have all been designed to minimize the impact of economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, energy prices and tariffs. As a result, we have clear visibility into our future financial performance. I'll first discuss the performance of our renewable business and then address the ways we have ensured that this business is resilient to macroeconomic and policy shifts.\nTurning to Slide 4. A major driver of our renewables EBITDA growth this year is the approximately 3 gigawatts of new projects we expect to bring online. I'm pleased to say that we are fully on track with more than 600 megawatts already completed, including the 250-megawatt Morris Solar project in Missouri serving Microsoft. Our remaining projects under construction for the year are now approximately 80% complete. Our 1-gigawatt Bellefield 1 project, which includes 500 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of storage, is virtually complete, and we will be fully operational this summer. This is the first phase of what will be a 2-gigawatt project and the largest solar plus storage plant ever built in the United States, all of which is contracted with Amazon.\nMoving on to Slide 5. Our supply chain strategy provides us strong protections from any current or potential future tariffs as well as from the impact of inflation. Of the 7 gigawatts in our backlog scheduled to come online in the U.S. between 2025 and 2027, nearly all of the CapEx is protected with 0 exposure to tariffs as the equipment is already in the U.S., in transit or contracted to be produced domestically. Our tariff exposure is limited to a small quantity of batteries that are being imported from Korea for projects coming online in 2026 with a maximum potential exposure of $50 million, which we are actively working to further mitigate. This represents just 0.3% of the total U.S. CapEx and is well within the normal project contingency.\nI would like to emphasize that our U.S. supply chain protects us from any potential tariffs that could be announced, including reciprocal tariffs. We also serve our corporate customers outside the U.S. where we continue to see substantial demand. Contracts that we are signing outside the U.S. are benefiting from lower equipment prices as the result of the increase in international equipment supply, with solar panels typically 1/3 the cost in Chile versus the U.S.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our business is also well protected from possible changes to U.S. renewable policy for several reasons. First, we are the top electricity provider to premier corporate clients, including data center customers that require capacity that can come online relatively quickly. We have signed agreements for 9.5 gigawatts with data center companies, more than anyone else in the sector. There are a few others in the industry who can develop, build and operate the projects we offer, which are often large, geographically diverse and with customized commercial structures.\nFurthermore, with our extensive history of working with large corporate customers, our development projects are tailored to meet their specific needs. We believe our customers will have strong demand for renewables in any scenario. Through the end of the decade, Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees increased electricity demand requiring at least 425 gigawatts of new capacity. While AES is committed to serving our customers with an all-of-the-above strategy, including new gas generation, we see renewables as the primary source of new energy to serve this demand for the following reasons. First, they offer the fastest time to power, given their short construction period and advanced permitting and interconnection positions. Second, the fact that they are a low-cost source of power, particularly considering the rapidly rising cost of gas turbines and long lead times. And third, the price stability that they offer customers once contracted, unlike thermal power, which is subject to fluctuating fuel prices.\nIn addition, roughly 1/3 of our backlog is in international markets where we develop, build and operate renewable projects without tax credits, usually with higher returns than in the U.S. In the absence of tax credit, projects have higher net capital needs but PPA prices are also higher to account for this funding structure. In these cases, we earn higher EBITDA per megawatt and are able to achieve our financial targets with fewer projects.\nTurning to Slide 7. Another reason for our confidence in the resilience of our business is that nearly our entire U.S. backlog has safe harbor protections. Once a project starts construction or incurs 5% of the cost of materials, the project has safe harbor protections and has a period of 4 years to be placed in service and begin receiving tax credits. For example, any project that reaches start of construction milestones in 2025 is safe harbored through 2029.\nTurning to Slide 8. We're also resilient to any economic downturn. Our business is heavily contracted with approximately 2/3 of our EBITDA coming from long-term contracted generation, essentially all of which are take-or-pay and not tied to underlying demand conditions. Looking to the future, nearly all of our growth through 2027 is already secured through our 11.7-gigawatt backlog of signed long-term contracts. At the same time we sign our PPAs, we contractually lock in all major capital costs, EPC arrangements and hedge our long-term financing. This approach gives us clear line of sight to our future EBITDA.\nWe have also achieved our asset sale proceeds target for the year with the sale of a minority interest in our captive insurance company, and we have closed the sell-down of AES Ohio. Furthermore, with our March debt issuance, we have successfully completed all financings needed to address our 2025 debt maturities, and we have hedged 100% of our benchmark interest rate exposure for all corporate financings through 2027.\nNext, I'll discuss the robust growth program we're undertaking at our U.S. utilities on Slide 9. We are executing on the largest investment program in the history of both AES Indiana and AES Ohio as we work to improve customer reliability and support economic development. This year, we're on track to invest approximately $1.4 billion across the 2 utilities to support areas such as hardening the distribution network, smart grid, new generation and transmission buildout for data centers. We signed agreements for 2.1 gigawatts of new data centers in AES Ohio's service territory. We are beginning construction on new transmission to serve this load.\nThis summer, we'll be breaking ground on the $500 million transmission investment needed to serve a new Amazon data center in Fayette County. Additionally, last month, we completed the sale of a 30% stake in AES Ohio for $544 million to CDPQ, a global investment partner that also owns 30% of AES Indiana. This partnership helped support capital requirements for their substantial growth programs while also strengthening our balance sheet.\nNow turning to AES Indiana. We're continuing to invest in new generation to support our customers with affordable and reliable power. In March, we brought online the Pipe County Energy Storage project, which includes 200 megawatts of installed capacity and 800 megawatt hours of dispatchable energy, the largest operational battery project in MISO. We continue to make progress on the Petersburg Energy Center, a 250-megawatt solar and 180 megawatt hour energy storage facility, which we expect to be operational by the end of the year. And in April, we received final regulatory approval for the 170-megawatt cross-buying solar plus storage project, which we expect to bring online in 2027. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, our 2025 full year guidance and our parent capital allocation plan. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA was $591 million in the first quarter versus $640 million a year ago. This decline was anticipated in our guidance and was primarily driven by prior year revenues from the accelerated monetization of the Warrior Run PPA and the sale of our 5-gigawatt AES Brazil business but partially offset by growth in our renewables and utilities businesses.\nTurning to Slide 12. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27 versus $0.50 last year and was also in line with our expectations. Drivers include the prior year Warrior Run PPA monetization, the timing of U.S. renewables tax attribute recognition, higher parent interest and the prior year tax benefit associated with our transition to a more U.S.-oriented holding company structure. This was partially offset by higher contributions from our utilities SBU. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or strategic business units on the next 4 slides.\nBeginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 13. Higher EBITDA of approximately 45% year-over-year was driven primarily by contributions from new projects, which includes projects brought online over the prior 4 quarters. In addition, the renewables segment now includes all of our renewables in Chile which were a part of the energy infrastructure SBU in prior years. This change was offset by the EBITDA impact from the sale of AES Brazil in the fourth quarter of last year. With this quarter's results, we are fully on track to achieve our full year renewables SBU guidance of $890 million to $960 million.\nOur construction program is proceeding on schedule. Cost savings measures have been implemented and we have already seen hydrological conditions in Colombia normalize year-to-date. In other words, our main segment drivers are greatly derisked, and we're well on our way to achieving 60% renewables growth year-over-year.\nTurning to Slide 14. Higher adjusted PTC at our utilities SBU was mostly driven by tax attributes from the completion of the Pipe County Energy Storage project, new rates implemented in Indiana in May of last year, demand growth and favorable weather in the U.S. Lower EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects prior year revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the coal PPA at our Warrior Run plant as well as Chile renewables moving to the renewables segment. Finally, lower EBITDA at our new energy technologies SBU reflects lower contributions from Fluence in the first quarter.\nNow turning to our guidance beginning on Slide 17. We are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. We continue to see strong growth in our renewables SBU and expect our utilities businesses to grow approximately 7% this year despite the sell-down of AES Ohio. The cost savings actions we announced on our February call have already been implemented. We expect the $150 million cost savings in 2025 will primarily benefit the second half of the year, and we remain on track to achieve a full run rate of over $300 million of cost savings next year.\nWe are also reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.10 to $2.26. As you can see on Slide 18, we expect growth in the 3 remaining quarters of this year to be driven by adjusted EBITDA growth in renewables and utilities and monetization of tax attributes on new renewables projects, partially offset by higher interest and a higher adjusted tax rate.\nNow to our 2025 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $2.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion of parent free cash flow, which represents more than an 8% increase versus 2024. We also expect $700 million of planned parent debt issuance and closed the $450 million sell-down of a minority interest in our global insurance business earlier this week. Our captive global insurance business is a valuable asset within the AES portfolio that consistently produces attractive cash flow while managing property and business interruption risk within our operating portfolio. This structured transaction allows us to monetize a minority portion of this valuable business to support growth capital for renewables and utilities businesses. With this transaction, we have achieved our entire asset sale target for 2025.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the 2% dividend increase announced last December. We also plan to invest approximately $1.8 billion toward new growth and have already repaid roughly $400 million of subsidiary debt. With the sell-down of a minority interest in AES Ohio at the beginning of April, we now have CDPQ as a 30% partner in both of our U.S. utilities. This partnership is another example of how we use private capital to help fund growth and reduce parent investment requirements into our subsidiaries.\nFinally, turning to Slide 20. Our credit metrics are progressing in line with our expectations, benefiting from the actions we've taken since the beginning of this year. With the sell-down of our global insurance business, we have locked in our asset sales proceeds for the year. The sell-down of AES Ohio and subsequent debt paydown enabled S&P's recent 1- and 2-notch upgrades for DPO Inc. and AES Ohio, respectively. We have also refinanced this year's parent debt maturity and have already fully hedged the benchmark on all expected parent financing through 2027. Additionally, we implemented cost efficiencies and resized our development business to generate over $300 million in annual savings by next year. These actions provide us with a fully self-funded plan through 2027.\nIn summary, I am very pleased with our results this quarter, which were fully in line with the guidance we gave in February. We expect significant growth in the year to go that will come from projects that have already been brought online but which are still ramping to their full EBITDA, rate base investments that have already been made and cost reduction actions already implemented. I am confident we will achieve our guidance regardless of changes in the economic environment or changes in policy due to our focus on regulated utilities and long-term contracted generation, which has minimal volume interest rate for foreign currency exposure. I look forward to providing an update on our progress on our second quarter call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, our long-term contracted business model continues to demonstrate its resilience to tariffs, economic policies and business cycles. Our first quarter results are in line with our expectations, and we are reaffirming our 2025 guidance and long-term growth rate targets. Demand from our core corporate customers remains very strong, and we're seeing no slowdown in the energy needs of hyperscalers in any scenario.\nAs a result of our strategy to be a first mover in creating a domestic supply chain and working with existing suppliers to onshore imported equipment, the tariff exposure on our 11.7-gigawatt backlog is de minimis. Similarly, our construction program of 3.2 gigawatts this year is on track and well advanced. We have completed construction of 643 megawatts and we are 80% complete for the remaining 2.6 gigawatts, including 99% complete on the 1 gigawatt of our Bellefield project, which will be the largest solar plus storage project in the U.S. Our 2 utilities are among the fastest growing in the country, and we continue to make progress on attracting new data centers to our service territory.\nAnd lastly, we have already completed all of our major asset sales and financings for the year, solidifying our commitment to self-funding through our long-term guidance period. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 financial review call. We are very pleased with our financial performance so far this year. Today, I will discuss our results, the significant advancements we have made with large technology customers, and the work we are doing to incorporate generative AI in our portfolio to develop new competitive advantages.\nBeginning on Slide 3 with our second quarter results. We had a strong second quarter that was in line with our expectations. With adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $843 million, adjusted EBITDA of $652 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.38, we're on track to meet our 2024 financial objective, and we now expect to be in the top half of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes and adjusted EPS. We're also reaffirming our remaining 2024 guidance metrics and growth rates through 2027. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give more detail on our financial performance and outlook.\nI'm also pleased to report that since our last call in May, we have signed 2.5 gigawatts of new agreements in total, including 2.2 gigawatts with hyperscalers across our utilities and renewable businesses. This includes 1.2 gigawatts of new data center load growth across AES Ohio and AES Indiana, a PPA to provide 727 megawatts of new renewables in Texas, and a 310-megawatt retail supply agreement in Ohio. With these arrangements, we are expanding our work with the major data center providers to new areas of business.\nTurning now to data center growth at our U.S. utilities on Slide 4. Since our last call, we have signed agreements to support 1.2 gigawatts of new load across AES Ohio and AES Indiana expected to come online in phases beginning in 2026. Additionally, we're in advanced negotiations across several sites to support another 3 gigawatts of new load. These agreements are transformative for both utilities, with the potential to increase the peak load at both AES Ohio and AES Indiana by more than 50%. As a result, AES Ohio's rate base will consist predominantly of FERC-regulated transmission assets, receiving timely recovery through a formula rate.\nFor AES Indiana, this growth creates the potential for significant investment in transmission as well as additional build-out of new generation assets. These opportunities will even further increase our industry-leading U.S. utility rate base growth plans. Our service territories are particularly well positioned to serve data centers and other large loads with available interconnection, lower rates, and land prices, access to water resources and local incentives.\nTurning to Slide 5 and the generation build-out at AES Indiana. We continue to make progress in upgrading and transforming our generation fleet as we shut down or convert our coal units to gas and build our renewables fleet. I am pleased to announce that we have signed a deal to acquire a 170-megawatt solar-plus-storage development project that AES Indiana will construct and own. The project will require approximately $350 million of CapEx with an expected completion date in late 2027. Once approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, this will be the sixth project supporting AES Indiana's recent generation growth.\nNow turning to our renewables business on Slide 6. Since our last call in May, we have further expanded our partnership with Google, signing a 15-year PPA for 727 megawatts in Texas to power its data center growth. The agreement includes a combination of wind and solar to further Google's 24/7 carbon-free energy goals. These projects are expected to come online in 2026 and 2027. We also recently signed a retail supply agreement with Google for 310 megawatts to support their Ohio data centers. This agreement demonstrates the strong trust and collaboration between our companies, which began with our original 2021 partnership to provide 24/7 renewable power in Virginia. We see further opportunities to add renewables to support Google's data center growth in Ohio.\nTurning to Slide 7. With these major announcements today on our collaborations with hyperscalers, we have now signed a total of 8.1 gigawatts directly with technology companies, which is clearly a leading market position. As you can see on Slide 8, our backlog of projects under signed long-term contracts now stands at 12.6 gigawatts. Our focus remains on maximizing the quality of megawatts over the quantity, which means delivering high-quality projects with higher returns and long-duration PPAs. We have never felt better about our key customer relationships and the long-term market dynamics that are supporting growth and value creation in our portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 9. The demand for power that is coming from the rise in generative AI and data centers represents a significant structural change in the power sector, and no one is better positioned than AES for sustained growth from this opportunity. Regardless of election or policy outcomes, we are confident in our ability to continue signing renewable PPAs with mid-teen IRRs. Our corporate customers value our unique record of bringing projects online, on time over the past 5 years. Furthermore, looking at the interconnection queues, time to power, and price certainty, we see renewables as the only source of new power that can meet most of the demand over the next decade. AES has a long-standing and deep relationship with hyperscaler customers. This includes our ability to co-create new offerings and structure innovative clean energy solutions such as hybrid PPAs, shape products and 24/7 renewables.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, of the 3.6 gigawatts that we expect to bring online this year, we have already completed the construction of 1.6 gigawatts and expect the remainder to be weighted towards the third quarter. I should note that for the projects coming online this year, we have all of the major equipment already on site and almost all for 2025. Additionally, we expect a significant portion of our solar panels to be domestically produced beginning in 2026. All of the above, combined with having panels on site for 2025 projects, greatly mitigates our exposure to any potential new tariffs. Our diversified and resilient supply chain has been and will continue to be best-in-class.\nFinally, turning to Slide 11. Not only is generative AI shaping the customer landscape but it is also transforming how we work internally, providing new opportunities for efficiencies, customer service, and innovation that will give us new competitive advantages. As you may have seen, in June, we announced a partnership with AI Fund to accelerate AI-driven energy solutions. Founded by AI leader Andrew Ng, AI Fund is a venture studio that works with entrepreneurs to rapidly build companies. We are collaborating with AI Fund on co-building companies that leverage AI to address bottlenecks and improve efficiencies in the energy transition, in areas such as developing and operating renewables and asset management.\nAt the same time, we continue to leverage AI across our portfolio with our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. We are increasingly using proprietary tools across a wide range of our business operations, enabling our people to work faster and smarter. For example, our renewables team has built sophisticated tools that utilize generative AI to accurately predict the speed at which projects will move through interconnection queues, helping us more efficiently coordinate the various simultaneous development processes.\nAs you can see on Slide 12, earlier this week, we launched the world's first AI-powered solar installation robot, Maximo, which uses state-of-the-art AI and robotics to complement our construction crews in the installation of solar modules. Maximo enables faster construction times and reduces overall project costs. It can work 3 shifts even in the worst weather conditions with a more inclusive workforce. Not only does it reduce time to power, which is highly valued by our customers, but it will boost overall project returns. We plan to ramp up our use of Maximo in 2025 and are already utilizing it to construct a portion of our 2-gigawatt Bellefield project in California, which is the largest solar-plus-storage project in the U.S. and is contracted to serve Amazon.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $843 million in the second quarter versus $607 million a year ago. This was driven by growth in our renewables SBU, new rates and growth investments in our U.S. utilities, and higher margins in our energy infrastructure SBU.\nTurning to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.38 versus $0.21 last year. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but partially offset by higher depreciation and higher interest expense as a result of our growth. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or strategic business units on the next 4 slides.\nBeginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 16, higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by contributions from new projects but was partially offset by lower availability from a forced outage event at our 1-gigawatt Chivor hydro plant in Colombia. The outage was caused by record water inflows in early June, which brought significant sediment into the plant and damaged the units. Repairs to the plant were completed quickly and all units resumed operations by mid-July.\nHigher adjusted PTC at our utilities SBU was mostly driven by higher revenues from the $1.6 billion we've invested in our rate base in the past year. New rates implemented in Indiana in May, year-over-year low growth of 3.1%, as well as favorable weather. Higher EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run plant and higher margins in Chile, partially offset by lower margins in the Dominican Republic and the sell-down of our gas and LNG businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Finally, relatively flat EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects our continued development of early-stage technology businesses, partially offset by continued margin increases at Fluence.\nNow turning to our expectations on Slide 20. As a result of our strong first half performance and high confidence in a strong second half, I'm very happy to share that we now expect adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes to be in the top half of our 2024 expected range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. Drivers of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes in the year to go include higher contributions from new renewable commissionings, contributions from growth investments, and expected higher load at our U.S. utilities, partially offset by expected closings in our asset sale program.\nTurning to Slide 21, I am also very glad to share that we now expect our 2024 adjusted EPS to be in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.87 to $1.97. We increased our share of earnings in the first half of the year from 25% in 2023 to nearly half in 2024. Growth in the year to go will have similar drivers as adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes, partially offset by higher interest expense from growth capital.\nNow to our 2024 parent capital allocation on Slide 22. Sources reflect approximately $3 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.1 billion of parent free cash flow, $900 million to $1.1 billion of proceeds from asset sales, and $950 million of hybrid debt that we issued since our last earnings call in May. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion toward new growth, of which 85% will go to renewables and utilities.\nTurning to Slide 23. We are well on our way towards achieving our long-term asset sale target of $3.5 billion from 2023 through 2027. We've signed or closed more than $2.2 billion of asset sales since the beginning of last year, and we are now nearly 2/3 of the way to reaching our target even though we're only 1.5 years into our 5-year guidance period. We do not announce specific asset sales in advance, but the remaining proceeds could come from sell-downs of renewables projects, our intended coal exit, monetization of our New Energy Technologies businesses, and sales or sell-downs of other noncore assets.\nIn summary, we've made excellent progress this quarter toward all of our strategic and financial targets. We have clear line of sight toward achieving the key drivers of our year-to-go earnings growth, and we are well positioned to continue delivering on our financial goals beyond this year. We've also made significant headway on our long-term funding plan, which allows us to continue simplifying and focusing our portfolio while we scale our leading renewables and utilities businesses. Our strategy to serve high-value corporate customers, including a rapidly growing base of data center providers across our renewables and utilities businesses is highly resilient and will continue to yield financial success for AES and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to summarize the highlights from today's call. With more than 8 gigawatts of agreements already signed directly with large technology customers, including 2.2 gigawatts signed since our last call, we continue to be the industry leader in this segment. At the same time, we continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget with 1.6 gigawatts completed so far this year. We are fully on track to add a total of 3.6 gigawatts by the end of 2024.\nWe see demand for power from data centers in the U.S., growing around 22% a year, and we could not be better positioned to serve these customers from our renewable business to our utilities. I would like to reiterate that with strong demand for the projects in our 66-gigawatt development pipeline and our existing 12.6-gigawatt backlog of signed long-term PPAs, we are very confident in our ability to continue to meet or exceed our long-term objectives. Operator, please open up the line for questions."

My name is Jordan, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI'm now going to hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. And today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give more detail on our financial performance and outlook.\nBeginning on Slide 3 with our first quarter results. We had a strong first quarter that was in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $863 million, adjusted EBITDA of $635 million and adjusted EPS of $0.50. These results demonstrate once again our ability to execute on our plans and guidance and our structural resilience to high interest rates and inflation. I am pleased to reaffirm our 2024 guidance for all metrics and growth rates through 2027.\nToday, I will be discussing the success we have achieved with technology companies and data centers. as well as the significant market opportunity that we see for renewable growth for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 4. We I'm happy to announce that this quarter, we signed a 15-year contract with Amazon with a second phase of our [ Belfield ] project, with an additional 500 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of storage. The entire project including Belfield 1, which we contracted last year, will provide 2 gigawatts of combined solar and storage for Amazon, making it the biggest solar plus storage project in the U.S.\nWe see the 2 gigawatt Belfield solar plus storage project is a milestone for AES and a demonstration of the important role that renewables play in delivering new energy. The significant energy storage component which includes AES' proprietary AI weather forecasting ensures the project is able to supply carbon-free energy throughout the day.\nTurning to Slide 5. With this project, we now have nearly 6 gigawatts of long-term contracts directly with technology companies, making AES among the largest energy providers to data centers. This does not include more than 500 megawatts of contracts signed with utilities to serve data center customers. We are fully supporting the commitments that Google, Microsoft, Amazon and others have made to procure not just carbon-free energy, but specifically additional renewals.\nTurning to Slide 6. Across the U.S., power demand is forecasted to increase significantly over the next decade, driven by factors such as data center growth, onshoring of manufacturing and electrification of mobility. There is no technology better suited to serve this load growth than wind and solar, particularly when combined with energy storage.\nTurning to Slide 7. Even using data that is more than a year old, renewables clearly offer the lowest levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, of any new build on an unsubsidized basis. They provide a source of predictable energy that is not impacted by fuel availability or price volatility. Furthermore, renewables are substantially better placed than any other form of power to actually come online over the next decade when power shortages are likely to be most acute.\nNowhere is this clearer than in the interconnection queue, which is as you can see on Slide 8, are dominated by renewable projects. Looking at 2024 as an example, 95% of the capacity additions in the U.S. are expected to come from solar, energy storage and wind. A major part of this growth is coming from energy storage, whose installed capacity is expected to double by the end of the year.\nGiven our role in creating and first commercializing grid-scale lithium-ion-based energy storage. It fills me with great satisfaction to see that the 2 largest economies in the country, California and Texas now get more than 10% of their dispatchable capacity from batteries. We are now even seeing periods of the day in California when energy storage is the single largest source of power on the grid.\nTurning to Slide 9. Among renewable developers, AES is best positioned to address corporate load growth. We have the scale and experience to bring projects to market in the most cost-efficient way. Our flexibility and ability to innovate give us a competitive advantage with our large customers, just as it led to our early partnerships with data center companies. We also had the best track record in the market of supply chain management and bringing projects online, on time and on budget.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, we have a pipeline of 66 gigawatts, not including prospects, with projects ranging in maturity from early stage to late stage. Let me emphasize that all of the projects in our pipeline include some degree of land control as well as interconnection filing. In addition, rather than pursuing just total megawatts, we have taken a strategic approach to building our pipeline, focusing on those markets and sites where we see the most significant demand and where we are best positioned to add value.\nThe breadth and maturity of this pipeline, both in terms of market and interconnection positions provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage and line of sight into future growth. As I mentioned in February, our historical results, combined with accelerating demand for our renewable projects, led us to increase our U.S. project return expectations by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis and raised our long-term guidance for both EBITDA and EPS.\nWith 1.2 gigawatts of new contract signings since our Q4 call in February, including Belfield 2, we now have a backlog of signed contracts of 12.7 gigawatts. We have also added almost 600 megawatts of new projects to our operating portfolio, including the completion of [ Chevron Butte ], which is the largest wind project in the state of Arizona and Delta which is the first utility-scale wind project in the state of Mississippi.\nWith these additions to our operating fleet and the good progress we are making on our projects currently under construction, we remain fully on track to add a total of 3.6 gigawatts of new capacity this year. I should note that for the remaining projects coming online in 2024, we had 92% of the major equipment already on site, including virtually all of our solar modules and more than half of our solar modules for 2025. Our diversified and resilient supply chain has been and will continue to be one of our differentiators.\nTurning to our utilities on Slide 11. In mid-April, AES Indiana achieved a critical milestone with the approval of its rate case by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Resolving the rate case provides us a constructive regulatory foundation for our investments focused on reliability, resiliency and customer experience. and allows us to partially recover accumulated inflation since our last rate case in 2017. The $71 million rate case increase includes an ROE of 9.9% and demonstrating the commission support for investments that strengthen the overall system reliability and drive value for customers.\nIn late February, we also closed on the acquisition of the 106-megawatt Hoosier Wind project, providing long-term savings to our customers while also adding to AS Indiana's portfolio of renewable projects. AES Indiana's latest Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, includes a commitment for the addition of 1,300 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage over the next 5 years.\nAt AES Ohio, we continue to execute on our growth plan. Stemming from our new rate case structure, ESP 4, put in place in Q3 of last year. as well as our Smart Grid program and FERC formula investment in transmission. By the end of the program, AES Ohio will still maintain the lowest rates in the state across all customer classes. As a reminder, approximately 80% of AES Ohio's planned investments through 2027 are already approved or under FERC formula rate programs.\nAcross our 2 utilities, our Q1 investment was up nearly 100% from last year as a result of the new rate structures and investing to improve system resilience and customer experience. Looking ahead, we now have a clear line of sight to $4 billion of our total utility capital program of $5.3 billion through 2027.\nWe are also seeing the potential for further upside from the growing interest from data center providers who see our service territory as a desirable location for growth. With double-digit rate base growth throughout our planned horizon, we believe they represent one of the fastest-growing utility investment opportunities in the country.\nWith that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Following that, I will provide a deeper dive into our low-risk, highly efficient capital struggle to understand.\nTurning to Slide 13. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $863 million in the first quarter versus $641 million a year ago. This was driven primarily by contributions from the roughly 600 megawatts of new renewables we brought online.\nTurning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 versus $0.22 last year and in line with our expectations. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but also included higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. These results include approximately $0.08 of tax benefits, consistent with our expectations which were associated with steps we took this quarter to transition to a more U.S.-oriented holding company structure that is better aligned with our significant U.S. growth.\nIn the future, we may recognize further benefits from our revised simpler structure, although likely of a smaller magnitude. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 23% to 25% for the full year excluding the impact of tax credit transfers, which we are showing at the SBU level for simplicity. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or strategic business units on the next 4 slides.\nBeginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 15. Higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses, but was partially offset by lower renewable resource in Panama and Brazil. Higher adjusted PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by favorable weather in the U.S. as well as higher revenues from investments in our rate base. This was partially offset by interest expense on new borrowings to fund future growth.\nRelatively flat EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU, primarily reflects prior year higher LNG transaction margins and the sell-down of our gas and LNG businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic. This was partially offset by higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run plant. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects continued margin improvement at Fluence.\nNow turning to our guidance on Slide 19. We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion and 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect to continue to see strong growth in our renewables and utilities businesses, partially offset by short-term dilution and from continued execution on our $3.5 billion asset sale target through 2027.\nWe are also reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.87 to $1.97. Our earnings will have similar drivers to adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes, but will also be impacted by a lower adjusted tax rate and higher parent interest. We anticipate a more even distribution of cash and earnings throughout the year, with nearly half of earnings expected to come in the first half versus only 25% in 2023.\nNow to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 20. Sources reflect approximately $3 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.1 billion of current free cash flow, $900 million to $1.1 billion of proceeds from asset sales and $900 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance. As a reminder, we limit any parent debt issuance to a level consistent with our investment-grade credit metrics. We continue to be very pleased with the great progress toward our $3.5 billion asset sale program which will limit and may eliminate any need for future parent equity issuance throughout our long-term guidance period.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion towards new growth of which 85% will go to renewables and utilities. One of our strengths is the flexibility we maintain in our capital plan across both sources and uses. As we have for many years, we will continue to execute on opportunities to rotate capital across the portfolio in a manner that creates shareholder value.\nNext, I want to take a moment to discuss how we manage our balance sheet on Slide 21. First, we utilize nonrecourse debt to fund our growth. Approximately 82% of the debt on our balance sheet is nonrecourse to AES Corp., meaning it is only secured at the relevant this important structural component limits our risk at the parent company to the equity we invest in our subsidiaries. We further insulate our financials from interest rate movements with nearly 90% of our long-term debt being fixed rate or hedged.\nIn addition, nearly $4 billion of the debt on our balance sheet is under designated construction facilities, which are also nonrecourse to the parent company, but are backed by projects that don't yet generate earnings or cash. When a project reaches commercial operations, approximately half of this construction debt will be repaid with cash generated from the monetization of tax attributes leading to a significantly lower long-term leverage profile on projects in operation. As a result, recourse debt to the ADS parent is only 18% of total leverage.\nUsing an example of a typical U.S. solar plus battery project on Slide 22. We've centered our strategy around a capital-efficient model, which quickly recycles cash enabling the rapid growth we've achieved in recent years. First, when we place a project in service, we pay down at least 40% of a project's capital cost with tax equity partnerships and tax credit transfers. Our projects typically benefit from the investment tax credit, which provides an attractive upfront cash return on our investment and significantly reduces net parent cash requirements.\nWe fund an additional approximately 40% using fixed rate amortizing nonrecourse debt, which is investment-grade rated. In order to insulate project returns from changes in interest rates, we pre-hedged this expected debt issuance when we sign a PPA. We currently have nearly $9 billion of outstanding interest rate hedges on our balance sheet, most of which relate to our U.S. renewables business.\nWith respect to equity requirements for U.S. renewables, our development partner, Alberta Investment Management or AIMCo, contributes 25% of equity capital needs. Once a project is completed, we typically bundle it into an operating portfolio and sell down a large minority stake at an attractive premium and recover most, if not all, of the upfront parent equity investment in the project.\nThe end result is a material ownership in a high-quality, long-term renewables project listed and de minimis risk to our balance sheet. This model allows us to grow rapidly while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and ensures our financial results are not sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nNow turning back to our first quarter results. We've had a tremendous start to the year, making significant progress towards all of our financial targets. We expect to continue as we complete our remaining 3 gigawatts of new projects and continue growing the rate base at our U.S. utilities while maintaining a low-risk, highly efficient capital structure and funding plan.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Before we open up the call for questions, I would like to sum up the highlights of the quarter. We had a strong first quarter in line with our expectations. Our earnings and cash flow are now more evenly balanced throughout the year as our U.S. renewable business matures. Our performance demonstrates yet again our ability to execute and that our financial results are not sensitive to higher interest rates.\nOur financial model is proving very resilient as we see ample supply of nonrecourse project finance debt as well as strong demand for tax attributes and project equity from minority partners. In addition, our asset sales program is on track, representing an important component of our capital-efficient growth model. which may even eliminate our need for issuing corporate equity through our long-term guidance period.\nOur stock would have to reach much higher valuation before new parent equity would even be considered several years in the future. We see strong and accelerating demand for renewables in our core markets and are pleased to be in a leading position with the largest segment of growth data centers. We're also executing well on our construction program and have virtually all of the major equipment we need for 2024 on site and the majority of what we need for 2025 as well.\nOur supply chain management continues to support our best-in-class track record of delivering new renewable projects on time and on budget. In closing, we are once again delivering on our strategic objectives and financial guidance and are uniquely well placed to be one of the winners of the energy transition.\nOperator, please open up the line for questions."

My name is Elliot, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q, filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2023 strategic and financial performance. Stephen Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly.\nBeginning on Slide 3. 2023 was our best year ever, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives, including signing a record of 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs, putting us well on track to achieve 14 to 17 gigawatts of new signings through 2025, completing 3.5 gigawatts of construction, exceeding the target we laid out and doubling our additions compared to 2022, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion in the top end of our guidance range and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.4 billion, achieving adjusted EPS of $1.76 and parent free cash flow of just over $1 billion, both beyond the top end of our guidance ranges, and realizing asset sales proceeds of $1.1 billion, significantly above our target of $400 million to $600 million.\nTurning to Slide 4. Despite the backdrop of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges across the sector, we demonstrated that our business model is strong, resilient and well positioned. Demand across the sector has never been stronger. And in this context, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our expected annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow at an annual rate of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS to grow at 7% to 9%, both through 2027. We are also reaffirming all of our other existing guidance. I can definitely say that I have never felt better about the outlook for this business.\nTurning to power purchase agreement signings on Slide 5. We signed 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs in 2023, more than any other year in our company's 43-year history, putting us well on track to sign 14 to 17 gigawatts of new renewable contracts from 2023 through 2025.\nToday, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs is 12.3 gigawatts, the vast majority of which will be commissioned over the next 3 years. It is worthwhile to note that all of the projects in our contracted backlog remain on track for timely completion, consistent with our historical performance.\nMoving to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight that the largest segment of our new business is with corporate customers. In fact, in 2023, nearly 60% of the 3.5 gigawatts of projects we brought online were to serve corporate customers and large technology companies, in particular.\nBloomberg New Energy Finance has consistently named AES as 1 of the top 2 providers of renewable energy to corporations worldwide, and our business continues to expand, particularly, given our focus on serving the power needs from data centers, which are powering the rapid growth of AI.\nWe are well positioned to serve this customer segment for a number of reasons. First, we have been on the forefront of working directly with these technology companies to provide innovative solutions to achieve specific renewable energy profile. Back in 2021, we were the first company to introduce hourly match renewable energy. And today, we are working with all of the hyperscale data center companies to provide solutions that are tailored for their renewable energy and sustainability goals.\nSecond, we have a strong track record of delivering our projects on time, on budget, while meeting the unique needs of our customers, which I will cover in more detail momentarily. Our record of reliability is something that is increasingly recognized and valued by our customers.\nAnd third, we have the scale and the pipeline to address growing demand from data centers, which is estimated to more than double by 2030. With over 50 gigawatts of projects in our development pipeline and advanced interconnection positions in the most relevant markets in the U.S., we are particularly well positioned to meet the energy demand of technology customers.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our success with corporate customers combined with our improved efficiency in development and construction, have increased the returns that we have seen across our renewable portfolio. As a result, we're upping our U.S. return ranges by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis. We are seeing even higher returns internationally. With strong market demand in AES' leading position, we are able to be increasingly selective about the projects we built, with a focus on those with the best overall financial benefits.\nNext, turning to construction on Slide 8. Our ability to complete projects on time and on budget has become a major differentiator for AES. Not only is this something that our customers highly value, but it is also a pillar of our business model, and ensures that our realized financial returns are on average, equal to or better than our projections.\nAt the time of PPA signing, we lock in contractual arrangements for all major equipment, EPC and long-term financing, which we hedge to ensure no interest rate exposure. At the same time, we systematically embed flexibility in our supply chain to safeguard against a variety of scenarios. We also have a multiyear strategic arrangement with top suppliers, including Fluence, who we see as having the most competitive product in the industry. More than half of our solar projects in recent years have co-located storage components, and our relationship with Fluence helped us to have the best on-time project completion rate in the industry.\nIn 2024, we feel very confident in our ability to add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.2 gigawatts in the U.S. We currently have 100% of the major equipment for these projects contractually secured and nearly 80% already on site.\nNow turning to our utilities, beginning on Slide 9. In 2023, we achieved important milestones at our U.S. utilities that will drive future growth, continued decarbonization and improvement in customer service. At AES, Ohio, we put in place a new regulatory framework. And at AES Indiana, we reached a unanimous settlement for our first rate case since 2018. As a result, investments are on track for the rate base growth in the high teens at both utilities, and we now have close to 70% of our planned investments through 2027 already approved in regulatory orders.\nTurning to Slide 10. At AES, Ohio, we are embarking on the largest investment program that this utility has ever seen, which includes the expansion and enhancement in our transmission assets. With over 25% rate base growth per year, this is one of the fastest transmission growth rates in the country. We also recently filed for regulatory approval of the second phase of our smart grid plant, which upgrades our grid to improve service quality and customer experience.\nTurning to Slide 11. At AES, Indiana, we continue to invest to improve service quality and greener generation mix. I am happy to say that we now have regulatory approval for the build-out of all named renewable projects at AES Indiana, encompassing 106 megawatts of wind, 445 megawatts of solar and 245 megawatts of energy storage.\nAs we continue to invest in our customer experience, service quality and sustainability at both of our U.S. utilities, 2 core principles have guided our growth plans. First is customer affordability as we address much needed investments. We currently have the lowest residential rates in both states, which we expect to maintain throughout this period of growth. And second is to prioritize the timely recovery of our investments through existing mechanisms and programs. Across both utilities, we now anticipate approximately 75% of the growth capital to be deployed under such mechanisms, which substantially reduces regulatory lag.\nFinally, turning to Slide 12. Last year, we set an asset sale proceeds target of $400 million to $600 million. We greatly exceeded this range, with $1.1 billion of gross proceeds. These transactions not only put a high valuation marker on our businesses, but also put us well on our way towards achieving our asset sales goal of $2 billion through 2025 and $3.5 billion through 2027.\nOur success this past year provides us with a cushion, and we expect 2024 to be another strong year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2023 results and capital allocation, our 2024 guidance and our updated expectations through 2027.\nAs Andres mentioned, 2023 was AES' best year on record, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial targets. We beat our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent free cash flow guidance range of $950 million to $1 billion. We also recorded strong adjusted EBITDA, well above the midpoint of our inaugural guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion.\nTurning to Slide 14. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $3.4 billion versus $3.2 billion in 2022, driven primarily by contributions from new renewables projects as well as the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio, included as part of the [ ESP 4 ] settlement. These drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from the energy infrastructure SBU.\nTurning to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 in 2023 versus $1.67 in 2022. Drivers were similar to those for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes. In addition, there was a $0.06 headwind from parent interest on higher debt balances, primarily used to fund new renewables projects.\nI'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the renewable strategic business unit, or SBU, on Slide 16.\nHigher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes at our Renewables SBU was primarily driven by contributions from the 3.5 gigawatts of new projects that came online in 2023 as well as higher margins in Colombia, but partially offset by the sell-down of select U.S. renewable operating assets.\nAt our Utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was primarily driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP 4 settlement as well as rate base growth in the U.S.\nLower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU reflects significant LNG transaction margins in 2022, lower margins in Chile and the sale of a minority interest in our Southland combined-cycle assets. These drivers were partially offset by the higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant.\nFinally, at our New Energy Technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects improved results at Fluence, which achieved positive adjusted EBITDA in their fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Fluence also guided to positive adjusted EBITDA for their full fiscal year 2024.\nNow let's turn to how we allocated our capital last year on Slide 20. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of just over $1 billion, which increased nearly 11% from the prior year, to just above the top end of our guidance. We also significantly surpassed our asset sales target, with $750 million in net asset sales proceeds to the AES parent after subsidiary-level debt repayment, reinvestment and taxes. And we issued $900 million of parent debt in May of last year.\nMoving to uses on the right-hand side. We invested more than $2.1 billion in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately 2/3 was in the U.S. We also allocated more than $500 million of discretionary cash to our dividend.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance throughout 2023.\nNow let's turn to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 21. Today, we're initiating 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, driven by over $500 million in contributions from new renewables projects and from rate base growth at our U.S. utilities. We have also incorporated a $200 million partially offsetting impact from asset sales we either closed in 2023 or planned to close this year.\nExcluding the $1 billion in tax attributes, we expect to recognize in 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. The increase in tax attributes versus the prior year is partially due to our continued use of tax credit transfers, which results in earlier recognition of tax credits than typical tax equity structures. In addition, last year's increase in new project completions will drive higher tax attribute recognition in 2024. As a reminder, we will recognize approximately 1/3 of tax attributes generated on 2023 projects in the 2024 fiscal year.\nLooking beyond this year, our head start on asset sales gives us greater visibility toward our longer-term growth and puts downward pressure on our capital budget. We expect EBITDA to increase each year through the remainder of our long-term guidance period.\nTurning to Slide 22. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.87 to $1.97, which represents a 9% increase year-over-year and puts us on track to achieve our 7% to 9% long-term growth target through 2025. Growth will be primarily driven by our renewables and utilities businesses and will be partially offset by higher parent interest. We also expect an $0.08 headwind from asset sales.\nOur construction program this year is more evenly spread than in recent years. As a result, we expect approximately 40% of our earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half, and we will have greater visibility throughout the year into our expected construction completion.\nTurning to Slide 23. As Andres mentioned, our very strong market position in providing tailored solutions to corporate clients, including large data centers, has allowed us to realize higher returns on our renewables projects. In addition, as our renewals business continues to scale, we anticipate further realization of productivity and scale benefits.\nBased on these factors and our 2023 results, we now expect AES' U.S. renewables returns to be in the 12% to 15% range. These higher returns in the U.S., along with productivity benefits, are directly accretive to our earnings and cash flow. And as a result, we are increasing our expected long-term adjusted EBITDA growth rate to 5% to 7% and our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to 7% to 9% through 2027, off a base of our 2023 guidance midpoint.\nNow turning to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24, beginning with approximately $3.1 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2024 is expected to be around $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We expect to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion of net asset sale proceeds this year. By the end of this year, we expect to be more than halfway toward the $3.5 billion gross asset sales target we announced on our third quarter earnings call.\nAlthough we expect an increase of approximately $1 billion of parent debt this year, our business is well insulated from changes in interest rates. Our new projects are funded primarily with fixed rate or long-term hedged, self-amortizing debt, with tenors similar to the length of our PPAs, and more than 80% of our outstanding debt is nonrecourse to AES Corp. Our exposure from floating rates and future issuances is managed with nearly $8 billion in outstanding hedges.\nLooking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in rates on our future issuances, refinancings and outstanding U.S. floating rate debt, we have only $0.01 of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024.\nNow to the uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion in new growth, of which about 85% will be allocated to growing our renewables portfolio and utility rate base. More than 90% of this will be directed into the U.S., with the remainder going to growth projects, Chile and Panama. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 4% increase.\nTurning to Slide 25. Our long-term sources of parent capital through 2027 reflect the accelerated asset sales target we introduced on our third quarter call. We also expect higher organic cash generation as a result of our increased long-term growth rates. As a reminder, we will not issue any new equity until 2026 at the earliest, and will only do so in a way that creates value on a per share basis.\nNow to Slide 26. Uses through 2027 reflect more than $7 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, primarily to grow our renewables and utilities businesses. We also expect to allocate more than $2 billion to our dividend.\nGiven our surplus of attractive investment opportunities and our desire to minimize equity issuance as a source of capital, we now expect to grow our dividend at 2% to 3% annually beyond 2024. We believe this provides an optimal balance between an already attractive dividend yield and strong earnings and cash flow growth throughout our plan period.\nIn summary, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AES. We demonstrated our ability to adapt to the current market and execute on our growth commitments, while we further advanced our competitive position. As we continue to perfect and scale our renewables machine, we expect to have another record year in 2024 and to deliver on our now higher long-term growth target.\nWe have positioned AES to achieve our strategic priorities and grow our business in a way that's highly value accretive to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, 2023 was our best year ever, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives across our guidance metrics, PPA signings, construction completions and asset sales.\nWe are seeing strong demand for renewables across the sector, particularly due to the unprecedented demand from data centers. As a result, we are not only upping our U.S. project return rates, but increasing our expected average annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share through 2027.\nFinally, our significant success with asset sales to date as well as the outlook for the near future, gives us great comfort in our long-term funding plan. With that, I would like to open the call for questions."

My name is Kate, and I will be the moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 financial review call. In addition to discussing our third quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year, I will address some concerns that we have heard from investors since our second quarter call in August. Specifically, my remarks today will focus on 3 areas: strategic and financial updates, our funding sources and our exposure to interest rates.\nBeginning on Slide 3. I am pleased to report that our financial results continue to be strong and we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the top half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. We are also reaffirming all of our short- and long-term financial metrics. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.60. I'm very pleased with these results, which Steve will address in more detail shortly.\nTurning to Slide 4. We continue to see strong demand for long-term contracts for renewables, particularly from our primary customer base of large technology companies with a rapidly expanding data center business. Notably, even with rising interest rates, renewables continue to have the lowest levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, across almost all of the markets where we operate. So far this year, we have signed 3.7 gigawatts of new PPAs, including 1.5 gigawatts since our second quarter call in August. This number does not include the 1.2 gigawatts of new projects we were recently awarded in New York. Given that we have several large contracts that could be finalized in the coming weeks, we remain confident in our ability to sign at least 5 gigawatts of new long-term PPAs this year.\nIncluded in the new contracts that we have already signed, is our first ever developed transfer agreement, or DTA, to transfer to a utility, 975 megawatts of solar plus storage at the point of commencement of construction. This structure allows us to create value from our advanced pipeline without the investment of any AES equity beyond the development costs.\nNow turning to our backlog on Slide 5. Our backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts is now 13.1 gigawatts. Of this total backlog, we expect more than 70% or over 9 gigawatts to come online through 2025. And and we have already secured all of the necessary equipment for these projects. Furthermore, 44% or 5.8 gigawatts is already under construction.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our construction program continues to make excellent progress with 93% of the megawatts expected to come online this year, already having achieved mechanical completion. As a result, we have increased our year-end construction target from 3.4 gigawatts to 3.5 gigawatts to incorporate the progress we have made this year. This figure reflects a more than doubling of the renewable projects placed in service compared to last year.\nNow turning to Slide 7. In light of current market conditions, I would like to directly address the sources of funding that we have in our long-term plan. We will not be issuing any equity until at least 2026, and even then, we will only issue equity if it is value accretive to our shareholders. Instead, we are significantly accelerating our asset sales and believe we now have line of sight to at least $2 billion of asset sale proceeds in '24 and '25 and expect our asset sale proceeds to total at least $3.5 billion through 2027. With the proceeds from the sell-downs of our businesses in the Dominican Republic and Panama that we announced in September, we have already secured all of our external financing needs for the year at attractive terms.\nThe general buckets that are part of our asset sales plan are: coal exit, sell-downs of U.S. renewable projects, partial monetization of businesses, including new energy technologies and the exit of certain noncore businesses. We also plan to bring in partners at some of our businesses as we have done in the past to reduce future equity needs. While we never disclose specific transactions until we have actually signed sales agreement, we are in active and positive discussions with many interested counterparties. Turning to Slide 8. The last topic I want to address before turning the call over to Steve is our exposure to interest rates. As a normal course of business, we have always proactively matched the profile of the debt to the profile of the cash flows that are supporting. which minimizes any impact from higher interest rates. Approximately 80% of our debt is nonrecourse to the AES parent. And of that, the vast majority is either utility debt included in our customer rates or project level debt that is matched to the underlying project revenues. All of our long-term debt at Corp is either fixed or hedged and as we have stated before, we've been able to pass on higher costs and interest rates in the new PPAs we signed.\nFinally, I want to highlight our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, which we see as an important component of our value proposition. To that end, in every business decision we make, we take into consideration our relevant credit metrics. We take a disciplined approach to growth and overall risk management to ensure that we consistently maintain these metrics. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our 2023 guidance, how we are flexing our plans to adapt to current financial market conditions and how we minimize our exposure to interest rates. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 10. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong third quarter and are fully on track to achieve our full year guidance. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was just over $1 billion versus $991 million last year, driven primarily by higher contributions at our renewables SBU, the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AS Ohio included as part of the ESP IV settlement and improved results at Fluence. .\nThese drivers were partially offset by the absence of the significant LNG transaction margins, which we earned last year. Tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables projects this quarter were $18 million versus $60 million a year ago. In line with our expectations of a higher share of renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 11. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 versus $0.63 last year. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we saw higher parent interest expense this quarter as well as a higher adjusted tax rate. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next few slides, beginning on Slide 12. In the renewables SBU, we saw higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes driven primarily by higher contributions from new projects brought online in the last 12 months as well as higher margins in Colombia. This was partially offset by lower tax credit recognition as a result of fewer new projects placed into service this quarter versus a year ago.\nOur business continues to make strong progress, not just with construction, but also the financing of new projects. We continue to see a robust market for tax credits. This year, we have already raised $1.8 billion in tax capital financing. The market for tax attributes is also greatly expanding as a result of the tax credit transfer option that has brought many more participants to the market. Importantly, tax credit transfers get recognized in operating and free cash flow, which further enhances our financial funding flexibility. Going forward, we will increasingly use tax credit transfers as a means to monetize tax credits including for nearly 500 megawatts of projects in 2023.\nAt our Utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP IV settlement, which have been recognized as an expense in the third quarter of last year. I'd now like to take a moment to discuss the continued progress of our utility growth program on Slide 14.\nIn August, we received commission approval at AES Ohio for our new Electric Security Plan, or ESP 4, which includes timely recovery of $500 million of grid modernization investments at a 10% return on equity, allowing us to further improve the quality of service. As a reminder, we plan to grow the combined rate bases of our U.S. utilities at a 10% average annual rate through 2027. 80% of our planned investments through 2027 are either already approved or under FERC formula rate programs. We are executing on this plan and with our investment programs across the 2 utilities, we are on track to increase our capital expenditures by over 35% year-over-year as we work to modernize and invest in system reliability.\nAs we previously discussed, our utilities in Ohio and Indiana continue to charge the lowest residential rates of all electric utilities in both states. Turning back to our third quarter results, with our energy infrastructure SBU on Slide 15. Lower adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects significant LNG transaction margins in the prior year, partially offset by prior year onetime expenses in Argentina and higher revenues recognized from the monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant.\nFinally, at our new Energy Technologies SBU higher adjusted EBITDA reflects continued improved results at Fluence. Fluence has continued to demonstrate improving margins and strong pipeline growth, and they have indicated their expectation to be close to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the fourth quarter of their 2023 fiscal year. This year-over-year improvement would be reflected in our own fourth quarter results.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'm very pleased to highlight that we now expect to achieve the top half of both our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent free cash flow range of $950 million to $1 billion. This reflects the strong performance of our renewables construction team whose excellent execution this year means that we expect to exceed our construction target of 3.4 gigawatts by at least 100 megawatts.\nNow to Slide 18. We are reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, including the $500 million to $560 million of tax attributes we expect to realize in 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion. The additional U.S. projects we expect to bring online this year should allow us to exceed the midpoint of the tax attributes estimate we provided at Investor Day.\nNow to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $2.4 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of asset sales and the $900 million parent debt issuance we completed in Q2. With the agreement to sell down a minority interest in our gas and LNG business in the Dominican Republic and Panama, we have secured the entirety of our external sources of parent level capital for 2023.\nTurning to Slide 20. Since our Investor Day in May, financial market conditions have changed, and AES will flex its near-term and long-term plans accordingly. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize our strong credit profile and investment grade ratings hitting our financial metric growth targets, funding our growth primarily in U.S. renewables and U.S. utilities and advancing on our decarbonization and portfolio simplification goals. We have a number of levers to adjust that will keep us on track with these objectives.\nFirst, and to be clear, we will not issue equity at or near current share price levels and not until it is value accretive to our shareholders on a per share basis. As such, we are increasing our asset sale target to at least $3.5 billion for the 2023 to 2027 time frame and accelerating our plan to achieve $2 billion of asset sale proceeds in 2024 and 2025. With this change, we will not issue any equity until at least 2026, and the amount anticipated has been reduced to $500 million to $1 billion through our guidance period.\nSecond, the tax credit transferability option that we now have creates added flexibility to monetize the tax value of our U.S. renewables projects with a broader base of market participants while also increasing free cash flow and the capacity to fund growth. Third, while we still intend to exit all of our coal businesses in a few of our markets, our coal assets will be temporarily needed to support the energy transition beyond 2025 as renewable deployments and transmission have not progressed as quickly as required. We still intend to exit the majority of our remaining coal businesses by the end of 2025. However, we have the flexibility to delay the exit of a few select plants through 2027 to support continued electricity reliability. This delay would yield continued financial contributions from these assets during this period.\nFor 2024 and 2025, we expect to fund our remaining parent capital needs entirely with asset sales and planned debt issuances. We feel confident that we can achieve the $2 billion asset sale target in these years as we have already held discussions for a large portion of the assets in this program. We anticipate competitive processes that will yield attractive valuations with minimal dilution to earnings and cash beyond what had been incorporated in our plan. Our sales program is designed to meet our strategic objectives to simplify and decarbonize our portfolio while funding our core growth investments in U.S. renewables and utilities.\nFinally, turning to Slide 21, we are largely hedged against future increases in interest rates. Looking at the parent company, our long-term debt is entirely fixed and we hedge our exposure to refinancing risk over a 5-year window. Our nearest maturities in 2025 and 2026 were previously hedged at a rate of approximately 3%. Approximately 80% of our consolidated debt is at the subsidiary or project level and is nonrecourse to the parent. We typically prehedge future project debt issuance for the full tenor when we sign a PPA insulating our expected returns from future rate movements.\nThe amortizing structure of our project debt rather than bullet maturities allow the project to support higher leverage. As we grow, our long-term debt balances will increase proportionally to the underlying cash flow of our businesses, enabling us to maintain steady leverage ratios and investment-grade credit metrics. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $6 billion of interest rate hedges outstanding at an average rate of 2.9%. Looking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in interest rates on our future issuances, refinancings and U.S. floating rate debt, we have under $0.01 of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024 and and $0.03 to $0.04 of exposure in 2025.\nUnhedged floating rate debt is primarily located outside the U.S. where inflation indexation in our PPAs provides a natural hedge against rising rates. In summary, as we approach year-end, we've made excellent progress on achieving our financial and strategic objectives for 2023. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are flexing to adapt to current financial market conditions. With line of sight to our future growth funding needs, we will create value from our excellent market position while continuing to prioritize maintaining investment-grade credit metrics and achieving our financial commitments. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to briefly address A few other concerns that we have heard from some of you regarding the future of the renewable sector in general. For starters, global warming is, unfortunately, very real and likely accelerating. We have seen it in all-time record temperatures over the past 5 years and especially this summer in the Northern Hemisphere. This new reality was reflected in record demand for energy during heat waves, unprecedented wildfires and more volatile rainfall, all of which affect the general public. .\nCompletely apolitical actors, such as insurance companies are pulling out of certain markets in vulnerable areas after suffering material losses due to climate change. It is, therefore, extremely unlikely that major corporations will abruptly walk away from all of their carbon reduction goals regardless of any short-term unscientific political rhetoric. Given all that is happening in the renewable space, it is now more important than ever to differentiate among companies and developers. In my opinion, nobody is better placed than AES to create shareholder value from the ongoing energy transition because we have been focusing for years on the most resilient and lucrative opportunities. We are among the largest suppliers of renewable energy in the most attractive markets in the U.S., California, New York and PJM.\nWe are also the biggest supplier of renewable energy to corporations in the world and particularly to data centers. Already, data centers represent half of our U.S. backlog and the growth of generative AI will only accelerate their demand for more renewable energy. An important differentiator is that AES is one of the very few major renewable developers that has not had to abandon projects in its backlog due to cost increases or supply chain disruptions. This has cemented our reputation for reliability among premium customers. And finally, AES is the most innovative company in the sector, developing and implementing new technologies such as grid scale energy storage, hourly match renewable power purchase agreements, refabricated solar, construction robotics and software for energy efficiency in AI-enabled grid visualization. I believe these efforts will have material and growing benefit to our shareholders, especially by maintaining our lead in the most lucrative market segments. Regarding significant drivers for future growth post 2027, AES is best positioned to be the leader in green hydrogen production with the most advanced large project in the country, in Texas, in our participation in 2 of the largest hubs chosen by the Department of Energy.\nOur green hydrogen projects have real offtakers and sites, and we expect that they will meet the most exacting standards of additionality, regionality and hourly matching. Today, AES has the technology, the people, customer and supplier relationships, the scale and proven track record to continue to grow renewables profitably during the now unstoppable energy transition. While the total addressable market for our products and services is truly immense. I want to emphasize once more that our aim is to maximize shareholder value, not the number of megawatts or market share. Our priority will always be to ensure the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders on a per share basis. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

My name is Ellen, and I will be coordinating the call for today. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead whenever you are ready.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndres Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results as well as the excellent progress we're making towards our financial and strategic objectives. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook.\nFor the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Results for the quarter as well as for the first half of the year are very much in line with our expectations. Thus, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rate through 2027. As we noted earlier this year, approximately 75% of our 2023 earnings will come in the second half of the year.\nNow for an update on our strategic priorities. At the core of our strategy is a focus on, first, new renewables with the target to triple our installed capacity by 2027. Second, growth at our U.S. utilities, where we expect to increase the rate base by more than 10% per year through 2027. And third, the transformation of our portfolio as we exit coal by the end of 2025 and invest in the new technologies that will define our industry for years to come.\nToday, I will provide an update on how we are executing across each of these focus areas, beginning with our renewables on Slide 4. We continue to see significant inbound interest from key customers wanting to do large U.S.-based renewable projects with us. We believe this reflects both our reputation for consistently delivering on time as well as our best-in-class ability to tailor projects to the specific needs of our customers. Year-to-date, we have now signed 2.2 gigawatts of new PPAs, including 2.1 gigawatts since our Investor Day in May. These numbers do not include 1 gigawatt from Belfield second phase or 1.4 gigawatts from our green hydrogen project with Air AES Products in Texas, both of which could be signed before the year's end. I feel good about the likelihood that we will sign 5 to 6 gigawatts of new PPAs this year. We continue to be globally the #1 seller of renewable energy to corporate customers. We also had a leading position in the U.S., providing renewable energy to data centers, which are seeing explosive growth in part as a result of the generative AI revolution.\nTurning to Slide 5. Another area of recent success is how we have been working with technology customers to complete projects initiated by other developers. Our corporate customers want us to take on these projects because they know we will deliver them on time and can also restructure the original PPAs to provide customized solutions. Two great recent examples of this are the 185-megawatt Delta Wind project in Mississippi which has a signed PPA with Amazon and the 2 gigawatt Belfield project in California, 1 gigawatt, of which has a signed PPA with a large technology company that is a repeat customers. Both of these projects demonstrate the strength of the relationships we have with our customers.\nFor us, completing other developers' projects is especially attractive because we can get similar returns to greenfield projects while preserving our current pipeline for future projects. Our 61 gigawatt pipeline represents investments in land, interconnection and development which must be replaced once utilized, given growing constraints on new transmission in markets like California and PJM, having the flexibility to decide when to utilize these resources helps us maximize total returns from our renewables business.\nMoving on to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts of 13.2 gigawatts, which is the largest in AES' history. I would like to reiterate once more that our definition of backlog includes only signed contracts for which we have an obligation to deliver and our customers have an obligation to take a given amount of renewable energy for a given amount of time. The average tenure of the contracts in our backlog is 19 years, and currently, 41% of our 13.2 backlog is already under construction, and 74% is slated to come online within the next 3 years.\nTurning to Slide 7. Since our Investor Day in May, we have completed a number of landmark projects. In June, we announced the commercial operation of the 238-megawatt Phase 1 of the Chevelon Butte wind project in Arizona. It is one of the first projects in the country to be placed in service to qualify for the 10% additional energy community tax credit bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. And once Phase 2 is completed, it will reach 454 megawatts and be the largest wind project in the state. In addition, we completed the Andes 2B solar-plus storage project in Chile for our copper mining customers. It's 180 megawatts of solar plus 560-megawatt hours of storage will make it the largest battery storage installation in all of Latin America. We were also able to use 5b prefabricated solar panels for a portion of the project, which advances the learning and lowers the cost of future developments.\nTurning to Slide 8. We are on track to complete the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewable projects we committed to earlier this year, including nearly 800 megawatts we've already brought online. In the U.S., we expect to commission roughly 2.1 watts which is roughly double the capacity we installed last year. I am very proud of the work our teams have done to ensure that we have had no supply chain or construction delays. All of the necessary equipment has been contracted for our 2023 through 2025 backlog. There remains the potential for completion of up to an additional 600 megawatts this year in the U.S. given the strong performance of our construction program.\nWe see our record of completing projects on time as a key competitive advantage that is highly valued by our customers. We are one of the only major developers that did not abandon or meaningfully delay construction projects over the last 2 years due to supply chain issues. Furthermore, due to our emphasis on long-term planning and strong contractual agreements, we have maintained our project margins despite inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.\nNow moving to our second priority of utility growth on Slide 9. We remain on track to grow our U.S. pretax contribution at an annualized rate of 17% to 20% through 2027. At AES, Ohio, we expect to receive commission approval for our new electric security plan or ESP 4 by the end of August, at which point our new distribution rates would go into immediate effect. As a reminder, ESP 4 includes approval of timely recovery of $500 million in grid modernization over the next 3 years, carrying a 10% return on equity. This will allow us to accelerate investments to continue to improve the quality of service while maintaining the most competitive rates in Ohio.\nAt AES, Indiana, we filed for a new rate case in June, the first rate case since 2018. The proposed new rates are designed to recover inflationary impacts since the last case as well as investments in reliability, resiliency improvements and system upgrades. We expect commission approval by the middle of next year. Even after this proposed increase, we still expect our residential rates to be among the lowest in the state. At AES Indiana, we continue to advance our low carbon generation growth plan. We recently filed for approval to build a 200-megawatt or 800-megawatt hour storage facility at the site of the retiring Petersburg coal plant. This project is expected to come online by the end of next year, at which point it will be the largest battery storage project in the Midwest.\nNow turning to Slide 10 and our third priority of transforming our portfolio by exiting coal generation by the end of 2025. Since our Investor Day in May, we have significantly advanced our decarbonization objective by assuring the retirement of an additional 900 megawatts of coal generation. In June, we retired 415 megawatts of coal as we shut down Unit 2 of the Petersburg plant at AES Indiana. We also announced the retirement of the 276-megawatt Norgener air plant in Chile by 2025. Additionally, we received final approval, allowing for the termination of the PPA at our 205-megawatt Warrior Run plant in Maryland for proceeds of $357 million.\nNow turning to Slide 11. We have expanded our leadership in the development and application of new technologies in our sector. We see this as another important competitive advantage. A new example is the use of embedded artificial intelligence, including generative AI across our operations. This year, we already expect more than $200 million of our adjusted EBITDA to be enabled by AI through both cost reductions and revenue enhance. We have incorporated AI and data analytics across our operations from areas such as wind production forecasting to vegetation management to identification of isolated solar panel failures. As part of this program, we also continue to pioneer and advance the use of robotics to install and maintain solar panels. Through our solar robotics program, we are developing proprietary AI-based computer vision to install a wide variety of solar modules, including the largest and heaviest models. With this technology, we plan to install projects significantly faster and across a wide range of working conditions, including extreme heat.\nIn the coming months, we will be validating this technology for the installation of tens of megawatts and expect to move to use it for full scale solar projects in 2024. Finally, we're consolidating our lead in advanced green hydrogen projects with committed offtakers. We are currently developing the largest announced green hydrogen project in the U.S. jointly with Air Products in Texas. It features 1.4 gigawatts of inside defense, hourly matched renewables, 200 metric tons of hydrogen per day and a 30-year take-or-pay contract. It is expected to come online in 2027. Our pipeline of advanced green hydrogen projects is equivalent to more than 6 gigawatts of renewables and 800 metric tons of hydrogen per day.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results, 2023 parent capital allocation and 2023 guidance. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 13. I'm pleased to share that the second quarter was fully in line with our expectations, keeping us well on track to achieve our full year guidance. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million versus $722 million last year, driven primarily by lower margins at AES Andes and higher costs at our renewables SBU due to an accelerated growth plan, but partially offset by new renewables coming online and higher availability at select thermal businesses. Tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables projects were relatively flat at $38 million in the second quarter of this year, in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS was $0.21 versus $0.34 last year. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we saw higher parent interest expense this quarter. As a reminder, our year-to-date EPS is fully in line with the breakdown that we outlined earlier this year, in which we noted that roughly 25% of our earnings would come in the first half of the year and 75% in the second half.\nI'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 15. In the renewables SBU, we continue to execute on our strategic priority to triple our portfolio by 2027. For the second quarter, as expected, we saw higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes driven primarily by higher wind generation and new projects coming online, partially offset by higher business development and fixed costs due to our accelerated growth plan. At our utilities SBU, we saw higher adjusted PTC driven by lower maintenance expenses, but partially offset by higher interest expense from new debt. We continue to expect strong utilities earnings for the second half of the year driven by typical second half demand seasonality and the pending August decision on ESP 4 at AES, Ohio. With this pending decision and the great progress in renewables growth at AES Indiana, we are continuing to pursue our strategic priority to increase rate base by an average of 10% annually through 2027.\nLower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU, primarily reflects lower margins at AES Andes in line with our phase out of coal, partially offset by higher availability at select thermal units. As we execute -- our third strategic priority to exit coal and complete the transformation of our portfolio, although not every quarter, we generally expect to see annual year-over-year declines in energy infrastructure as we discussed at Investor Day in May.\nFinally, at our new energy technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects continued improved profit margins at Fluence. Fluence has shown year-over-year improvement for 3 straight quarters, and we are very pleased with the strong results they are delivering this year.\nNow to Slide 19. We are on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including growth at our U.S. utilities and contributions from new renewables projects coming online. As a reminder, the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables we expect to add this year represents an increase of over 75% compared to the 1.9 gigawatts we added to our portfolio last year. This amount also represents a doubling of new renewables in the U.S. versus 2022. This growth will be offset by approximately $200 million of LNG sales we've recorded primarily in the third quarter last year, which we do not expect to recur this year.\nIn addition to our adjusted EBITDA, we expect to realize $500 million to $560 million of tax attributes in 2023, bringing our total adjusted EBITDA plus tax attributes to $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion for the year.\nTurning to Slide 20. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. As a reminder, we expect our adjusted EPS to be heavily fourth quarter weighted due to the late year seasonality of our U.S. renewable project commissioning.\nNow to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21. Sources reflect approximately $2.4 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of asset sales and a $900 million parent debt issuance we completed in Q2. For more information on our debt issuances at the parent company and our subsidiaries, please refer to the appendix of the presentation.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital remains largely in line with guidance, with higher parent investment reflecting our recent acquisition of the 2-gigawatt Belfield project in the U.S. At our Investor Day in May, we outlined our capital allocation plan through 2027, including asset sales, along with debt and potential future equity issuances. We appreciate all of the feedback we've received, and I want to take a moment to clarify that we will only raise and invest capital in a way that's value accretive to our shareholders. Any potential future equity issuances would have to yield accretive value to shareholders for us to pursue equity as a source of capital. We are also committed to improving our credit profile over time and further bolstering our investment grade rating. We have a number of other levers to pull to support our growth such as increased capital recycling through asset sales and sell-downs. Given our strong asset sales track record and recent success, it is possible that any future equity issuances could be materially lower than the 5-year figure we previously shared. As always, our Investor Relations team is happy to take additional feedback and to follow up on additional questions or data requests.\nIn summary, we're continuing to make progress on transforming AES' portfolio while delivering strong growth in adjusted EBITDA, earnings and parent free cash flow. Our businesses are executing successfully and delivering on their commitments. We will continue to allocate our capital towards our high-growth renewables and utilities to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndres Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rates through 2027. We continue to make substantial progress on our strategic priorities, including tripling our installed renewables capacity by 2027, increasing the rate base at our U.S. utilities by more than 10% per year through 2027 and and transforming our portfolio by exiting coal by the end of 2025, while investing in new technologies.\nWe are delivering on all the commitments we made on our Q4 2022 earnings call and at our Investor Day presentation. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

Thank you for attending today's the AES Corporation First Quarter 2023 Financial Review. My name is Alicia, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations with AES Corporation. You may now proceed.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndres Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. And today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook. Beginning on Slide 3. As you may have seen in our press release, we introduced new strategic business units, which better reflect the greatly simplified company that AES is today and the pillars of our future growth. We will be giving a broader strategic review at our Investor Day on Monday, including an update on our portfolio transformation and an overview of our strong growth expectations for our renewables and utility businesses.\nOur first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 compared with $0.21 in 2022, which is in line with our expectations. With these results and the underlying performance we are seeing across our business, we are reaffirming our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75, and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. Now turning to Slide 4. We continue to see strong demand for renewables both in the U.S. and internationally, including from U.S. corporate customers with operations in international markets. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 309 megawatts of new renewables, including 154 megawatts of wind with a U.S. technology customer in Brazil. We're in advanced negotiations for several large additional projects and remain on track to meet our PPA signing target of 14 to 17 gigawatts over the next 3 years.\nIn the U.S., key elements of the inflation Reduction Act or IRA are being clarified. This past month, the Department of Treasury and the IRS release detailed guidance on how clean energy projects located in energy communities can qualify for an additional 10% bonus tax credit. We estimate that approximately 1/3 of our 51 gigawatt pipeline of projects in the U.S. would qualify, which directly translates into a combination of higher potential returns and increased competitiveness for the projects we are developing. We are currently awaiting treasury department guidance on certain provisions of the IRA, including requirements for the clean hydrogen production tax credit. As a reminder, at our green hydrogen project in Texas, the largest advanced green hydrogen project in the U.S., which we are developing jointly with Air Products. We plan to co-locate 1.4 gigawatts of new renewables with the electrolyzers. This means that the projects would have the lowest possible carbon emissions of any known project in the U.S. Additionally, the project is located adjacent to the site of a decommissioned coal plant, which will provide significant existing infrastructure.\nAll of these attributes and the fact that the energy will include hourly matching indicate that the project should qualify for the highest possible tax credit in any scenario. Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts is now around 12 gigawatts. Of which roughly half are already under construction. We continue to maintain a robust supply chain, and we continue to hit our construction milestones without delay. We expect to bring online more than 3 gigawatts of new wind, solar and battery storage this year. As we bring projects currently in the backlog online in coming years, we will nearly double our installed renewables capacity, making us one of the fastest-growing renewable companies in the world. Turning to Slide 6. We are also happy to report a positive development at AES Ohio. Which puts us on track for unprecedented growth in the business. In April, AES Ohio signed a comprehensive settlement agreement for its Electric Security Plan, or ESP 4 which received broad support from residential, commercial, industrial and low-income customers. The settlement included the commission staff as a signatory, and we expect to receive final approval by the end of the third quarter.\nWith ESP 4 in place, along with our existing investment programs, we expect to more than double our rate base by the end of 2027. And which would make AES Ohio, one of the fastest-growing utility businesses in the country, while still having the lowest tariffs in the state. Turning to Slide 7. We also reached a major milestone towards exiting coal by the end of 2025. We agreed to terminate the PPA at the Warrior Run plant in Maryland, for which we will receive total payments of $357 million. We will retain control of the site and are exploring new uses that capitalize on its valuable location and existing infrastructure. We see this transaction is very beneficial for all parties involved. Moving to Slide 8. We signed agreements to extend the operations of 1.4 gigawatts of gas generation at our legacy Southland units in California for 3 more years. These plans were previously scheduled to retire at the end of this year. The extensions will lock in additional upside and will help meet the state of California's grid liability needs while supporting its efforts to transition over time to low carbon source of electricity.\nThe monetization of the contract that Warrior Run and the extension of the legacy Southland units are both good examples of how we are creating value from our existing infrastructure assets during the energy transition. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we will be holding an Investor Day on Monday, where we will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, discussing our new business segments and providing long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, 2023 guidance and 2023 parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 10. As Andres mentioned, in the first quarter, we launched our new Strategic Business Units or SBUs. This new organizational structure reflects AES very focused and simplified portfolio. It also aligns our management teams by business line to maximize our operational synergies and to continue delivering excellent customer experiences across all our markets. Our new SBU reporting segments highlight our rapidly growing renewables and utility businesses and facilitate simplified modeling of AES, which will benefit current and new potential shareholders and analysts. Our new SBUs include renewables, which includes our solar, wind, energy storage and hydro businesses, utilities, which includes AES Indiana, AES Ohio and AES Salvador, Energy infrastructure composed of our thermal generation and LNG infrastructure businesses and new energy technologies, which includes our investments in energy technology businesses such as Fluence and Uplight as well as our green hydrogen business line and future new business innovations which support our mission.\nIn addition to the SBUs, we also have a corporate reporting segment, which includes our corporate G&A our parent level debt and associated interest expense in our captive insurance program called [ AGC ]. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.22 versus $0.21 last year. Our business was favorable year-over-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Our results were also impacted by higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. Now to Slide 12. We are fully on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. We expect a significant contribution from new renewables of at least $0.27 this year. This is partially offset by lower contributions from LNG sales, as we have previously mentioned, higher parent interest expense from incremental debt and higher rates on our revolving credit facility and a marginally higher tax rate this year. As is typically the case, our earnings are heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. This year, we expect approximately 3/4 of our earnings to occur in the second half.\nGrowth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including over 3 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online, which remains solidly on track for completion. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. Turning to Slide 13. As you may have seen in our press release, while we continue to report adjusted EPS, today, we are also introducing adjusted EBITDA as a new reporting metric. As the renewables portion of our business grows at an extremely high rate, we believe adjusted EBITDA is a very informative metric in understanding our business results. First, it aligns well with the performance of our underlying business and operating cash generation. And second, adjusted EBITDA is reported before the impact of U.S. renewables tax attributes so that investors and analysts can separate renewable operating earnings from the very valuable tax incentives for U.S. renewables Beginning this quarter, I will discuss our new SBU financial results using adjusted EBITDA, with the exception of our utilities SBU, which will be measured using adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, to facilitate comparisons with other utilities. We will provide full year guidance by SBU during our Investor Day on Monday.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $628 million this quarter versus $621 million in the prior year. This was driven by higher first quarter LNG sales and growth in renewables, but was partially offset by the impact of warmer than normal weather at our U.S. utilities. I'll cover the performance of our new SBUs in the next 4 slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 14. Higher EBITDA was driven primarily by a higher level of generation at our facilities in Panama higher wind generation and contributions from new businesses. This was partially offset by higher spend as we continue to ramp up our renewables development and lower power prices impacting our Bulgaria wind facility. Lower PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by warmer-than-normal winter weather and higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher revenues as a result of our continued investment in the rate base.\nHigher EBITDA and our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales, partially offset by lower margins from coal PPAs, the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii last year and lower availability at Southland Energy. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects a significant improvement in operations and gross margins at Fluence. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 18. Sources reflect approximately $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $950 million to $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of proceeds from asset sales and $700 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the previously announced 5% increase as well as the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion toward new growth, of which the majority will go to renewables and utilities.\nIn summary, we've made great progress on our financial commitments for the year. At our Investor Day on Monday, we will provide detail on the strategy and future of AES overall and for each of our new SBUs. We will also provide long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow. I look forward to talking with many of you then. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndres Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, we are pleased with our progress to date and remain on track to hit our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. We continue to see strong demand for renewables and especially from our corporate customers. Our supply chain is robust and our construction projects are progressing as planned. We're also encouraged by the settlement agreement at AS Ohio, which paves the way for final approval of our new electric security plan later this year and creates the framework for significant investments in the utility. Finally, we see our successful negotiations to terminate the Warrior Run contract and extend the operations of the 1.4 gigawatts of our legacy South line units as indicative of the success we are having in maximizing shareholder value from our existing assets as we transform the portfolio.\nWe look forward to providing a broader strategic update at our Investor Day on Monday, including more details around our growth plans and guidance through 2027. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Thank you."

My name is Candice, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand you over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, the floor is yours. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review call.

And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2022 financial results and strategic accomplishments as well as our 2023 guidance. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly.\nBeginning with our 2022 results and accomplishments on Slide 3. I am very pleased with our performance in 2022, which was our best year ever. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.67, above our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. This accomplishment is primarily the result of 3 factors: strong performance across our portfolio, growth in renewables particularly from solar and energy storage in the U.S. and the benefit of embedded optionality in our LNG contracts.\nTurning to Slide 4. I would like to highlight an area in which we are particularly proud of our performance. Our success in bringing our construction projects online. In 2022, despite numerous market-wide challenges throughout the year, we added approximately 2 gigawatts of new projects to our portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nOur success was the result of the extensive work we have done to develop the people, processes and solid supplier relationships to rapidly expand our portfolio of renewables. We see our ability to execute as the source of competitive advantage that is highly valued in the marketplace. Not only does it support our strong global customer relationships, but it also contributes to our confidence in our long-term forecast.\nIn addition to our execution, 2022 was a year where we focused on taking actions that will position us well for future growth. These actions included: signing a record number of new PPAs for projects that we will complete in the coming years, investing in our pipeline of future projects, creating a leading position in green hydrogen, establishing strong regulatory foundations to support future utility growth and achieving significant coal phaseout milestones in Hawaii and Chile.\nAs you can see on Slide 5. 2022 was a record year for PPA signings for AES. We signed 5.2 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts, increasing our backlog to 12.2 gigawatts. In fact, for the second year in a row, BNEF reported that AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers than anyone else in the world. This included an expansion of our 24/7 structured projects.\nMoving to Slide 6. We also worked hard throughout the year to grow our pipeline of future projects, which increased by 25% to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. We see extensive and growing demand for renewables worldwide and expect that in the future, a key limitation to growth will be the availability of projects. We have been preparing by investing in land, interconnections and permitting work to advance the projects that will be used for future PPA signings.\nTurning to Slide 7. We also established ourselves as a leader in green hydrogen. In December, we announced a partnership with Air Products to develop, build and own and operate the largest green hydrogen production facility in the U.S. This project will have the capacity to produce more than 200 metric tons per day of green hydrogen and will include approximately 1.4 gigawatts of wind and solar generation. It builds upon the expertise we have developed in combining renewables to create around-the-clock carbon-free energy. This project has the potential to serve approximately 4,000 trucks, which, while significant, represents less than 0.1% of the current market for long-haul trucking. As such, we see a massive total addressable market for decarbonizing the transportation sector.\nTurning to Slide 8. Another focus of our 2022 work was to develop strong regulatory foundations for future growth at our U.S. utilities, where we expect to grow the combined rate basis 9% annually through 2025. Specifically, at AES Ohio, we filed a new Electric Security Plan or ESP 4, to enhance and upgrade the network and improve service reliability. With the lowest T&D rates in the states across all customer categories, AES Ohio is well positioned to make the much-needed customer-centric investments. A ruling by the Ohio Commission on ESP 4 is expected this summer.\nFinally, we're pleased with the constructive outcome of AES Ohio's distribution rate case in which the Ohio Commission approved an annual revenue increase of $75.6 million. At AES Indiana, we filed our Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in December. AES Indiana's near-term plan includes the conversion of the utility's last 2 coal units to natural gas in 2025 using an existing on-site gas pipeline. It also includes the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of new wind, solar and energy storage by 2027 and should reduce AES Indiana's carbon intensity by 2/3 from 2018 to 2030. This plan is an important step to fully transition away from coal and provides the opportunity for substantial additional investments at AES Indiana.\nNow turning to our outlook for 2023 on Slide 9. Today, we are initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 and reaffirming our long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% through 2025 for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow off a base year of 2020. Our focus this year will remain on execution.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, we expect to complete approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.1 gigawatts in the U.S. I will note that our 2023 guidance range does not include a potential upside from 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to be completed in December 2023, but which are likely to come online in 2024.\nLooking at our growth through 2025 on Slide 11. We expect to maintain the pace of PPA signings we have established with an estimated 14 to 17 gigawatts expected to be signed over the next 3 years. We see strong demand for renewables across all of our key markets, particularly the U.S., where the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, are becoming even clear. Thus, given the strength of our backlog and our visibility into future PPA signings and project completions, we are confident in reaffirming our long-term guidance through 2025.\nFinally, today, we're announcing that we will hold an Investor Day this spring. We will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, introducing new business segments and extending our long-term growth rate. We will provide additional details at a later date.\nWith that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics: our financial performance during 2022, our parent capital allocation and our 2023 guidance and expectations through 2025.\nAs Andres mentioned, our results for 2022 demonstrate the strength, resiliency and flexibility of our portfolio as we surpassed our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Overall, our portfolio is well structured to perform in the current market environment and is well positioned for growth as AES continues to lead the global energy transition.\nTurning to Slide 13. Full year 2022 adjusted EPS was $1.67 versus $1.52 in 2021, driven primarily by a significant volume of LNG sales and our increased ownership of AES Andes. These positive drivers were partially offset by unplanned outages, several onetime expenses we recorded at our U.S. in utilities and South America SBUs, a higher share count as a result of the 2021 accounting adjustment for our equity units and higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances. The $1.67 per share also includes approximately $0.12 of losses from AES Next, primarily from our ownership in Fluence, which served as an additional drag year-over-year. We expect Fluence's results to significantly improve beginning this year, as they discussed on their recent earnings call.\nTurning to Slide 14. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of $149 million and 11% growth over 2021. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 15.\nLower PTC in the U.S. was primarily driven by the recognition of one-time expenses from previously deferred purchased fuel and energy costs at our utilities. Outages at Southland Energy and AES Indiana in the second quarter and lower contributions from Clean Energy and the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii, partially offset by higher contributions from our Southland legacy assets in the third quarter.\nHigher PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and AES Brasil, but partially offset by a prior year gain related to an arbitration at Alto Maipo. Outages at AES Andes and a one-time regulatory provision in Argentina.\nHigher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects to benefit from a large volume of LNG sales redirected to the international market. As I'll discuss later, we do not expect an opportunity of the same scale to recur this year and anticipate lower PTC from MCAC in 2023. The LNG sales were partially offset by the full year impact from the sale of our coal plant in the Dominican Republic in 2021.\nFinally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net decline driven by higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher energy prices earned at our wind plant in Bulgaria.\nNow let's turn to how we allocated our capital in 2022 on Slide 19. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of $906 million, which was near the top end of our guidance expectations. Asset sales were below our expectations for the year, but we still expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in proceeds by 2025. Given the delay in asset sales, we accelerated the issuance of some parent debt which is within our long-term expectations.\nMoving to uses on the right-hand side. We invested more than $700 million in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately 2/3 were in the U.S. We also allocated nearly $500 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend.\nTurning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 20. Today, we are initiating 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.65 to $1.75. This year, we expect to commission approximately 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables, which is the largest year-over-year increase in AES history. This growth further validates AES position as a leader in renewables and highlights the outstanding efforts of our commercial and operations teams in our markets. Roughly 65% of this new renewable capacity is located in the U.S. More than half our total 2023 adjusted PTC will come from the U.S. this year as we execute on the transformation of our portfolio.\nAs I discussed last quarter, our U.S. renewables projects benefit from both investment tax credits and production tax credits. Our 2023 guidance includes approximately $500 million of adjusted PTC from tax credits generated and recognized by new U.S. renewable projects coming online this year, which is approximately double the amount from 2022. Tax credits are an important component of our renewables business earnings and cash flow, and we intend to provide updates on our 2023 tax credit expectations throughout the year.\nWhile the midpoint of our 2023 guidance range is below our long-term annual growth target. We are reaffirming the 7% to 9% growth rate through 2025. 2023 growth is lower than the long-term trend for a few reasons. First, we've taken a conservative approach to modeling renewables projects expected to come online in 2023. Our renewables construction is typically concentrated in the fourth quarter, and this year will be no exception.\nAs a result, construction delays of only a few days could cause a project to shift from 2023 to 2024 and negatively impact this year's results. This is particularly relevant for our U.S. renewables projects, where we recognized significant earnings from investment tax credits in the year, a project is placed into service. Of the 2.1 gigawatts we plan to complete in 2023, 2/3 are expected to come online in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that an additional 600 megawatts of projects currently scheduled to come online in December, slip into 2024. If some or all of these projects are completed on schedule, this will create up to $0.10 of upside to our 2023 guidance. It's also important to note that even if there are delays to next year, this is only a timing issue with no material value impact and would support higher growth in 2024 with no impact on our long-term growth rate expectations.\nSecond, we expect to see lower contributions from our MCAC SBU on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by more than $200 million of adjusted PTC from LNG sales we executed in 2022. Our commercial team was able to leverage the optionality embedded in our LNG supply contracts to capitalize on high international gas prices by redirecting Henry Hub-linked LNG cargoes to the international market. Although LNG sales will continue in 2023, we do not expect the same magnitude of opportunity as the spreads between Henry Hub and international gas prices have compressed and more of our gas supply this year is linked to TTF international prices rather than Henry Hub.\nThird, we expect to see lower margins at our Chile business this year, particularly in the first half of the year, which is a temporary impact of our Green Blend and Extend strategy to transition our customers from coal power to renewables. Several coal PPAs have or will expire this year, as we proceed with our intent to fully exit coal by 2025, and others have been restructured to be priced off renewables that are still under construction. We view this as a short-term cost of decarbonizing our portfolio and do not expect any impact to our 7% to 9% long-term growth rate.\nLooking ahead, our teams are working on commercial solutions to mitigate the dilution as the portion of our earnings from coal continues to decline. Based on the drivers discussed, we expect our 2023 earnings to be significantly second half weighted with approximately 3 quarters recognized in the second half of the year. While we typically have had about 2/3 of our earnings in the second half, the increase in seasonality this year is driven by the significant volume of new U.S. renewable projects coming online in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21, beginning with approximately $2.2 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2023, is expected to be $950 million to $1 billion, in line with our annualized growth target. In addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate $400 million to $600 million in asset sale proceeds this year. This includes our previously announced sale in Jordan as well as the pending sell-down of some of our operating renewables in the U.S.\nI also want to point out that we intend to relaunch the sale process for our Mong Duong coal plant in Vietnam to better align with the approval requirements that became clear during the initial sale. The remaining portion of our 2023 asset sales is expected to come from additional sell-downs and sales supporting our decarbonization goals.\nNow to the Uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion toward new growth, of which about 2/3 will be allocated in the U.S. to renewables and to increase our utility rate base. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 5% increase.\nIn summary, we exceeded our financial commitments for 2022 and are confident in this year's guidance and the long-term outlook for AES. The energy transition provides tremendous investment and innovation opportunities, and I believe no company is better positioned than AES to lead this transition. As we execute on our strategy, we will continue to deliver on our financial commitments to maximize per share value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, 2022 was our best year ever. Not only did we meet or exceed our targets for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow, but we signed more PPAs and added more renewables to our portfolio than ever before. Once again, we were recognized by BNEF as the top developer worldwide, selling clean energy to corporations through PPAs. We also launched the first mega scale green hydrogen project in the U.S. and developed a regulatory foundation that will enable us to grow our U.S. utilities by 9% annually through 2025.\nLooking forward, we are very well positioned for the future. Our leadership in corporate PPAs and green hydrogen gives a line of sight into our continued success. We remain focused on executing on our construction program and further developing our pipeline of potential future projects. And we are on track to exit coal by the end of 2025.\nWith that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

My name is Glenn, and I will be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand you over to your host, Susan, to begin. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 financial review call. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.63, bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $1.18. With these results, we now expect our full year adjusted EPS to come in at or near the high end of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65.\nWe're also reaffirming our 7% to 9% annualized growth target for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results in more detail shortly. Our business model continues to demonstrate its resilience with strong contractual protections and natural hedges that have insulated us well from foreign currency movements, higher interest rates and volatile commodity prices. In addition, the vast majority of our business is with U.S. utilities or investment-grade off-takers.\nTurning to Slide 4. At the same time, we have built flexibility into our portfolio, which has allowed us to capture upside in the current environment. For example, in Panama, we've been able to redirect Henry Hub priced LNG to European markets to capitalize on high international gas prices.\nThis upside is the direct result of actions we took in the past to create a diverse portfolio that would limit our downside exposure to fluctuations, both in commodity prices and hydrology. With above-average rainfall in Panama this year, we have been able to buy cheap hydro power and run our gas plant less, which has made it possible to redirect a portion of our contracted LNG creating meaningful upside in our results.\nNow to Slide 5. We spoke briefly about the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, on our previous call. But since then, it has become even more apparent how it is likely to greatly accelerate the demand for renewables and stand-alone storage in the U.S. We are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and growth through our market leadership in renewables, particularly in the C&I segment due to our strong customer relationship, our ownership interest influence and our extensive and growing pipeline.\nSpecifically, the IRA extends the Production Tax Credit, or PTC, and the Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, for 10 years and provides additional tax credits for energy communities such as low-income areas or places where coal mining or thermal generation previously took place. We anticipate that the benefits of the IRA will result in a meaningful step-up in demand across the U.S., but particularly from C&I customers looking to reach their decarbonization goals.\nThe IRA also includes a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage. AES benefits not only from being one of the largest developers of energy storage projects, but also from our ownership stake influence, the market leader in energy storage integration. We see battery-based energy storage as an essential enabler of more renewables on the grid by reducing intermittency and providing renewables-based capacity.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, to address this expected growth in demand, we have been working hard to grow our pipeline of renewables and energy storage projects. Today, our pipeline stands at 64 gigawatts or more than twice the size of our entire current portfolio. The majority of our pipeline, 51 gigawatts is in the U.S. and much of it is in the most attractive markets for renewables such as California and PJM.\nOur pipeline consists of projects that have a combination of land, interconnection access or advanced permitting. Approximately 1/3 of our pipeline is in the energy communities that I previously described and are eligible for additional tax credits. We believe our pipeline will become increasingly valuable as sites for projects become scarcer.\nTurning to Slide 7. At the same time, since our last earnings call in August, we have signed an additional 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs or 3.2 gigawatts year-to-date. Furthermore, we are in very advanced late-stage discussions on several large contracts that we expect will bring us within our full year range of 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts.\nToday, our backlog of signed PPAs stands at 11.2 gigawatts, the majority of which is expected to come online by 2025. We remain largely on track with our construction program, which is now 5.2 gigawatts. There are some projects that have been moved from this year to next, primarily due to delays from customers. But as we've mentioned before, none of these projects are late due to a lack of solar panels.\nWe also continue to make very good progress on our 2 very large green hydrogen projects in the U.S. and Chile, which include the integration of electrolyzers and renewables. Although we don't have any specific announcements to make today, we are confident that we will have more to share with you on this important initiative before the end of the year.\nTurning to Slide 8 for an update on growth initiatives at our U.S. utilities. This quarter, AES Ohio filed a new electric security plan or ESP 4, which outlines a comprehensive road map to position AES Ohio to resolve outstanding regulatory proceedings and make significant investments to modernize its network.\nThe filing is a substantial achievement for AES Ohio as it will lay a strong regulatory foundation for growth by implementing a more traditional utility rate structure. We expect the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to approve ESP 4 in the next 12 months. As a reminder, AES Ohio has the lowest T&D rates in the state across all customer groups, and we see significant opportunity to invest to improve reliability and strengthen the balance sheet, while remaining cost competitive.\nFinally, AES Indiana is in the last phases of its integrated resource plan process and plans to file the 2022 IRP report with the state regulator by December 1. The proposal includes another milestone in AES' decarbonization plan with the conversion of the last remaining units of coal operated by AES Indiana to natural gas in 2025 and the addition of up to 1.3 gigawatts of renewables, including wind, solar and battery storage.\nWith that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance.\nTurning to our financial results for the quarter beginning on Slide 10. I'm pleased to share that our third quarter results are very strong, and we now expect to be at or near the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.63 versus $0.50 last year, driven primarily by our LNG business, as Andres discussed. In addition, we also benefited from an increased ownership in AES Andes as well as higher margins in Brazil.\nThese positive contributions were partially offset by onetime charges at our U.S. utilities in Argentina businesses. Relative to last year, we also had higher losses from our AES Next portfolio as financial results from Fluence were not reported in our Q3 numbers last year, higher parent interest stemming from higher debt balances as we increase investment in our subsidiaries and a higher adjusted tax rate due to a nonrecurring benefit in Q3 2021.\nI should also note that despite considerable macroeconomic volatility, we see very little impact on our financial performance. For example, the forecasted full year impact of foreign currency movements after tax is well under $0.01 of adjusted EPS due to our highly contrasted and largely dollarized business, along with our very active hedging program. In addition, nearly 80% of our debt is either fixed rate or hedged against interest rate exposure and approximately 82% of our revenue is protected by inflation index for hedging.\nTurning to Slide 11. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $569 million for the quarter, a $141 million increase year-over-year due to the drivers I just discussed.\nI'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 12. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC was driven primarily recognition of onetime expenses at our U.S. utilities from previously deferred purchase fuel and energy costs. Including those related to an outage at our Eagle Valley plant from April 2021 to March 2022.\nWe pursued and entered into a settlement for Eagle Valley and took a provision against a deferred fuel recovery asset at AES Ohio, which we will continue to pursue. These expenses impacted adjusted PTC by approximately $48 million in the third quarter. In addition, lower PTC was driven by lower availability in Puerto Rico.\nOur legacy Southland units provided significant energy margin contribution again in the third quarter this year, although this was not a material year-over-year driver. We are also very pleased that in the third quarter, the California State Regulatory Authorities formally launched the process required to further extend our Southland legacy units beyond 2023. Higher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by our increased ownership of AES Andes and higher margins at both AES Andes and Brazil, but partially offset by a provision in Argentina.\nHigher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU primarily reflects our commercial team's outstanding effort to redirect our LNG supply from Panama to the international market as discussed earlier. These LNG sales were enabled by the flexibility we built into our commercial structure and gas supply agreements along with favorable market conditions, which may be present going forward, although we expect to a more limited extent.\nFinally, in Eurasia, adjusted PTC was relatively flat year-over-year with an overall net benefit from higher power prices at our wind plant in Bulgaria. Now to Slide 16. As a result of our overall strong performance year-to-date, along with the significant contribution from LNG sales, we now expect to come in at or near the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65.\nGrowth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including roughly 500 megawatts of projects under construction coming online as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES Andes. We expect to recognize additional LNG sales in the fourth quarter, but the contribution will be much smaller than the benefit in Q3. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% annualized growth target through 2025, based primarily on our expected growth in renewables, energy storage and U.S. utilities.\nTurning to Slide 17. As Andres highlighted, the Inflation Reduction Act extended and expanded the tax incentives available for U.S. renewables and energy storage. Tax credits have been an important part of the economic value creation of our U.S. renewables portfolio, and the IRA provides clarity on long-term eligibility for these credits. As U.S. renewables become a larger share of our portfolio, I want to briefly touch on the way these tax incentives contribute to our earnings and cash flow.\nOur U.S. wind projects are typically eligible for production tax credits over the first 10 years of operations. Our solar and solar plus storage projects typically qualify for an investment tax credit generally recognized within the first 2 years, the project begins commercial operations. To ensure we take full advantage of the tax value of our U.S. renewables, we usually bring on partners that will invest in these projects to be allocated the majority of the associated tax attributes. These are called tax equity partnerships.\nIt's important to recognize that as we monetize these tax credits, they create earnings and cash for AES. For full year 2022, we expect our projects to generate approximately $280 million to $310 million in new tax credits. After monetizing these credits through our tax equity partnerships, the earnings recognized by AES this year from new project commissionings will be approximately $200 million to $230 million, with the remaining earnings from tax credits to be largely recognized next year.\nDue to the late year seasonality of new project commissionings, approximately 2/3 of these earnings will occur in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to commission more projects in the fourth quarter than in 2021 which will benefit our earnings in the year-to-go period, improving the year-over-year comparison of adjusted PTC in our U.S. and Utilities SBU by the end of the year.\nNow to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 18. Sources reflect approximately $1.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $900 million of parent free cash flow, $500 million of asset sales and $200 million of new parent debt. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase announced last December and the coupon on the equity units.\nWe plan to invest approximately $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. About half of these investments are in renewables, which represent the largest portion of our growth. Nearly 1/4 of these investments are in our U.S. utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization.\nIn summary, nearly 3/4 of our investments this year are going to grow AES' renewables businesses in our U.S. utilities, reflecting our commitment to continue executing on our portfolio transformation. In addition, approximately 70% of our planned future investments are targeted for our U.S. subsidiaries, which will contribute to our goal of more than 50% of our earnings coming from the U.S. in 2023. I look forward to AES continuing our strong performance this year and sharing updates with you on our fourth quarter call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, we now expect our 2022 adjusted EPS to come in at or near the high end of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65, and we are reaffirming our 7% to 9% annualized growth target for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025. Our strong financial results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio to macroeconomic volatility. We signed additional agreements that will redirect excess LNG from our business in Panama to international customers.\nWe expect the Inflation Reduction Act to greatly accelerate the demand for renewables, stand-alone storage and green hydrogen. To address this growth in demand, we have increased our pipeline to 64 gigawatts, including 51 gigawatts in the U.S. and year-to-date, we have signed 3.2 gigawatts of renewables and energy storage under long-term contracts, and we are in late-stage discussions on several more that we expect will bring us within our full year range of 4.5 to 5.5 kilowatts.\nWith that, I would like to open the call for questions."

Welcome to The AES Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Financial Review Call. My name is Irene, and I will be coordinating this event. (Operator Instructions).\nI would like to turn the conference over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.

As you have seen from our earnings release, we reported second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.34, which was in line with our expectations and consistent with our historical quarterly earnings profile. Our CFO, Steve Coughlin, will discuss our financial results in more detail.\nBased on our year-to-date results and outlook for the second half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2022 guidance and our expectation for annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow of 7% to 9% through 2025. I would also note that our guidance and expectations do not include any benefit from proposed U.S. climate legislation, which we see as a meaningful source of potential upside as it would drive additional demand for renewables and energy storage and accelerate the development of green hydrogen projects in the U.S.\nThis morning, I will discuss our strategy in the context of 2 broad themes: First, our resilience to macroeconomic volatility, including high inflation, high commodity prices, fluctuations in foreign currency and ongoing supply chain constraints; and second, continued strong demand for renewables, particularly from corporate and industrial customers.\nWith this backdrop in mind, I will discuss the robustness of our business and also review our disciplined approach to growth, both of which provide us with full confidence in our ability to hit our financial and strategic goals this year and beyond.\nBeginning with our resilience on Slide 4. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, our financial results this quarter were insulated from the impacts of rising inflation, depreciating U.S. dollar and volatile commodity prices. We do not expect any of these factors to have any impact on our full year results. As I had discussed on previous calls, 85% of our adjusted pretax contribution is derived from long-term contracts for generation and our regulated utilities.\nFor the 15% of our earnings that is not derived from long-term contracts or utilities, such as our legacy Southland business in California, or the 10% that is not denominated in U.S. dollars, we have largely hedged both exposures. In some cases, our strong contractual arrangements have allowed for additional upside. Throughout 2022, we have signed agreements to redirect excess LNG from Panama to international customers. The benefits of these agreements will accrue through the remainder of the year, and we have the potential to sign similar agreements next year depending on market conditions.\nTurning to construction and supply chains on Slide 5. Our strategic sourcing and ability to execute on our commitments, our key competitive advantages and we expect to complete all of the projects in our 10.5 gigawatt backlog with no cancellations or significant changes. We take a proactive approach to working with our suppliers, and as a result, we had all of the solar panels required for our 2022 projects in country earlier this year.\nMore recently, we worked to quickly resume imports following the Biden administration's June Executive Order, and none of our suppliers' panels have been stopped by customs this year. We also took decisive steps to further decrease solar panel supply risk by creating a more robust U.S. supply chain. In June, we launched the U.S. Solar Buyer Consortium along with 3 other solar developers to significantly drive the expansion of domestic solar manufacturing. Collectively, we committed to purchasing more than $6 billion of solar panels from manufacturers that can supply up to 7 gigawatts of solar modules per year made in the U.S.A. starting from 2024.\nTherefore, despite industry-wide supply chain challenges, we do not anticipate any major delays to our U.S. renewables backlog of 5.9 gigawatts. I would note that only 2 projects have been shifted from 2022 to 2023, and these were moved as a result of changes requested by customers with no impact on our guidance and expectations for this year or next. In addition, we recently broke ground on the largest utility scale solar plus storage project in the state of Hawaii. Across the states, we have more renewable projects under development and/or under construction than anyone else.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, we anticipate completing 1.8 gigawatts of new renewables globally this year, 4.6 gigawatts next year for a total of 6.4 gigawatts by the end of 2023.\nTurning to Slide 7. Looking to our future growth. We continue to see strong demand for renewables from our key customer groups. Despite increases in the cost of renewables, resulting from inflation and supply chain constraints, a far greater increase in the cost of fossil fuels has made renewable energy even more price competitive. As a result, demand from corporate customers has never been higher.\nSo far this year, we have signed or been awarded 1.6 gigawatts of long-term renewable PPAs, the majority of which have been negotiated on a bilateral basis. For full year 2022, we continue to expect to reach a total of 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts.\nAs shown on Slide 8, we now have a backlog of 10.5 gigawatts, all of which is expected to come online through 2025.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'd like to note that we currently have 13.7 gigawatts of renewables and operations. So this backlog of projects in construction or with signed PPAs, represent more than 75% growth in our installed renewable capacity over the next 4 years. Including additional PPAs we expect to sign by 2025, our portfolio will grow to almost 50 gigawatts, of which 77% will be renewables. We also expect to have completely exited coal at that time.\nAs we scale up in renewables, we continue to complement our portfolio with innovative businesses and solutions, which require the best talent in order to deliver on our commitments. Earlier this week, Fast Company recognized AES in their top 10 rankings of Best Workplaces for Innovators and as is the winner in the category of Best Workplaces for Early Career Innovator. We are very proud of receiving this recognition and our innovative teams and their many accomplishments.\nAdditionally, although we don't have any specific announcements to make today, we continue to make good progress on our 2 large green hydrogen projects in the U.S. and Chile. These projects include the integration of electrolyzers and renewable and have the potential to provide significant new sources of growth. I will provide additional updates in the coming months. In the meantime, we launched a 2.5-megawatt pilot project in Chile. This project will be a hydrogen fueling station and will produce up to 1 metric ton of green hydrogen per day.\nFinally, turning to Slide 10. Growth opportunities at our U.S. utilities represent one of the key drivers of our overall 7% to 9% annual growth in earnings and cash flows. This growth also advances our objective of increasing the proportion of our earnings from the U.S. to 50%. As a reminder, in both Indiana and Ohio, we have the lowest residential rates in each state, providing a great runway for growth and investment, while keeping rates affordable for our customers.\nThrough 2025, we expect to invest a total of $4 billion in new renewables generation, transmission, modernization and smart grid at our U.S. utilities. These investments will improve our customers' experience and translate to average annual rate base growth of 9%, which is at the high end of growth projection for U.S. utilities. We expect the earnings from these core businesses to grow in line with the rate base.\nAt AES Ohio, we are currently awaiting the commission's decision on our distribution rate case. As a reminder, we see significant opportunity to invest, to improve reliability and strengthen AES Ohio's balance sheet, while remaining cost competitive.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results, 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance.\nTurning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 12. I'm pleased to share that we had a good second quarter in line with our expectations, which keeps us well on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 versus $0.31 last year, driven by growth in our core business segments, higher margins, primarily at AES Andes and a lower adjusted tax rate. These positive contributions were partially offset by the higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment we made for our equity units, higher parent interest expense related to growth funding and onetime outages at select thermal businesses. These outages were primarily driven by turbine manufacturer component defects and the plants impacted are now all back online.\nThere are 2 additional points I would like to highlight from the second quarter. First, we successfully closed several nonrecourse subsidiary financings, extending tenures at very attractive rates and expanding facilities that support our renewables growth. And second, our collections and days sales outstanding in all of our businesses remain strong, reflecting our predominantly investment-grade rated customer base.\nTurning to Slide 13. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $304 million for the quarter, which was relatively flat year-over-year, consistent with the drivers I just discussed. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units, or SBUs, in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 14. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC was driven primarily by outages at Southland and AES Indiana as well as lower contributions from AES Clean Energy due to increased investment in renewables development. Contributions from new Clean Energy project commissionings will be more skewed to the second half of the year.\nHigher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by higher contributions from AES Andes resulting from our increased ownership as well as higher margins, but partially offset by the outages I previously mentioned. Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and Caribbean, or MCAC SBU, primarily reflects favorable market conditions caused by better hydrology in Panama. As Andres discussed, the reduced need for thermal generation in Panama has allowed us to sell our excess LNG on the international market at higher prices, which will serve as a positive driver in the remainder of the year. Finally, in Eurasia, while our business performance has been very strong, the lower PTC reflects higher interest expense coming from additional nonrecourse debt at one of our Eurasia holders.\nNow to Slide 18. We are on track to achieve our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Our typical quarterly earnings profile is more heavily weighted toward Q3 and Q4 with about 2/3 of our earnings occurring in the second half of the year. We continue to expect a similar profile this year as we grow more in the U.S., where earnings are higher in the second half based on solar generation profiles, utility demand seasonality, the commissioning of more new projects in the third and fourth quarters and higher demand at Southland and the peak cooling months in Southern California.\nGrowth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including 1.4 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online over the next 6 months as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES Andes, higher LNG revenues and growth at our U.S. utilities. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025 based on our expected growth in renewables, energy storage and U.S. utilities. Our guidance also assumes the recycling of capital from many of our thermal businesses into those 3 growth areas across our portfolio.\nNow to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Sources reflect approximately $1.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $900 million of parent free cash flow. Due to timing uncertainty around our planned asset sales, we are now expecting to achieve the lower end of our $500 million to $700 million asset sales target within the year, with the remaining sales expected to close in 2023. To fund our strong growth expectations until the asset sales are completed, we plan to issue approximately $200 million of new parent debt, which was already included in the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out earlier this year.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced last December and a coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth. About half of these investments are in renewables, reflecting our success in securing new long-term contracts during 2021 and our expectations for 2022. Nearly 1/4 of these investments are in our U.S. Utilities to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization.\nIn summary, nearly 3/4 of our investments this year are going to grow AES' renewables businesses in our U.S. utilities, reflecting our commitment to continue executing on AES' portfolio transformation. We have made great progress on our growth investments so far this year and remain on track with our annual investment targets. We will continue to allocate our capital in line with our strategy to lead in renewables, grow our utilities by 9% annually and to recycle capital out of thermal assets to decarbonize our portfolio.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, our actions and strategy have put us in a strong position to achieve this year's guidance and a 7% to 9% annualized growth through 2025. Once again, our portfolio of businesses is proving its resilience to any macroeconomic volatility in the U.S. or internationally. We have signed or been awarded 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs year-to-date, and we're targeting 4.5 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts this year. Our backlog has reached 10.5 gigawatts, and our construction schedule has not been affected by supply chain issues.\nTo further derisk our supply chain, we have led a consortium to buy up to 7 gigawatts of U.S.-made solar panels annually, starting in 2024. Finally, we see significant upside to our growth, including green hydrogen in the U.S., should the proposed Inflation Reduction Act be approved.\nWith that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

Thank you for attending today's AES First Quarter 2022 Financial Review Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI now have the pleasure of handing the conference over to our host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations with AES. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 financial review call. I am very happy to report that we have attained an investment-grade rating for Moody's. We are now investment-grade rated by all 3 major agencies, which is an important milestone for our company, and reflects a decade worth of work to transform our business.\nWe're also reaffirming our 2022 guidance and annualized growth of 7% to 9% through 2025. Our business model continues to demonstrate its resilience and predictability even in the face of market volatility. Steve will cover our expectations for the remainder of the year in more detail, including the seasonality of our earnings profile.\nToday, I will discuss our 2022 construction program and the Department of Commerce's investigation into solar panel imports, the diverse drivers of our growth, including signed renewable energy PPAs and our U.S. utility, AES Next influence, and our strategic outlook for the sector, beginning with our 2022 construction program on Slide 4.\nWe are laser-focused on ensuring timely completion of projects. As we see our ability to execute on our commitments as a key source of competitive advantage. This year, we expect to complete more than 2 gigawatts of new renewables, including over 800 megawatts of solar in the U.S.\nIn late March, the U.S. Department of Commerce launched an investigation into solar imports from 4 Southeast Asian countries, which collectively supply approximately 80% of solar panels for the U.S. market. The Department of Commerce is expected to make a preliminary determination on this case by no later than August. The resulting uncertainty around tariff levels has led to a drop in imports and project delays across the industry. However, due to our supply chain strategy, all of the panels for our 830 megawatts of projects to be completed in 2022 in the U.S. are already in country, and we do not anticipate any delays to those projects.\nI'd also note that 1/3 of our 2022 renewable projects are international and the remaining 683 megawatts in the U.S. are wind and energy storage.\nMoving to the diverse drivers of future growth, beginning on Slide 5. Our strategy is to provide differentiated products that allow us to work with our customers on a bilateral basis. As a result, last year, we signed a total of 5 gigawatts of PPAs for renewable energy, including more contracts with C&I customers than anyone else in the world.\nFor full year 2022, we continue to expect to sign 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts with a roughly 50-50 split between the U.S. and international markets. We do expect PPA signings in the U.S. to be more weighted towards the second half of the year. So far this year, we have signed or been awarded 1.1 gigawatts, bringing our backlog to 10.3 gigawatts.\nDespite current headwinds for the sector, such as delays in U.S. climate legislation, and the supply chain issues we just discussed, we continue to see very strong demand for low-carbon energy and especially for structured products, such as our 24/7 renewable offering. In fact, as you may have seen earlier this week, we announced 2 key agreements for our structured products.\nFirst, the expansion of our partnership with Microsoft into California, the third market where we will supply renewable energy to match the load at their data centers; and second, our agreement with Amazon, under which we will provide 675 megawatts of renewable energy to their operations in California, including AWS' data centers.\nWith these agreements, we are helping both companies achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. As you can see on Slide 6, we believe our development pipeline of 59 gigawatts is the second largest among U.S. renewables developers. This robust pipeline provides us with the projects we need to deliver on our backlog and continue to build on our competitive position in the market.\nNow turning to our regulated U.S. utility platforms, beginning on Slide 7. These businesses represent one of the key contributors to our overall 7% to 9% annual growth in earnings and cash flow as well as advancing our objective of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to 50%.\nIn both markets, we have the lowest residential rates in the entire state which provides a runway for growth and investment while keeping affordable rates for our customers.\nMoving to Slide 8. In Indiana, we're benefiting from incentives to modernize the transmission and distribution network and transitioning to greener generation. Through 2025, we will be investing $2.7 billion, which we will recover through already approved rate mechanisms.\nAdditionally, we expect to finalize our next integrated resource plan by this fall, allowing us to further transform AES Indiana's generation fuel mix.\nIn Ohio, we're capitalizing on FERC formula rate-based investments in the transmission network.\nAt the same time, we are implementing our Smart Grid investment program, which is recovered through an existing rate mechanism.\nWe also have a distribution rate case pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Later this month, we will be presenting oral arguments directly to the commission and a favorable outcome, in this case, will bolster our ability to make the new investments needed to further strengthen AES Ohio's network.\nTurning to Slide 9. Through 2025, we expect to invest $4 billion to modernize our U.S. utilities. These investments translate to average annual rate base growth of 9% through 2025, which is at the high end of growth projections for U.S. utilities. We expect the earnings from these core businesses to grow in line with the rate base.\nTurning to Slide 10 for an update on AES Next. We are developing and incubating new products and business platforms through AES Next. Our investments in AES next help our businesses to be more innovative and competitive and drive value for our customers and shareholders. We are proud that earlier this year, Fast Company named AES as one of the 10 most innovative energy companies in the world and the only large publicly-traded company to be included on that list.\nTurning to Slide 11. The most mature initiative under AES Next today is Fluence, which as of December 31, had 4.2 gigawatts of energy storage products deployed and contracted and a signed backlog of $1.9 billion.\nAdditionally, Fluence's digital platform, Fluence IQ, recently acquired Nispera, and now has a combined 15 gigawatts contracted or under management, of which more than 80% is with third-party customers.\nOver the past several months, Fluence has been dealing with short-term challenges mostly stemming from COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Their management team has taken proactive steps to address these challenges, including diversifying battery suppliers signing new shipping agreements, building out their in-house supply chain team and regionalizing their manufacturing.\nOverall, demand for energy storage remains very robust, and Fluence is well capitalized and positioned to grow as a market leader. We see a pathway for them to improve their margins and grow as the global energy transition continues to progress.\nFinally, turning to our strategic outlook for the sector, beginning on Slide 12. Our goal is to be the leader in providing low carbon energy solutions while delivering annualized earnings and cash flow growth of 7% to 9% through 2025. Today, there is an unprecedented transformation of our sector underway with governments, utilities and companies working to shift to low carbon sources of power.\nFor example, just looking at the public commitment of the RE100, a group of over 350 large corporations who have committed to 100% renewable energy, we expect our annual demand to more than double to almost 400 terawatt hours of renewable energy by 2030. Facing this immense opportunity we are taking steps to ensure our continued competitive advantage in this once in a generation transformation of our sector.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, this transformation is reflected in our own portfolio as we expect renewables to represent more than 3/4 of our installed capacity by the end of 2025.\nDuring that same time period, we expect our renewables business to nearly triple from 13 gigawatts to approximately 38 gigawatts and our capacity from coal to go from 7 gigawatts to 0.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results 2022 parent capital allocation and 2022 guidance.\nBeginning on Slide 15, as Andrés highlighted, I'm very pleased to share that Moody's recently completed a thorough review of our consolidated debt and cash flow across our businesses and upgraded AES to investment grade. This conclusion further validates our year's long effort to reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet and will yield further benefits as we grow our business and attract new investors to AES.\nAs an investment-grade rated company, we will continue to lead the renewable sector while growing our U.S. utility asset base and our long-term contracted generation portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 16 and the resiliency of our business model. Today, 85% of our adjusted PTC is from long-term contracted generation and utilities. We are largely insulated from the current macroeconomic volatility affecting commodity prices, inflation, interest rates and foreign currencies, with the vast majority of our portfolio benefiting from contractual indexation, fuel pass-through or hedging programs that limit our exposure.\nCombined, these macroeconomic factors had an impact of less than $2 million on our adjusted PTC in the first quarter.\nFor the full year, we currently expect a net positive contribution from these macroeconomic factors as a result of higher natural gas prices and higher power prices in some of our markets.\nNow turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 17. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.21 versus $0.28 last year. Our core business segments grew by $0.04 over the first quarter of 2021. These positive contributions were offset by several negative drivers we had already anticipated in our 2022 guidance.\nFirst, higher losses at AES Next, primarily resulting from COVID-related supply chain issues at Fluence in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAs a reminder, we report Fluence's results on a 1 quarter lag. So the Fluence results relate to their December quarter end, which was disclosed in February and included in AES' full year guidance on our last call.\nSecond, the higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment we made for our equity units.\nThird, a higher quarterly effective tax rate than our overall expectation for the full year due to timing.\nAnd finally, nonrecurring gains on interest rate hedges recorded last year, which skewed the quarter over prior year quarter comparison.\nTurning to Slide 18. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $207 million for the quarter, which was $40 million lower than 2021, consistent with the drivers I just discussed. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides.\nIn the U.S. and utility strategic business unit, or SBU, higher PTC was driven primarily by earnings from new renewables coming online and higher contributions from Southland, partially offset by higher spend at AES Clean Energy due to an accelerated growth plan.\nHigher PTC at our South America SBU was mostly driven by our increased ownership of AES Andy's and higher contracted revenue in Colombia. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC SBU primarily reflects the sale of Itabo in the Dominican Republic in 2021 and lower availability at our generation facilities in Mexico.\nFinally, in Eurasia, higher PTC reflects higher revenue at our Mong Duong facility in Vietnam and higher power prices at our wind plant in Bulgaria, driven by commodity price increases.\nNow to Slide 23. We are on track to achieve our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65. Our typical quarterly earnings profile is more heavily weighted towards Q3 and Q4, with about 2/3 of our earnings occurring in the second half of the year. We continue to expect a similar profile this year as we grow more in the U.S. where earnings are higher in the second half of the year based on solar generation profiles, utility demand seasonality and the commissioning of more new projects in the third and fourth quarters.\nGrowth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, including over 2 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online over the next 9 months, as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES AMS's. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025, based on our expected growth in renewables and U.S. utilities as well as the recycling of our capital into additional investment opportunities we see across our global portfolio.\nNow to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24. Sources reflect approximately $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of total discretionary cash, including $900 million of parent free cash flow and $500 million to $700 million of proceeds from asset sales.\nOn the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the 5% increase we announced in December and the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion in our subsidiaries as we capitalize on attractive opportunities for growth.\nNearly half of these investments are in renewables, reflecting our success in securing long-term contracts during 2021 and our expectations for 2022.\nAbout 25% of these investments are in our U.S. utilities, to fund rate base growth with a continued focus on grid and fleet modernization.\nIn summary, close to 3/4 of our investments this year are going to renewables growth in our U.S. utilities businesses helping us to achieve our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to more than half by 2023.\nIn fact, we have made great progress on our growth investments so far this year with approximately $650 million already invested primarily in renewables and to increase our ownership in AES Andres. We will continue to allocate our capital in line with our strategy to lead the renewable sector, further anchor AES in the U.S. market and to decarbonize our portfolio.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. In summary, our core business continues to perform well. We have attained investment-grade ratings from all 3 major agencies. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance and annualized growth through 2025. We continue to deliver on our commitments, including our 2022 construction projects, which we expect to commission on time even with the ongoing Department of Commerce investigation into solar panel imports. We are energized by the immense opportunity for growth in our business and remain committed to maintaining our competitive advantage.\nWith that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

My name is Bailey, and I will be the moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to pass the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Global Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Ahmed, please go ahead.\n\nAhmed Pasha\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation.\nJoining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres?\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial review call. Today, I will cover our full year results and discuss our strategy and areas of focus for this year. Before discussing our 2021 results and future plans, I want to state that we do not see any significant impact on our portfolio from the outbreak of hostility in the Ukraine. Nonetheless, our thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people and government, and we hope for a speedy return to peace.\nNow turning our focus back to our business. Today marks an important and exciting milestone for AES with the announcement of our intention to fully exit coal by year-end 2025. This accelerated goal is a result of our success in growing our renewables portfolio. And our backlog gives us the confidence to take this step.\nAs a leader in the global energy transition, we are committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement in achieving a net zero economy. We will work with our stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition While meeting our regulatory obligations.\nOur exit from coal will be modestly dilutive, but we feel comfortable with our growth trajectory. And accordingly, we are reaffirming Our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% in earnings and cash flow through 2025.\nNow moving on to our 2021 results and accomplishments. First, I am pleased to report our financial results, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, which was in line with our expectations. Our 2021 parent free cash flow of $839 million exceeded our expected range of $775 million to $825 million.\nSecond, we signed contracts for 5 gigawatts of new renewable projects, significantly above our target of 3 to 4 gigawatts that we set last year. In fact, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, AES signed more renewable deals with corporate customers in 2021 than anyone else in the world. Included in these deals were 2 groundbreaking arrangements to provide renewable energy on an hour-by-hour basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week signed with Google and Microsoft.\nThird, Fluent successfully completed their IPO in November and have no foreseeable need for external funding to achieve their strategic and financial objectives. Furthermore, Fluence has made progress towards mitigating the supply chain challenges they have faced, which I shall discuss shortly.\nFinally, safety is our most important value. I am very proud to report that our safety performance in 2021 was the best in our 40-year history, with no major incidents recorded among roughly 25,000 AES people, contractors and construction workers.\nToday, I will be discussing 2 things: first, executing today; and second, investing for the future. Beginning with executing today on Slide 4. Even as we are transitioning to a carbon-free future, we are laser-focused on delivering on our commitments. Our business model has proven itself to be resilient and enables us to deliver predictable results. For example, 85% of our adjusted PTC is from long-term contracted generation and utilities and 88% is in U.S. dollars, with the remaining 12% split between euros and various Latin American currencies. Similarly, we're largely insulated from macroeconomic headwinds, such as rising inflation and interest rates.\nAs shown on Slide 5, 83% of our revenue is from businesses that have indexation clauses or or hedged to limit the impact from inflation. At the same time, almost 90% of our interest rate exposure is fixed or hedged, protecting us from the impact of rising interest rates.\nNext, turning to Slide 6. In January, we completed a tender required the publicly-traded shares of AES Andes, bringing our ownership from 67% to 99% today. This was motivated by our conviction in the underlying strength of the business, which is highly contracted, predominantly in U.S. dollars and transitioning to low-carbon generation. This transaction is immediately earnings and cash flow accretive.\nMoving to Slide 7. We now have a backlog of 9.2 gigawatts, including the 5 gigawatts we signed in 2021. About 3/4 of the 5 gigawatts is in the U.S., with the vast majority signed with C&I customers and to grow the rate base at our AES Indiana utility. We have secured supply arrangements for the bulk of our current backlog. In 2021, we successfully added 2.1 gigawatts to our portfolio without any material delays or cost overrun. This execution demonstrates the robust nature of our supply chain and the strength of our relationships with our suppliers. For example, we secured Sampson battery for many of our new energy storage facilities to alleviate some of the supply chain challenges faced by Fluence. Being able to switch to different battery suppliers shows the inherent flexibility of their Gen 6 product.\nAs we look towards our 2.3 gigawatts of new projects coming online in 2022, 2/3 of which is in the U.S., we do not expect any significant delays or supply chain disruptions. We remain confident in our ability to complete our projects under construction on time and on budget.\nMoving to our second theme, investing for the future on Slide 8. Our actions today ensure that we will be able to take full advantage of the unprecedented transformation of our sector. One clear example is the 5 gigawatts of new PPAs that we signed last year, an increase of 65% from 2020. For full year '22, we expect to sign 4.5 to 5.5 gigawatts of new renewables under long-term contracts. We are seeing strong demand for renewables. And so far this year, we have already signed more than 600 megawatts of new contracts. We expect our portfolio of operating renewable assets to more than double from approximately 13 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts by 2026.\nDespite any current headwind for our sector, such as delays in legislation and supply chain issues, we see very strong demand for low-carbon energy, especially for tailored products, such as our 24/7 renewable offering. That is why we have been investing in growing our pipeline of future projects to ensure that we're able to meet our customers' growing demand for AES services.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, we now have a development pipeline of 59 gigawatts, which we believe is the second largest among U.S. renewable developers. Our pipeline includes almost 10 gigawatts in the U.S. that are ready to bid. This robust pipeline provides us with the projects we need to deliver on our backlog and to continue to build on our competitive position in the U.S. As a result, we're accelerating our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings coming from our U.S. businesses to 50% by 2 years from 2025 to 2023.\nWe are also investing for the future by growing the rate base at our U.S. utilities by 9% annually while delivering safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers. As you can see on Slide 10, AES Indiana is executing on the approved plan to retire 2 coal units, which we will replace with nearly 500 megawatts of new renewable generation. We have already started our next integrated resource plan process, which could include additional retirement or fuel conversion for the remaining 1 gigawatt of coal generation.\nAt AES Ohio, we're executing on our smart grid and transmission investment programs approved in 2021. AES Ohio is also in the midst of a distribution rate case and recently completed the hearing. AES Ohio's base distribution rates have been the lowest in the state for the past 5 years. In fact, as of the end of 2021 AES Ohio's rates were 16% lower than the next lowest utility in the state and even with the requested rate increase would remain the lowest.\nTurning to Slide 11. Another way we're investing for the future is by developing and incubating new products and businesses' platforms through AES Next. Our investment in AES Next help our core businesses be more innovative and competitive and drive value for our customers and shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 12. The most mature initiative under AES Next today is Fluence, the leading energy storage technology company. In 2021, Fluence completed their IPO with $1 billion in capital raised to invest in developing their products and supply chain as well as their digital platform. As of December 31, Fluence had 4.2 gigawatts of energy storage products deployed and contracted and a signed backlog of $1.9 billion.\nAdditionally, Fluence's digital platform, Fluence IQ, now has 6 gigawatts contracted, of which more than 80% is with third-party customers. Over the past several months, Fluence has been dealing with short-term challenges stemming from COVID-19-related supply chain issues. Their management team has taken proactive actions to address these challenges, including diversifying battery suppliers' signing and shipping agreements and building out their in-house supply chain team. Overall, demand for energy storage remains robust, and Fluence is well positioned as a market leader. We see significant opportunity for them to continue to grow and remain confident that they will execute on their long-term plan, which will deliver value to their shareholders.\nAES Next is also working to develop and incubate other technologies that help accelerate the deployment of renewables, as shown on Slide 13. One example is our investment in 5D, which has a prefabricated solar solution called Maverick that is hurricane wind-resistant and allows projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on 1/2 as much land. This innovative product is currently being rolled out in Australia, Chile, the Dominican Republic, India, Panama and the U.S.\nTurning to Slide 14. We're one of a small number of company in our sector with targets that are fully aligned with the Paris Agreement according to the transition pathways initiative. We already have a goal to have net zero emissions from electricity by 2040. And as I mentioned earlier, we're excited to announce our intent to exit coal completely by the end of 2025, subject to receiving necessary approvals. We expect to achieve this objective through a combination of retirement, fuel conversions and asset sales.\nIn summary, we have consolidated our position as a leader of innovation in the industry and accelerated the decarbonization of our portfolio while delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.\nWith that, I now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover the following key topics: our financial performance during 2021, our parent capital allocation and our 2022 guidance and expectations through 2025.\nAs Andres mentioned, our results for 2021 show our continued progress in leading the energy transition while achieving our financial goals. We delivered strong financial results even while absorbing the previously discussed impact from the share count adjustment related to the equity units issued last year. Overall, the strong growth of our core energy business, which includes generation and utilities gives us confidence that we will continue to achieve our earnings and cash flow target.\nTurning to Slide 16. Full year 2021 adjusted EPS was $1.52, $0.08 higher than 2020. 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.44 included $0.03 of dilution from AES Next, implying that our core business generated adjusted EPS of $1.47. In 2021, our core business grew by $0.21 to $1.68, primarily as a result of higher contributions from new renewables businesses, improved operations at both U.S. generation and MCAC and lower parent interest. Our 2021 results of $1.52 include the $0.07 impact due to a higher share count as a result of the accounting adjustment for the equity unit and the dilution from AES Next where we are investing in expanding our high-growth technology businesses.\nThe impact from ASX Next was $0.03 higher than our prior expectation due to the nonrecurring COVID-related supply chain issues at Fluence. Going forward, we plan to manage the AES Next portfolio such that these businesses will yield a neutral to positive contribution to AES earnings by 2024.\nTurning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.4 billion for the year, an increase of $171 million and 14% growth over 2020. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the U.S. and Utilities SBU on Slide 18. Our increased investments in the U.S. show PTC growth of $155 million, a 31% increase over 2020. As of year-end 2021, the U.S. represented 41% of our adjusted PTC, up from 34% in 2020. About half of this growth was driven by new businesses at AES Clean Energy that came online in 2021. And the rest of the increase was from our legacy Southland units, which remained a key contributor to the stability of the California grid during the peak summer season and delivered solid growth from increased dispatch and attractive market prices. We continue to see the potential for some of our legacy Southland units to support the energy transition in California for several years to come.\nLower PTC at our South America SBU was primarily driven by regulatory adjustments and recovery of expenses from customers that were recorded in 2020. Hydrology was not a major driver as we benefited from the increased diversity of our generation portfolio and favorable hydrological conditions in Colombia offset drier conditions in Brazil. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects higher LNG sales in both Panama and the Dominican Republic as we benefited from higher contract levels at our LNG terminals. We now have roughly 80% of our LNG capacity contracted, leaving approximately $20 million to $30 million of potential annual upside to our longer-term expectations.\nFinally, in Eurasia, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from Bulgaria due to improved operating performance at Marissa and increased revenue at our wind farm, which benefited from favorable market prices.\nNow let's turn to review of how we allocated our capital in 2021 on Slide 22. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $2.3 billion of total discretionary cash. And I'm pleased to report that this includes parent free cash flow of $839 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance expectations. The remaining sources are largely in line with our prior disclosures except the $295 million in temporary drawing under our revolver, which we utilized to fund our accelerating growth in clean energy.\nMoving to the uses on the right-hand side. We allocated $450 million of our discretionary cash to our dividend. We invested nearly $1.8 billion in our subsidiaries, of which approximately 2/3 was in the U.S. As Andres mentioned, we expect the relative share of our allocation for the U.S. to continue to grow. And I'm glad to report that we now expect to reach our goal of 50% of our earnings coming from the U.S. in 2023, 2 years earlier than our previous target in 2025.\nNow turning to our credit profile on Slide 23. As a result of the successful execution of our strategy over the last few years, our balance sheet continues to be in a much stronger position. We significantly reduced debt while growing our parent free cash flow. At the end of 2021, our parent free cash flow to net debt ratio was approximately 23%, which is well above the 20% threshold required for an investment-grade rating. We expect this ratio to continue to improve over time putting us in BBB territory by 2025. We are in active discussions with Moody's and remain optimistic that we will be upgraded this year.\nTurning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% in both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2025 off a base year of 2020. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2022 adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Key drivers of our expected growth include the approximate $0.09 benefit from our higher ownership of AES Andes, which we increased to 99%, as Andres mentioned earlier. This transaction is immediately significantly accretive on both an earnings and cash flow basis. And with a simplified shareholder base, AES Andes will be able to more efficiently execute on its substantial renewables pipeline.\nOur adjusted -- our 2022 adjusted EPS will also benefit from continued growth in renewables and higher contributions from existing operations, adding $0.10. This growth is expected to be partially offset by $0.11 of impacts from the higher adjusted tax rate, a full year of a higher share count due to the accounting adjustment for the equity units issued in 2021 and assumed dilution from planned asset sales. Our target for this year has increased to reflect our efforts to further decarbonize and fully exit coal by the end of 2025. I would also note that we previously expected the pending distribution rate case of DPL to be resolved earlier in the year. However, we now expect resolution later this year and, therefore, have assumed only a small contribution in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow for 2022 is expected to be $860 million to $910 million, in line with our annualized growth target of 7% to 9%.\nNow turning to our 2022 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 26. Beginning with approximately $1.5 billion of sources on the left-hand side, in addition to parent free cash flow, we expect to generate $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds. Roughly half of this is from already announced sales i Vietnam and Jordan, and the remaining portion is expected to come from additional asset sales that have not yet been announced. Recycling of capital is an integral part of our capital allocation framework. And as we have done in the past, we will deploy asset sale proceeds to achieve our strategic objectives and maximize shareholder value.\nNow to the uses on the right-hand side. We expect to allocate $494 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects our announced 5% increase. We are also projecting investments of roughly $1 billion in our subsidiaries for growth, of which about 3/4 will be allocated to the U.S. to renewables and utilities.\nFinally, turning to our 4-year capital allocation plan through 2025 beginning on Slide 27. Our financial strategy is centered around maintaining a strong investment-grade rated balance sheet while investing in our growth to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. Our total growth investments for 2022 through 2025 have increased to $3.8 billion. We expect to continue to increase our dividend 4% to 6% annually, in line with our prior guidance.\nAs you can see on Slide 28, we plan to fund this $6 billion with 60% parent free cash flow and the remaining 40% will be from asset sale proceeds and future parent debt issuances. Relative to our prior plan, you may notice that we have increased asset sale proceeds by $500 million and future parent debt by $300 million, which will be utilized to fund our future growth and repay drawings on our revolver that funded the higher growth from 2021.\nIn summary, we accelerated AES growth in 2021 and executed on our financial and strategic commitments. Going forward, we will continue to deliver on our strategy, including executing on asset sales to decarbonize and exit coal, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and allocating capital to maximize per share value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. As you can see, we're not only delivering on our commitments, but accelerating our transformation. Our near-term actions will enable us to achieve our 3 goals for creating additional shareholder value: first, attending an investment-grade rating from Moody's in 2022; second, increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to 50% by 2023; and third, exiting coal generation by the end of 2025.\nWith that, I'd like to open up the call to questions."

My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Susan, you may begin.\n\nSusan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt\n\nVP of IR, The AES Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; Ricardo Falu, our Chief Operating Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial review call. Today, I will cover our 2024 accomplishments, the resiliency of our business, and our 2025 guidance and longer-term outlook. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will provide more details on our financial performance and expectations after my remarks.\nTo say that we are extremely disappointed with our stock price performance is an understatement. Steve and I will address what we believe to be investors' concerns, including policy uncertainties, renewables EBITDA growth and balance sheet and funding constraints. We will review why renewables are critical to meeting growing demand for electricity, particularly among technology customers, and why our business model is relatively well insulated from and resilient to potential regulatory changes.\nEven with our resilient position, we are taking immediate steps to strengthen our financial position and outlook. These steps include: reducing our current investment in renewables by focusing on the highest risk-adjusted return projects, improving organizational efficiency and continuing to operate some of our energy infrastructure assets. As a result of these actions, we expect to improve our credit metrics over time while eliminating the need for issuing new equity during the forecast period and maintaining our dividend.\nTurning to Slide 4. Let me start with our 2024 results. We signed 4.4 gigawatts of new power purchase agreements for renewables last year. Our performance in 2024 puts us on track to achieve our goal of signing 14 to 17 gigawatts of new PPAs through 2025. We are prioritizing signing those contracts with the best risk-adjusted returns rather than just maximizing growth in gigawatts. In 2024, we also completed the construction or acquisition of 3 gigawatts of renewables and a 670-megawatt combined cycle gas plant in Panama, greatly increasing the utilization of our existing LNG terminal in that country.\nOur best-in-class record of on-time and on-budget delivery of renewable projects is something that our customers value highly and is one of our competitive advantages. Lastly, I should note that in 2024, we received approval from the Indiana Regulatory Commission for new base rates and an ROE of 9.9%, supporting an investment program that will improve reliability for our customers and support local economic development.\nNow moving to our financial results. In 2024, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $2.64 billion, which is in the lower half of our guidance range as a result of extreme onetime weather-related events in Colombia and Brazil, with both businesses down a combined $200 million year-on-year. Nonetheless, we generated parent free cash flow of $1.1 billion, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And we earned a record adjusted EPS of $2.14, which is materially above our guidance range and puts us well on track to achieve our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% from 2020 to 2025.\nMoving to our renewables business on Slide 5. 2025 will be an inflection point as we begin to realize the financial benefits from the maturing of our renewable business, including the addition of 6.6 gigawatts we inaugurated in 2023 and 2024. We were able to achieve increasing economies of scale that reduce our overhead per megawatt as we now have 16.2 gigawatts of renewables online versus 5.9 gigawatts in 2018, excluding Brazil. At the same time, our development business is becoming more efficient as we are now harvesting the investments we've made in creating our pipeline.\nFurthermore, as profitability of each megawatt of new PPA signed has substantially increased, we do not need to bring online as many new projects to achieve the same level of financial growth. This strategy allows us to focus on the most profitable new projects while reducing costs and capital requirements as I will shortly discuss. There is a time lag between renewables development expenditures, which flow through the P&L and growth in EBITDA.\nCreating a pipeline of potential projects requires expenditures in development activities such as scouting for prospects, negotiating land purchases or leases, measuring the wind or sun resource and finally, obtaining permits. As our renewables are in a more mature state, our financials will start to reflect the true profitability of the business as new projects coming online, producing cash and EBITDA, cover the cost of early-stage projects. As the business grows, stewardship, including administrative and back-office activities will get allocated over a larger operating base. This inflection in our life cycle, starting in 2025, will strengthen our credit metrics as we achieve a higher ratio of projects online, selling energy versus spending on pipeline and projects under construction.\nWith this background, let me turn to our financial expectations for our renewables business. In 2025, we expect over 60% year-over-year growth in our renewables EBITDA, which Steve will discuss in more detail. Previous growth in our U.S. renewables portfolio drives the majority of our expected EBITDA growth. And in 2025, we expect to bring online another 3.2 gigawatts of renewable capacity, which will contribute to strong EBITDA growth in 2026 and beyond. These numbers also reflect the maturing of our U.S. renewables business as we harvest the investments we made to create our 50-gigawatt U.S. pipeline.\nFinally, I should note that our 2025 renewables segment guidance incorporates some changes in segment makeup, including the sale of 5.2 gigawatts in Brazil last year and the addition of 2.5 gigawatts in Chile. As the business has evolved, these Chilean renewable assets have now been moved from the energy infrastructure SBU to the renewables SBU. The sale of Brazil is an important derisking of our portfolio as we have eliminated a significant portion of our hydrology, currency, spot price, and floating interest rate risk exposures.\nTurning to Slide 6 and the renewables market and our business. Last year, the U.S. added 49 gigawatts of new capacity with renewables and battery storage representing 92% of those additions. In 2025, the U.S. is expected to add 63 gigawatts, 93% of which are solar, storage and wind. Where we will likely see a surge for new gas capacity over the next decade, the delay in delivery of new gas turbine averages 3 to 4 years without taking into account new permitting requirements or building new gas pipelines. While a few decommissioned nuclear units are expected to be brought online in the next 5 years, a material contribution in new capacity from small nuclear reactors or advanced design nuclear plants is unlikely to occur for at least another decade.\nTaking all this into consideration, renewables have the shortest time to power and much greater price certainty. Therefore, there is no doubt that the increased demand for electricity over the next decade coming from data centers and advanced manufacturing will continue to require vast amounts of renewable energy and batteries.\nMoving to Slide 7. Over the past 5 years, we have endeavored to make our business resilient to potential policy changes. First, we have taken a lead in onshoring our supply chain to the U.S., which limits our exposure to new tariffs. We now have essentially all of our solar panels, trackers and batteries either in-country or contracted to be domestically produced for our U.S. projects coming online through 2027. Second, of the 8.4 gigawatts of signed contracts we have in the U.S., more than half are under construction and nearly all have significant safe harbor protections, which will grandfather them under the existing tax policy regime.\nThird, about 3 gigawatts or 30% of our backlog of signed PPAs are in U.S. dollars but in international markets, primarily Chile, which are unaffected by U.S. policy changes. I should note that in our international markets, renewables can be even more profitable and most often, the cheapest form of dispatchable energy even in a regime without meaningful subsidies. Lastly, the vast majority of AES's customer base are corporations whose demand for new renewables continues to increase at a rapid pace. In fact, in 2024, approximately 70% of the PPAs we signed were with large corporations. And notably, we have once again been designated by BNEF as the largest provider of clean energy to corporations in the world.\nEven in the very unlikely scenario where tax credits for renewables are eliminated prospectively in their entirety, we believe that there will be continued strong demand from our corporate clients, especially data centers, because there are no realistic alternatives for many years. Without timely access to power, there can be no AI revolution. Obviously, the price of new PPAs in a future without tax incentives would increase, and the profile of earnings and cash flow would change. This will look a lot like our projects in Chile. However, in any case, what ultimately matters to AES is our returns and cash flow per dollar invested.\nNow let me turn to our utilities business on Slide 8. AES Indiana and AES Ohio are executing on a multiyear investment program to improve customer reliability and support economic development. In 2024, we invested $1.6 billion, leading to a rate base growth of 20%. This investment program includes growth and modernization programs at both of our utilities and a plan to transition our aging coal generation in Indiana. Our investment plans are driven by our customers, and our top priority is to support local communities with reliable, resilient and affordable power. We have among the lowest residential rates in both states, which we expect to maintain even as we grow our rate base.\nTurning to Slide 9. Across our 2 utilities, we have growth riders or trackers which yield near real-time returns on our investments. More than 70% of the investment program is recovered through formula rates or existing riders as through the TDSIC program at AES Indiana or the FERC formula rates that support transmission investment at AES Ohio. All of this, combined with signed agreements for over 2 gigawatts of new data center demand, make AES Indiana and AES Ohio among the fastest growing and modernizing utilities in the nation. From 2023 to 2027, we expect annualized growth in our rate base of at least 11% across 2 utilities. This plan will support credit improvement at TPL Inc., which we expect to achieve investment-grade metrics by 2026.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Our energy infrastructure business provides a substantial and steady base of earnings and cash flow that support our credit ratings and help fund our dividends and new growth. We remain committed to an all-of-the-above strategy, which includes an important role for gas in our businesses and customer offerings. During the fourth quarter, we completed the construction of a new 670-megawatt fully contracted in dollars CCGT in Panama, which will result in much greater utilization of our existing LNG regasification and storage tanks in the country.\nIn addition, we're delaying the closure or sale of a few of our coal plants as a result of increased demand in those markets. These assets are largely depreciated yet contribute meaningful EBITDA and cash flow. We still remain committed, nonetheless, to a full exit from coal generation and will continue to rapidly lower our carbon intensity and minimize carbon emissions from our generation fleet.\nNow moving to our financial outlook on Slide 11. Today, we are initiating our 2025 guidance, including adjusted EBITDA of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion, parent free cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.26. We're also reaffirming all of our long-term growth rates, including 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth through 2027. As we grow, we're also improving our business mix as we see a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA from renewables and U.S. utilities.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and plans to improve our credit ratios through and beyond our guidance period on Slide 12. We are firmly committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as well as our dividend. As a result, we're taking several actions to improve cash flow and reduce parent equity requirements while ensuring that our capital plan will be totally self-funded.\nI should note that these efforts are ongoing and we will continue to evaluate measures to strengthen our financial position on top of what's already included in our guidance. First, we have resized our development program and organization to focus on executing on our backlog and pursuing fewer but larger projects to better serve our core customers. This strategy allows us to increase our returns on our available capital by selecting the most attractive projects. Given the strength of our 50-gigawatt U.S. pipeline, we also expect to execute more development transfer agreements, enabling us to monetize a portion of our renewables pipeline without requiring significant AES equity. As a result of all of these actions, we have reduced our parent investment in the renewables business by $1.3 billion from now through 2027 and eliminated the need for equity.\nSecond, we are streamlining our organization ahead of what was originally planned. Our business is significantly simpler today than it was 10 years ago. As we now operate in fewer countries, our portfolio consists of more than 50% renewables, and our growth is primarily concentrated in the U.S. In 2025, after the execution of this restructuring, we will realize approximately $150 million in cost savings, ramping up to over $300 million in 2026 as we achieve a full year run rate.\nThird, as I previously mentioned, we will retain a few of our coal assets beyond 2027 to support our financial metrics and fund new projects. Taken together, these actions enable an even stronger AES with a clear path to achieve our 2025 and long-term financial commitments and strength in our credit metrics.\nIn summary, we have a resilient strategy to deliver on our financial commitments regardless of regulatory outcomes. We have continued to derisk our business by exiting Brazil, locking in and onshoring our equipment, and moving our supply chain to the U.S. As I mentioned earlier, 2025 is an inflection point for the financial results of our U.S. renewables business as we begin to harvest many years of work and investments. Demand from our core corporate clients remains strong and growing, and we are taking all steps to increase our efficiency and profitability. We are confident in the underlying value of our business, and we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet while capitalizing on our unique competitive advantages. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Coughlin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2024 results and capital allocation, our 2025 guidance and our updated expectations through 2027. Turning to Slide 14. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $2.64 billion versus $2.8 billion in 2023, driven primarily by record-breaking drought conditions in South America, several forced outages and asset sales but partially offset by contributions from new renewables projects.\nTurning to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS was $2.14 in 2024 versus $1.76 in 2023. Drivers were similar to those for adjusted EBITDA but also include significantly higher tax attributes on new renewables commissionings and a lower adjusted tax rate. This tax benefit was associated with our transition to a simpler, more U.S.-oriented holding company structure better aligned with our growth. This is partially offset by a $0.07 headwind from parent interest on higher debt balances primarily used to fund new renewables projects. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the renewables strategic business unit, or SBU, on Slide 16.\nLower adjusted EBITDA at a renewables SBU was primarily driven by historic weather volatility in South America. In the second quarter, an unprecedented flood forced an outage at our Chivor facility for nearly 2 months, which was then followed by a record-breaking drought across the country. Brazil was also impacted by a lengthy drought and extremely low wind resource, and a sale closing in the fourth quarter reduced EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. These negative drivers were partially offset by contributions from new projects that came online primarily in the U.S.\nAt our Utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was primarily driven by rate base investment in the U.S., new rates at AES Indiana and improved weather but partially offset by the 2023 recovery of purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP 4 settlement as well as higher interest expense from new borrowings. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU reflects an outage in Mexico, lower margins at Southland and sell-downs in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Finally, at our New Energy Technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects improved results at Fluence.\nNow let's turn to how we allocated our capital last year on Slide 20. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $3.1 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of just over $1.1 billion, which increased more than 10% from the prior year. We distributed nearly $600 million of asset sales proceeds to the AES parent, and we issued $1.4 billion of hybrid parent debt. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. We invested approximately $1.9 billion in growth at our subsidiaries, of which more than 80% was allocated toward our renewables and utilities businesses. We also repaid roughly $180 million of subsidiary debt and allocated $500 million of discretionary cash to our dividend. In addition, we used a portion of December hybrid issuance proceeds to repay parent debt and have ended the year with a significant cash balance that will go toward executing on our backlog in 2025.\nNow turning to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 21. Today, we're initiating 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion, in which growth in our core businesses is offsetting a number of onetime year-over-year headwinds. Our guidance includes more than $300 million of growth at our renewables and utilities SBUs. This is partially offset by the sale of AES Brazil and the pending 30% sale of AES Ohio as well as approximately $200 million from a reduction in Southland margins related to declining power prices in California and the retirement of our Warrior Run coal plant in energy infrastructure where we recognized revenues in the first half of 2024 related to the monetization of the PPA.\nThe timing of these 2024 items, combined with the seasonality of our renewables growth will result in our first half EBITDA being lower on a year-over-year basis while the second half will be significantly higher. In addition to these drivers, we also expect to realize $150 million of cost savings in 2025 across all businesses from the actions we are taking that Andrés outlined. Looking beyond this year, these savings, which increase to a run rate of over $300 million in 2026, combined with continued growth in renewables and utilities will accelerate the growth trajectory of AES. As a result, we now expect a much higher low-teens EBITDA growth rate in 2026 versus 2025.\nIn addition, we expect to recognize $1.4 billion of tax attributes in 2025. This represents an increase of nearly $100 million driven by more projects coming online in the U.S. In total, we expect to achieve $3.95 billion to $4.35 billion of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes in 2025.\nTurning to Slide 22. I will now provide some additional color on our renewables SBU adjusted EBITDA, which we expect to increase significantly year-over-year in 2025. This growth includes more than $150 million from new projects, much of which relate to the 6.6 gigawatts of new capacity we placed in service in late 2023 and throughout 2024. These projects are already online and operating and will now contribute a full year of EBITDA in 2025.\nThe sale of AES Brazil in the fourth quarter of last year will serve as a $100 million headwind year-over-year but is more than offset by the resegmenting and growth of our renewables business in Chile, which is forecasted to be close to $190 million in 2025. The last 2 drivers are the normalization of Colombia results after the second quarter flood-driven outage and historic drought conditions in 2024, and the impact of resizing our development business, as Andrés previously discussed.\nTurning to Slide 23. We are initiating 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.10 to $2.26, and we expect to achieve the upper half of the 7% to 9% long-term growth target we initiated in 2021. Drivers are similar to adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but will be offset by higher parent interest and a higher adjusted tax rate. As a reminder, our results have historically been somewhat seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year and this year is no exception.\nNow turning to our 2025 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24, beginning with approximately $2.7 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2025 is expected to be around $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. We expect to generate $400 million to $500 million of net asset sale proceeds this year and issue an additional $700 million of net new parent debt. Now to the uses on the right-hand side, we plan to invest approximately $1.8 billion in new growth, of which more than 85% will be in the U.S. We also plan to repay roughly $400 million of subsidiary debt and allocate more than $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 2% increase.\nTurning to Slide 25 and our long-term expectations. We expect tremendous growth at our renewables SBU with an average annual CAGR of 19% to 21% expected from our 2023 guidance midpoint. This will be primarily driven by 6.6 gigawatts of new projects already placed in service along with roughly $700 million of new EBITDA from bringing the majority of our 11.9 gigawatt backlog online. Also included is the addition of Chile renewables offset by the sale of AES Brazil, neither of which were contemplated in our 2023 SBU guidance ranges.\nAt our utilities SBU, we expect annualized growth of 13% to 15% through 2027, reflecting upside from new data center development in our service territories that could serve as an even greater tailwind beyond 2027. This growth is largely covered by trackers and will be critical to improving service quality and reliability for our customers. Our utilities plan also incorporates the 30% sell-down of AES Ohio we expect to close in the first half of this year. This will reduce adjusted EBITDA in the near term but allows us to fully capture the data center opportunity in the long term and maximize shareholder value.\nIn our energy infrastructure SBU, we now expect EBITDA contributions will decline at a slower rate than in our prior guidance as we plan to operate a few coal plants beyond our previously planned 2027 exit, improving earnings and cash flow.\nNow to Slide 26. Bringing it all together, I am pleased to reaffirm our long-term adjusted EBITDA growth target of 5% to 7% and our long-term parent free cash flow growth target of 6% to 8% through 2027. This growth is largely locked in through signed PPAs for our backlog projects and approved or tracked rate base investment at our utilities.\nTurning to Slide 27 and our long-term capital plan. Total sources of $6 billion will be funded primarily with parent free cash of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, reflecting average annual growth of 6% to 8% off our 2023 guidance midpoints. We also expect to issue $900 million to $1 billion of net new parent debt and realize $800 million to $1.2 billion of proceeds from asset sales. It is important to note here that we have fully removed any need for equity issuance throughout our guidance period.\nOn the right-hand side, parent investment of approximately $4 billion reflects our reduced investment in renewables. We also plan to repay $600 million of subsidiary debt. We expect to allocate another $1.6 billion of cash to our dividend, which we are fully committed to maintaining at its current level. However, given our efforts to minimize parent cash needs in the already highly attractive yield, we do not expect to grow the dividend during our planned period.\nOur long-term guidance includes the impact of the actions we're taking to simplify our operations, reduce spending on development and further increase our cash flow and strengthen our credit metrics. These include reducing our planned renewables investments by $1.3 billion, implementing a restructuring program to generate over $300 million of run rate cost savings by 2026 and continuing to operate select coal assets with earnings and cash potential beyond 2027. These actions demonstrate our commitment to our financial targets as well as our investment-grade credit ratings.\nI want to briefly make a few points about our capital structure and financing model. While we see an uptick in our total debt levels by the end of 2027, which should be looked at on an ownership-adjusted basis, our actions to reduce costs and focus our development efforts on higher returning projects will increase cash flows and improve our credit metrics. This eliminates any need for new equity and gives us more flexibility on timing to execute asset sales and sell-downs. Approximately 20% of our debt is related to projects still under construction that are not yet yielding EBITDA or cash. And more than half of this amount will be permanently taken out by monetizing tax attributes when projects are placed in service, leading to a significantly lower level of long-term project debt.\nGiven that we carry this construction debt, it is relevant to consider a pro forma view of the annual EBITDA and cash generation that will recur once construction is complete. To be specific, the projects that come online during 2027 or are still in construction at the end of 2027 will generate an additional $400 million of annual adjusted EBITDA that is not reflected in our 2027 guidance window. Beyond construction, our projects are financed with long-term nonrecourse debt that fully amortizes using project-level cash flows over the life of the PPA. This project debt is nonrecourse to the AES parent, resulting in a capital structure that is robust and low risk.\nTurning to Slide 28. This chart provides an example of the typical debt and EBITDA levels we would expect over the life of a U.S. renewables project. While a new project is under construction, debt ramps up with no corresponding EBITDA. Once the project is placed in service, there is a material reduction in the debt balance as more than half of the construction debt is repaid through the monetization of tax attributes. The remainder is refinanced using long-term fixed rate amortizing project debt that is pre-hedged when the PPA is signed.\nIn the first full year of operations, leverage ratios begin at approximately 6x debt to EBITDA and will continue to decline each year as the project debt amortizes. This example helps demonstrate how AES leverage ratios appear artificially high while we execute on our ongoing construction program but will come back down as our operating portfolio reaches a larger scale.\nIn conclusion, 2025 is an inflection point for our business. The renewables segment will increase over 60% in 2025 and will yield annual growth at least in line with our 19% to 21% guidance through 2027. Utilities rate base growth is even stronger than previously expected. While energy infrastructure continues to contribute meaningfully to EBITDA and cash, we have taken actions to streamline our organization and reduce both costs and capital investments. These actions are further increasing our cash flows and will enable AES to deliver increasingly higher credit metrics as we execute on our backlog.\nFinally, we are on track to achieve our long-term financial guidance. I look forward to providing updates throughout the year as we continue executing on our plan and capitalizing on the actions we have taken to ensure continued success at AES. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.\n\nAndrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The AES Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. In conclusion, here are the key points we want to leave with you today. There is an unprecedented need for incremental energy to power the AI revolution in the United States. Notwithstanding concerns about potential regulatory changes under the new administration, renewables have the best time to market at a competitive price. Additionally, we are well insulated from potential changes in U.S. renewables policy or tariffs through safe harbor protections for our backlog, having locked in equipment and EPC pricing and established domestically based supply chains.\nOur renewables business is at an inflection point with improving financial results from the combination of continued growth, reaching economies of scale and reductions in development expenses. We are reaffirming our longer-term growth rates through 2027 as we execute on our 11.9 gigawatt backlog. And we are taking steps to improve our credit metrics. As always, we are highly focused on delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, and we believe that AES is very well positioned to meet both our customers' energy demand as well as our financial commitments. Operator, please open the line for questions."

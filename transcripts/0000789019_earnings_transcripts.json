[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel.\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, we will provide our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website. Today's call is being recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year-over-year. And our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only 2 years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent.\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet scale cloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We are innovating rapidly across the family of Copilots spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer.\nAnd as you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone for both companies and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we have roughly 10x-ed our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, our rev share, exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity for Azure continue until [ AGI ] or through 2030. And we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. And we are also energized to innovate and pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots as well as with agents.\nWe have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next 2 years, reflecting the demand signals we see. Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone.\nAnd we have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible fleet that's been continuously modernized and spans all stages of the AI life cycle from pretraining to post training to synthetic data generation and inference. And it also goes beyond GenAI workloads to recommendation engines, databases and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon systems and software to maximize performance and efficiency.\nIt's this combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements.\nIn Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this infrastructure, we are building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500. We offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models more than any other vendor, including as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5 as well as X AI's Grok 4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for and get personalized recommendations. And Open Evidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant, which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and help streamline charting.\nWhen it comes to our first-party models, we are excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leader boards. And we continue to make great progress with our five family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x year-over-year.\nBeyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with compliance, observability and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth. And once again, this quarter, Azure took share.\nNow let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly active users of our AI features across our products. And our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across the information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer.\nWhen it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot is becoming the UI for the agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Teams. Just 9 months since release, tens of millions of users across Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increase.\nThis quarter, we also introduced agent mode, which turns single prompts into export quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentation and then iterate to deliver the final product much like agent mode in coding tools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best-in-class.\nBeyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer, but Teams mode announced this week, you can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation. And our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager, prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decision, kick off group tasks.\nWe are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and Workday, all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. And customers are also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users doubled quarter-over-quarter. And just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context.\nAll this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, all up more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global and the U.K.'s Tax and Payments and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyds Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average of 46 minutes daily.\nAnd a large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner, PwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just 6 months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this identic transformation with saving millions of hours an employee productivity.\nWhen it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users. For example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now home to over 180 million developers and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within the first week.\nOverall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. And just yesterday, at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agent, extending get up privatives like PRs, issues, actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthroopic, Google, Cognition, X AI as well as OSS and in-house models. GitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability and governance.\nWe are building a similar system in security with over 3 dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender Purview and Intune. For example, with our phishing triage agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5x more efficient in detecting malicious mails.\nIn health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year-over-year. More than 650 health care organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health where over 1,000 physicians are actively using it.\nFinally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows. Every Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Just 2 weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With vision, Copilot sees what you see on your screen and you can have a real-time conversation about it. And with action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with both web and desktop apps.\nIn Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multistep workflows within the browser and help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities, we took share again in search. Daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Among many updates we made last week is groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience.\nWe also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 premium. It brings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a secure way.\nFinally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile and our new Xbox Ally.\nBeyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL, DB, hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In Business Applications, Dynamics 365 gained share. In security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals. 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter-over-quarter. 40,000 [indiscernible] customers, and we took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members.\nAnd finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like [indiscernible], Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2, reaching 155 million monthly active users, Minecraft at an all-time high, and set new record for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch 2 weeks ago and set new records for players on PC.\nIn closing, our planet-scale cloud and AI factory together with Copilots across high-value domains is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact. And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads. And together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week.\nNow on to the quarter, we delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership position in key markets.\nThis quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $4.13 and an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance.\nCompany gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year-over-year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud.\nOperating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger-than-anticipated results and high-margin businesses this quarter.\nWhen adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest of payments related to data center finance leases.\nCapital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps at AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment.\nThe remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites. And cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to finance leases as well as the normal timing of goods received, but not yet paid.\nCash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion with minimal impact from a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases.\nAnd finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past 2 years. And even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years.\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year-over-year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier.\nNow to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency with 1 point of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments though primarily in our small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings.\nM365 Commercial products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent Solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers.\nAzure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online.\nIn our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated.\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume as well as the continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. And in gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency against a strong prior year comparable. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from third-party content.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30% driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier.\nNow moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point.\nStarting with the total company, we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality.\nNow other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, will provide our outlook, excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset interest expense. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nNext, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY '26 growth rate to be higher than FY '25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases.\nNext, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year, driven by the continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure.\nNow to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 33.3 billion to USD 33.6 billion or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 Commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition dynamics.\nM365 Consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens with continued growth across all workloads.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 32.25 billion to USD 32.55 billion or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year.\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.\nIn More Personal Computing. We expect revenue to be in the USD 13.95 billion to USD 14.45 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year. Search and News advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing.\nAnd in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against the prior year comparable that benefited from strong first priority performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year.\nAnd in closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term.\nWith that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.",

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across six continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first GW and multi-GW data centers.\nWe stood up more than two GWs of new capacity over the past 12 months alone, and we continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. We are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT-4 family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements.\nThis quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter. Nestlé, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near-zero business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be quantum, and I'm excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a level two quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments with decade-long arcs while making progress every quarter. The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application.\nMicrosoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to NoSQL to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum, with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest-growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and therefore it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission-critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every ChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles, and conversational state. And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT, as well as OpenAI's developer APIs.\nThis year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability, and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost, and use case requirements. With Foundry, they can provision inference and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok, and very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI. We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. We are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry agent service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks.\nFor example, Nasdaq is using Foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry. When we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. When you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work, workflow, and work artifacts.\nWe rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together Chat, Search, Create, Notebooks, as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity, as shown by our week-over-week retention. We saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch, with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally, following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter.\nTens of thousands of organizations have already used our researcher and analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot tuning, they can easily create agents fine-tuned on their company's data, workflow, and style that reflect their unique tone, language, and expertise. We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions, starting with developers.\nGitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode and new form factors like Coding Agent, which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75% quarter over quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases. 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year. The surge in web coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Cloud Code, Codex, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. Our code review agent is being used heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In healthcare, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot.\nCustomers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year-over-year. For example, at Mercy Health System, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden so that they can focus on providing better care. They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, \"The best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years.\" In security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the BizApps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications.\nDynamics 365 took share this year, and we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-Flowers with contact center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot Composer, Chat, Discover, Search, and Actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continues to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything.\nWe are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure, as well as our Copilots and agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools, as well as third-party ecosystem, over 350 connectors. We're also extending the systems customers already use for governance, identity, security, and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions, policies, and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2 million AI apps. Purview is used by three-quarters of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data.\nAll up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about two consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user reach, LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with four consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30%, and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales. When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6.\nTotal hours surpassed 2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. We have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay streamed via the cloud this year, and Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time. In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in Microsoft's opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.\nThis year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128 billion, up 17% year-over-year, as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. In our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, we're innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, while operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 24% and 22% in constant currency. For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 37% and 30% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable.\nStrong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, as well as an increase in the number of 10 million and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365, helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 37% and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 49%. This quarter, our annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion ahead of expectations and grew 27% and 25% in constant currency.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down 2.0% year-over-year, from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 commercial cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1.0% year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased 2.0% year-over-year to 45%. Better than expected revenue growth, coupled with a focus on operating efficiently, drove the margin expansion. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Now to our segment results.\nRevenue from productivity and business processes was $33.1 billion and grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by M365 commercial products and cloud services, and M365 consumer products and cloud services. M365 commercial cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, with two points of benefit from end-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the end-period revenue recognition, with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing.\nM365 consumer cloud revenue was better than expected, increasing 20%, driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, with growth across all businesses, though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 23% and 21% in constant currency with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions, leading to growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 7% and 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the intelligent cloud segment.\nRevenue was $29.9 billion and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by Azure and our on-premises server business. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. While we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency ahead of expectations, primarily driven by transactional purchasing, which also has higher end-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 7% and 6% in constant currency, with growth in enterprise support services partially offset by a decline in industry solutions.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4.0% year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 4% in constant currency, and operating income grew 23%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%, exceeding expectations, primarily due to Windows OEM, as well as Xbox content and services. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue Ex-tax increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable impact from third-party partnerships, including the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. In gaming, revenue increased 10%.\nXbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year, with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency. Operating income increased 34% and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of financed leases, where we recognized the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to financed leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals.\nCash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. This quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. Finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full-year commentary for FY 26. First, FX.\nAssuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full-year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense growth by 1 point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY 26. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses, given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY 25, with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2.\nWe remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility, and as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. Finally, we expect our FY 26 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in productivity and business processes and roughly 1 point in intelligent cloud and more personal computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform.\nAs a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67% down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $32.2 to $32.5 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%, with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX, as noted earlier.\nIn M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both the Windows commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to end-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s, driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. In Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens, with continued growth across all workloads.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $30.1 to $30.4 billion US dollars, or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX, as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates, depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from end-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid single digits, with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.\nIn more personal computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 to 12.9 billion US dollars. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex-tax revenue growth should be in the low to mid teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize, following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall, search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. In gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits.\nAgainst a strong prior-year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $24.3 to $24.5 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of $15.7 to $15.8 billion, or growth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be -$1.3 billion, primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY 25 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago.\nOur focus remains on investing in security, quality, and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for FY 26. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for Uncle McCall, we request the participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up their handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Excellent.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic end to FY 25. I've been covering Microsoft for a while. I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where everything came together this well. So congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term focus question to start out. You guys have always had software startups as customers and potentially emerging competitors, but the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribing valuations, which assume these companies become major players in software. They're underwriting revenue forecasts measured in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these startups have also grown to be some of your biggest customers, so they're contributing significantly to Microsoft today. So it seems like there's a lot of potential opportunity in supporting those businesses, but also it's not certain that they're going to stay your customers as they scale.\nThey could insource some of that infrastructure, and they very likely emerge as potential competitors. So as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guys manage that risk versus reward with these quickly emerging AI labs and these AI startups?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith, for the question. I don't think it's that different from even sort of the previous era. There's always been, I'll call it, head apps or new companies that emerge that, in fact, are very needed in order to birth a new platform. Back in the day when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the lake and sort of see Netflix and Amazon, and I say, \"I wish Netflix ran on Azure.\" And in some sense, that's kind of what we now have, which is the largest AI workloads run on Azure.\nAnd when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the entire platform faster. Everything from what you're doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot is, guess what, going to be most relevant for any AI application going forward. The entire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the hardest challenges of any AI application called context engineering, which is how do you collect your data and then make sure that the context around the prompts remain stable over a long period so that you get the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly, or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion.\nIn fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what's the sort of all the tier two applications that are being built.\nSo that speaks a little bit, Keith, to, I think, your question is, as long as we have head apps shaping the platform, and then after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense we're both of those is what we're seeing. So I feel very good about being in standing going forward.\nThanks, Keith. All right. The next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. I'd also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter, and you did it, so congratulations. And thank you for taking my question.\nSatya and Amy, we're now two plus years into the GenAI revolution, and adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term?\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThank you. Yeah. I'll start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean, if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like the server to cloud transition was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right?\nWhich is, we did a bunch of servers, except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it was all hard, and so therefore the market was a certain size, whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst, and you could spin up and spin down. The expertise required came down. So it was just orders of magnitude. That's what's happening. So if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute is going to grow, and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating intelligence. Now, how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure?\nI kind of, to Keith's earlier question, I talked a little bit about how the infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but they will be an order or two of magnitude more. So literally, in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute. That ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence, and they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application, perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as code completions on an IDE.\nThen we added the chat interface to it. Then we added the agent mode to it, and now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously, right? So all those four things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repositories. So if I had to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise, and then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors. And so that's exactly the same thing that's happening with Microsoft 365. That's the same thing that's happening with Dynamics 365.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nSo you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier, and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up, and that's what I think shows up in the results.\nAnd I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things in the layers that we talked about, is really we're seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too, right? There's a per-user logic. There's tiers of per-user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption. Sometimes there's pure consumption models. I think you'll continue to see a blending of these, especially as the AI model capability grows. You'll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job.\nAnd I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on the go forward.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. I appreciate it.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. All right. Next question, please.\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks. Satya and Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like an acceleration in on-premises to Azure migration activity. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the of customer conversations you've had, whether there are a couple of two or three specific catalysts that are driving that migration, and how durable a trend do you think that is? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. There are three things that are really happening. One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestlé, with the SAP instances.\nThey moved along with a lot of the data that's associated with it and a bunch of servers. So that's kind of a classic example, I think, whether it's VMware migrations, migrations of SAP, or even just our own server migrations. They're pretty healthy, and it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best, maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud-native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff. Just the classic cloud-native e-commerce company, let's say. These are scaling in a big way. Some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there because they have come for AI, perhaps, but they now stay for more than AI.\nAnd so to me, that's another thing you see in overall what's happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workloads. So those are three things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that's kind of what's driving our growth.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. All right. The next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nSatya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter. Was there anything that jumped out or surprised you, that you didn't think you were going to see, but you did see in the quarter? The magnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. I don't know, Brent, if anything really surprised us.\nBut I think what you're noticing in our own build-out of these AI applications and in general is the platform becoming more than, \"Here's a model, and here's an API. Make some calls,\" right? I mean, that's in some sense was a bit of the state of the art maybe even a year ago, whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack. I mean, take even the storage tier stuff, right? The degree of sophistication you have and, \"Hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by preprocessing so that your prompt engineering or context engineering, as I call it, can be better and higher quality?\" So I think all of that is emerging.\nSo when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric, and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around it are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that's what I feel great about, is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack, the speed with which that's emerging, that you can build applications is much faster, right? I always go back and say, \"Hey, when a relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say.\" And this thing, we're kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on, I think, the degree of maturity that's emerging.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. All right. The next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well.\nI have one question around Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we're all realizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. What are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point, and then from there on, it's becoming much, much broader? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. I think that that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it, right? You now have analysts and researchers who just talk about two examples, and of course, people also third-party agents. So yeah, there is a lot more of just not request-respond. It's about spawning, essentially, applications that then go do work and come back.\nBut the UI still remains very important, right? Even for asynchronous work, to instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. It may be different. It may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the code check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot code review agent, even if you used maybe Cloud Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's, I think, what's happening across all of these systems. So you're absolutely right that it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat-focused, but it quickly goes beyond it, and you see it in M365.\nYou see it in Dynamics 365, and you see it in GitHub.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Ryan. All right. The next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, Thank you very much. Amy, I want to acknowledge that I think a few quarters ago, you said that you reached a point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx. So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your public services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of CapEx vis-à-vis Azure growth in the years ahead, particularly as we listen to Satya's comments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure?\nAre we at a point where we're going to have to continue to do this and magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and therefore create a richer gross margin mix? Thank you so much for your comments, and congrats on the quarter.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full-year comments I've made on CapEx as well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud.\nSo in terms of feeling good about the ROI, the growth rates, and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on-the-books business that we need to deliver, and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look, I always talked about the growth rate will decline year-over-year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short-lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking, storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about it, my gosh, in January and said, \"I thought we'd be in better supply-demand shape by June.\" And now I'm saying, \"I hope I'm in better shape by December.\" And that's not because we slowed CapEx.\nEven with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can, we are still seeing demand improve. So I am not as focused, Cash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm focused on building backlog, building business, and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done. So I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point because when you're in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you're going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms of winning. So I tend to put my energy more there.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, I think one of the other things, Kash, is that I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a hoster and a hyperscaler is software, and the same is going to be true here. That GPT-4o example I gave is all software, right? The optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come. But as Amy said, while you're really going and building out the plant, you don't want to sort of serialize it. You just want to go in parallel on all of these fronts, and that's sort of what will compound over time.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nI do think it's important when Satya talks about the software layer; he's talking about in his comments to connect the stack to the compounding S curves. So I would remind people that is something that we saw through the prior cloud transition. It's how we operated through that one. And the same sort of skills and logic done at an even faster pace is what will apply the same transition. Sounds very encouraging.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. All right. The next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, great. Thanks very much for taking the questions, and congrats from me as well on the metrics working in concert here.\nAmy, maybe on margin. Impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming year as you absorb some of the mixed shift towards Azure and some of the more AI-focused offerings. Can you speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade-offs and offset some of the mixed shift? And I'm wondering specifically just on any productivity gains you're seeing from leveraging AI internally that you'd highlight or anything else you'd just mentioned in underpinning the full-year expectation there. Thank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft",
    "content2": "Thanks, Michael. I think really the area to focus on is when you think about margin. I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver great product that's competitive, innovative, and can take share because that drives revenue.\nRevenue itself and revenue growth, as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement. It builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Kash a little bit about before. Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies, whether that's at whatever layer of the stack that exists. The S-curve's compound, and we are doing that work, and we're focused on it. At the same time, we're doing the build-out. So you'll see improvements there even as we continue to invest. Then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here, focus on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success.\nAnd so when we have those three things happen and the energy's right and the focus is there, it gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, it starts and ends really with product, which is what we're really focused on here and delivering that to customers.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThat all sounds pretty good. Thanks very much.\n\nJonathan Neilson\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed Outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide Outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates and constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Brett. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year over year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof of concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year over year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws continue to compound across both pre-training and inference-time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now.\nOn inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the commercial cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference, as well as geo-distribution. From now on, it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software-driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals.\nWe have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks, and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet, as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost, and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. We remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP, and VMware apps.\nAt the data layer, we're seeing Microsoft Fabric break out. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest-growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric, with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT, Copilot, or enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services, and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure app services more than doubled year over year, driving significant growth in adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI platform and tools. As we shared last week, we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment.\nThrough our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. With OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models. OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned. Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, runtimes to build agents, multi-agent apps, AIOps, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users. We are well-positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of open-source models and SLMs. DeepSeek R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub, with automated red teaming, content safety integration, and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times.\nWe also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige, Rockwell Automation, and Siemens to address industry-specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy, and maintain code is fundamentally changing. GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify, as well as the world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC, and KPMG. We have been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot in VS Code with more than a million sign-ups in just the first week post-launch. All up, GitHub now is home to 150 million developers, up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow.\nWe are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now has 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson, and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. Overall, the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter over quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter over quarter. We are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat, which was announced earlier this month.\nCopilot Chat, along with Copilot Studio, is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio, and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone, up over 2x quarter over quarter. We have also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries, and access SharePoint data. We also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI, as well as our momentum with agents, is our rich data cloud, which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge.\nBillions of emails, documents, and chats, hundreds of millions of Teams meetings, and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the enterprise knowledge cloud. It is growing fast, up over 25% year over year. More broadly, what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications. We are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, TotalEnergies, and Viant switched to our AI-powered apps from legacy providers. In healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician-patient encounters, up 54% quarter over quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10.\nCustomers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% of premium-priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs. We expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more developers from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. They will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models locally on Copilot+ PCs, as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. Beyond Copilot+ PCs, the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to security.\nWe continue to make progress with our Secure Future Initiative, and we are applying what we have learned, introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot, organizations across private and public sector, like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, and NTT, can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical, and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high-value conversations on LinkedIn, with comments up 37% year over year. Short-form video continues to grow on the platform, with video creation all up, growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster, and our hiring business again took share in subscriptions.\nLinkedIn Premium surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years, and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now on to search advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off, and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI. Our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first-of-its-kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today, we made Think Deeper, powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming.\nWe are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher-margin content and platform services. We are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was a top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints.\nIn closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era. I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $69.6 billion, up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23, an increase of 10%. We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher-than-expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations.\nCommercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions, with growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations, and decreased 2.0% year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year to 69%, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses, as well as improvement in gaming and search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased 2.0% year over year to 45%. The better-than-expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now to our segment results.\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continued to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. Our growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year over year, with install base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024, as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better-than-expected performance of M365 Suite noted earlier.\nM365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 Consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 86.3 million, with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9%, with continued growth across all lines of business. In our talent solutions business, results were slightly below expectations, driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6%, and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19%, with more unfavorable FX impact than expected.\nExcluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-premises server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better-than-expected results in Azure AI services. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year and was ahead of expectations, even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reached through our sales motions, as we balanced driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations, driven by slower-than-expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations, with lower-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4.0% year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10%, and operating income grew 14%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year over year, with better-than-expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnership in search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in gaming. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 4% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 and support, as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing.\nIn gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency, as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 6.0% year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses, as well as strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher-margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion.\nMore than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals, including our customer contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee, and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year over year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. Finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow, moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud, and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing. When compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 2 points and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth.\nIn commercial bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior-year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year over year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency, or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better-than-expected Q2 results.\nWe expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot, and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year over year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 Suites. So our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits, driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in talent solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. In Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand, given our significant capital investments.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits, driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. In enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion, with continued prioritization of higher-margin opportunities. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid single digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year over year, as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline. Search and news advertising EZTax revenue growth should be in the mid-teens, from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, with share gains across Edge and Bing.\nGrowth is expected to moderate from last quarter, primarily due to additional FX impact and, as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier, returns to more normal levels. Search EZTax growth will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high single digits. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits, driven by first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year over year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or to be between $21.65 billion and $21.85 billion, and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency, or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion.\nOther income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion, primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud.\nHowever, the growth rate will be lower than FY25, and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud, including AI workloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-ups and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. Given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year.\nAnd finally, our FY25 full-year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real-world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen is moving to a new role here as the head of our Americas Sales Finance Team. On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leading investor relations for the past four years and for the partnership with both Satya and me. And I'd like to welcome Jonathan Nielsen, the former head of finance for our security products, who is returning to investor relations to lead the team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A.\nOut of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tool will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys, for taking the question. And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you, and best of luck in that new role.\nLooking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that, about what we saw in Q2, and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component.\nOur Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates, even by weeks. When you're capacity constrained, weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really the challenges were in what we call the sales motions. So think about primarily these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals. We then took our sales motions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.\nAs you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts and whether you have that balance right. So the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. I expect, well, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust.\nI feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully that's just helpful on that. We've talked a little bit about Q3. We've talked about 31 to 32 after publishing a 31 this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place, and that's no different than it was. Our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. When I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right? That's the infrastructure and the land, and then you have to have kits.\nWe're continuing, and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way, to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short power and space. So as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. So the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize, and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat. Keith, hope that's helpful, Satya. Yeah.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nI think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we worked through some of the supply stuff, and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. When you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio of even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So that's all good. The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. It's just a sales place where Amy talked about this nuance, right? How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?\nAt a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form Amy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past. And that's sort of one of the things that we definitely will lean into always.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior Vice President, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger than expected Microsoft AI revenue? We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it, but can you give more color on that?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nOur estimates are that Copilot was much bigger than we expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI beat would be great. Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about, better than expected. A couple of pieces to that, which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. The second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better. What was important about that, it was we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course indirectly does as people get more and more value out of it. Also, price per seat was actually quite good, which does have a good signal for value.\nSo those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our expectations.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThank you. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at lower cost? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that, or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, thanks, Brent. So yeah, in my remarks, I talked about how, in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working and HyperDrive.\nThen on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound. And that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we've observed for a while, which is 10x improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so that's what you see. And then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we are going to obviously now that's all gets commoditized and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right? Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client-server to cloud?\nMore people bought servers, except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I reference these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of 2025, where on the PC you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So that type of optimizations means AI will be much more ubiquitous. And so therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers.\nBut Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years. Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. So I really remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they've committed in a big way to Azure, and even in the bookings, what we recognized is just the first tranche of it.\nAnd so you'll see, given the role that we have, more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because of even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement. But your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right? We're making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo-distributed. We are working super hard on all the software optimizations, right? I mean, just not the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI.\nIn fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it, and that's been key to driving, right? One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right? It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so that's the fleet physics we're managing. And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x. Your optimization is going to give you 10x.\nYou want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So I feel very good about the investment we are making, and it's fungible, and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nAnd maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on CapEx because I think it's helpful to ground a bit more in what Satya is saying a fungible fleet means. We have, and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO. That is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on.\nAnd the faster we can do that, and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers. And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post-training, which is a key component. And then there's just running the commercial cloud, which at every layer under every modern AI app that's going to be built will be required. It'll be required to be distributed, and it'll be required to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so the investment you see is making CapEx. You're right.\nThe front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up, not just on the AI infrastructure we needed. Think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it'll be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much for taking my question, and I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there? Thanks.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nNo, thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact, you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side. We now have Copilot Chat.\nSo this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire install base, effectively, because you can go have this now turned on by IT, and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away. And it has Copilot Studio built in, and so that means they can start building agents. So we think of that, plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate, quite frankly, in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1, the Think Deeper feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1. It's available globally, right?\nSo you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that once were sort of premium tier. And that's all definitely something that we will do across, right? The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot. So across the length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Reback\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what percent of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models? And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, it's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application, right? When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models. You build models, you fine-tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open-source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on. So that's also another side. There's a temporality to it, right? What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different models.\nAnd in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the things that we are investing heavily on is Foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with these flurry of models that are coming in, and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation, but not have all the dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AIOps cost. So we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open-source, closed-source, different weight classes. And at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.\n\nBrad Reback\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength. Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise? And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah.\nI mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team in finance, or in supply chain where there is a lot of, for example, SharePoint-grounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial. But then what's happening, very much like what we've seen in these previous generation productivity things, is that people collaborate across functions, across roles, right? For example, even in my own daily habit, I go to chat, I use Work tab, I get results, and then I immediately share using Pages with colleagues. I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we're seeing.\nIt starts maybe at a departmental level. Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nWonderful. Thank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Equity Capital Market, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you for taking the question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis. Commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade.\nI appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about one of the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, while that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitments. So I want to separate the concept that it's one time versus an ongoing relationship that'll grow as they grow, which it absolutely will.\nAnd to your question on what else is participating in that number, first, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-ons to those contracts, upsells, like for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which, when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good. To your point, in that you're seeing a really broad-based growth, those Azure commitments take two forms.\nOne, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment sign for the platform. Then you have new customers making commitments. We also saw that this quarter. So to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Equity Capital Market, Piper Sandler\n\nCouple of color. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and enjoy the rest of your day."

If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nActual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All up, annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year-over-year, and Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments.\nAs we go through this shift, we are focused on two fundamental things. First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity while in parallel continuing to scale our Cloud business, and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security. Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable long-term operating leverage.\nWith that, let me highlight examples starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year, driven by AI. We expanded our data center footprint, announcing investments across four continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia, and we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake, and Teradata.\nWe continue to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry, from ABB and Cathay Pacific, to La Liga, to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90% year-over-year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Coles, Daimler Truck AG, Domino's, Haleon, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware Solution, we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads to.\nWith Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers' unique cost, latency, and design considerations. All up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year-over-year, and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including, as of this quarter, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It's being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra, as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho, and Zomato.\nWith Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union, and others. With Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including, as of last week, the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry, from Adobe and Bridgestone to Novo Nordisk and Palantir.\nNow on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities, spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance, along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next-generation data platform, now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry, from Accenture and Kroger to Rockwell Automation and ZEISS, up 20% quarter-over-quarter.\nThis quarter, we introduced new first-of-the-kind Real-Time Intelligence capabilities in Fabric, so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time-sensitive data. Now on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations, from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M, to Infosys and Paytm, have adopted Copilot, up 180% year-over-year. We're going further. With Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug, and deploy cycle.\nCopilot is driving GitHub growth all up. GitHub's annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We're also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year-over-year.\nNow on to future of work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers as it transforms work, workflow, and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter. Feedback has been positive, with the majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats.\nAll up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis, and EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. We're going further, adding agent capabilities to Copilot. New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings and create and assign tasks. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom Copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first- and third-party business data.\nTo date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant, and Eaton to KPMG, Majesco, and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter-over-quarter. We're also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare with DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare organizations, including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter-over-quarter, and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled.\nCopilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter as customers like Thermo Fisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot-first solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-800-Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, and Synoptek will rely on it to deliver better customer support. Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP.\nMicrosoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year-over-year as organizations like Dentsu, Eli Lilly, and Ford chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.\nWhen it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews, and we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year-over-year, and we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, AEON, National Australia Bank.\nNow on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative as we implement our principles of Secure by Design, Secure by Default, and Secure Operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for Security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW, and we are also securing customers' AI deployments with updates to Defender and Purview.\nAll up, we now have 1.2 million security customers, over 800,000, including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, and TomTom, use four or more workloads, up 25% year-over-year. Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solution, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\nNow let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform, and video is now the fastest-growing format on LinkedIn, with uploads up 34% year-over-year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, premium sign-ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools.\nOur reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn, and get career coaching. Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year.\nAnd now on to search advertising and news. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge, and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end users, publishers, and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year-over-year, and we again took share across Bing and Edge. We continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience which creates a dynamic response to users' query while maintaining click share to publishers.\nWe continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start, and in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last five years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads, and Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language.\nNow on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices, and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have, including, as of last month, Amazon Fire TVs.\nFinally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most-watched title on the platform ever, and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter-over-quarter. In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long term in our fundamentals, in our innovation, and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom-line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud Platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency.\nThis record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of $10 million plus and $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%.\nAt a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth.\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69%, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision Blizzard acquisition.\nAt a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365.\nPaid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office Commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to 82.5 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI services, where demand remained higher than our available capacity. In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos.\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats, with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, although it was slightly lower than expected transactional purchasing. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior-year comparable for enterprise support services.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 16%, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by Windows Commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected, and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts.\nDevices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. While early days, we're excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19% ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations, with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\nStronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly three points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $19 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI-related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI-related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. For the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI-related spend was similar to Q4.\nCash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. This quarter, other income expense was negative $675 million, more favorable than anticipated, with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year.\nNow, moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a USD basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full-year commentary for FY25. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full-year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth.\nNext, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY24. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management.\nTherefore, we expect FY25 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. Given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY25 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year. Finally, we expect our FY25 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now, to the outlook for our Q1. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than 1 point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth.\nIn commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing Azure base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand, as well as existing AI capacity constraints.\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency, or $20.3 to $20.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365.\nWe expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. In Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or $28.6 to $28.9 billion.\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate.\nIn H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the low single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency, or $14.9 to $15.3 billion.\nWindows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid single digits. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high teens. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits.\nAnd in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid 30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid 50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.95 to $20.15 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.2 to 15.3 billion, including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\nOther income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method, as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nIn closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly three points year-over-year, even as we accelerate our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition, and had a headwind from the change of useful lives last year. So as we begin FY25, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead, aligned, and if needed, adjusted to the demand signals we see.\nWe are committed to growing our leadership across our Commercial Cloud and within that, the AI platform. We feel well-positioned as we start FY25. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instruction?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's an industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth, or do the shifting gross margin profiles change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yields on those investments? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think I'd say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is, what's the product shape of the product portfolio? What we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure metrics as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at.\nAnd how is that value landing with customers, and what's the growth rate? So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we are getting recurring customers or customers coming back, buying more seats, or GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it, what's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say, and obviously the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend.\nBasically, that's the demand signal. Because you've got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60+% is the kit. That only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal. So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully. We can even have things which are semi-constructed we call cold shells and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset, and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal.\nThere is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's in commercial-per-seat side, or on the consumption meters. That's, I think, the fundamental driver.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nAnd Keith, I do think, and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well, because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments and in my comments today. Being able to maybe share a little more about that, when we talked about roughly half of FY24's total capital expense, as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land, builds, and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond.\nThey're incredibly flexible. Because we've built a consistent architecture, first with the Commercial Cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand's at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties, and partners, or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So we've got long-lived, flexible assets. And if you think about it that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo.\nAnd this one, because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's super helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nSenior Analyst on Global Software, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of a roller coaster for tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations, and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter, and O365 Commercial not yet fully visible in numbers, even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings?\nAnd Amy, with cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. Thanks again, Mark, for the question.\nSo to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth in what is our M365 SaaS offering with a new offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean, the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%. That's a pretty good, healthy sign.\nThe most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled. It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamics, that's another exciting place for us, which is one, we're gaining share.\nDynamics with GenAI built-in is sort of really BizApps is probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter.\nOne of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own. So it's just we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it, at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nMark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle, that's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to one Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making one. We're using that internally, first-party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs. So it does, in fact, make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nSenior Analyst on Global Software, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nUS Software Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much, and congrats on a great fiscal year ending. Question for you, Amy. When you look at the CapEx, how do you bring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of the infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates, or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and generative AI? That's the main question on my mind. Thank you so much.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really two pieces, I think, as I heard your question, that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate? And the answer to that is yes, because there's two different pieces. You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned.\nThe pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for, I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect. And we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understanding to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies in capital spend quarter to quarter.\nThe other thing I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a sort of growing distinction between our CapEx number and, on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E. And you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned that in my comments before, but I mention it again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments, and hopefully that's helpful context.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nJust one other thing, Amy, if I wanted to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about; we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item: land, which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time.\nSo those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset: land, network, construction, the system or the kit, and then the ongoing cost. And so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nUS Software Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx, and as Amy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating Azure revenue growth rate, which I guess follows the CapEx surge. Thank you so much once again.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader of Software and Internet Research, Jefferies Financial Group Inc\n\nThanks. Amy, the magnitude of beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on sales cycles, the close rate that you saw? Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the quarter, commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good. Execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion was good, as expected. The larger long-term commitments were better than we expected. So Brent, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader of Software and Internet Research, Jefferies Financial Group Inc\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta.\nI guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments, there's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half. And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure-specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter? Thank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it just so people can hear it in my words as well. To that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end at 30%. You're exactly right. The difference between being at the higher end or at the lower end really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption, really made the difference in that number. We've assumed that going forward into H1, inclusive of my guide at 28% to 29% going forward.\nThen let me separate, which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you're right. Capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure, remained in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully that's helpful.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Thank you, Amy.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, Duetsche Bank Research\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand, once again, greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build-out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near-term and long-term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and CoreWeave, for example? Thank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are, and we've talked about, I think, now for quite a few quarters, we are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually, we've, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity. We've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit, as we've talked about, in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced place.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. I mean, to me, it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. You could even say sometimes buying from Oracle, maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter date.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, Duetsche Bank Research\n\nExcellent. Thanks for the color.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Enterprise Software Research, JPMorgan Chase & Co",
    "content2": "Thank you very much. With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilot to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high, and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000-seat deals, the repeat purchases. Is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rates equally high in Office as they will be in GitHub?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot Workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec, and from a spec, you create a plan, and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. You see this even now. For example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt, but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data.\nSo this customer email is in the context of some order. All of the CRM record gets completed in context, and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio. You can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say, if this email comes from this customer whose order date has got a particular issue with it, you can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves. What used to be line-of-business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward.\nSo we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which will be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow, and work artifact, all being driven by Copilot.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Enterprise Software Research, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nSenior Research Analyst on Software and IT Services, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox content and services revenue grew 61%, 58 points help from Activision. So net is about three points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this area? You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming area? What are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both, what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console, and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high-scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC, and mobile.\nBut we're also excited about these new sockets. I mean, the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded xCloud to Amazon Fire TV. I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get to reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI. And that's what we're building towards. And that was the strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you wanted to add to it.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nNo, I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broadened set of content to more users in more places and really build what looks more like to us a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long-term. As Satya mentioned, things where, with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP for Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day."

It was a record third quarter powered by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot Stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services to models, data, and infrastructure, are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now I'll highlight examples walking up the stack, starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service.\nWe also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open-source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It's already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our models-as-a-service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers from Accenture and EY to Schneider Electric are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including, as of this quarter, the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. And as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow, and average spend continues to increase.\nWe also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like Dick's Sporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2x year over year, and we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oréal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion-dollar-plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and the Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals increased over 80% year over year, while the number of $10 million-plus deals more than doubled. Now on to data and analytics.\nOur Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capability spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL, and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They've used Cosmos DB along with Azure OpenAI Service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer, to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU, and Lumen, and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that's consolidated in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake.\nPower BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric, provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter over quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itaú, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest, and Volvo Cars. Copilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform too. AT&T, Citigroup, and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with Copilot. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers, and revenue accelerated over 45% year over year.\nAnyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter over quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up, over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100, have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year over year. Now on to future work. We are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion of knowledge are to productivity of an organization.\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns. That's having a cascading effect, changing work, work artifacts, and workflows, and driving better decision-making, collaboration, and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes, from enterprises to small businesses. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot, and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies, with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody's, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats. We're also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we're not stopping there. We're accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year.\nWith Copilot and Dynamics 365, we're helping businesses transform every role and business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O'Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation, and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from Dynamics as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own Copilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work.\nWhen it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter over quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months, and this quarter, we introduced new Surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there's much more to come. In just a few weeks, we'll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We're rolling out a new version, which is up to 2x faster while using 50% less memory to all customers.\nWe surpassed 1 million Teams rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling, now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark, all chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We're also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 healthcare organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care, and WellSpan Health.\nAnd in manufacturing this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens, and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our number one priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools, and innovation with customers.\nA great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights. Now let me talk about our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell, and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which have reached over 12 million contributions, are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year.\nAnd we are also seeing strength across other businesses, with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Now on to search advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines, and descriptions. Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices.\nWe set third-quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage, and monthly active devices. Last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title, Diablo IV, to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among the top 25 on the PlayStation Store, more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q3 revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%, and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth, with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size, and deal length, as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to our expansion for our office commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion.\nRoughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. This quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately four points to revenue growth, was a two-point drag on operating income growth, and had a -4% impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.\nFX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23% ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18%, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly one point, even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\nGrowth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned, as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10%, with nine points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23%, and operating margins increased roughly two points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly three points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, Oracle growth from continued E5 momentum, and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to 80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and talent solutions businesses. However, in talent solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1%, and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the intelligent cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%, ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed seven points of growth, as expected.\nIn the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments, as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher-end period recognition. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security install base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher-end period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior-year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1%, and operating income grew 32%. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17%, with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming, and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier, as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations, with impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier, as well as lower-end period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts.\nDevices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency, as we remained focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 12%, ahead of expectations, with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge. In gaming, revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency, with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency, with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly four points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\nOperating expenses increased 41%, with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was -$854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. Finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow moving to our Q4 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the US dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than one point. When compared to our January guide for Q4 FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately one point, and operating expense growth by less than one point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base, driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly two points year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 Cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly, as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure, will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by Cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency, or $19.9 to $20.2 billion.\nIn Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and overall growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or $28.4 to 28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency, or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business and continued contribution from AI, with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits on a high prior-year comparable for enterprise support services. In more personal computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency, or $15.2 to $15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits, as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\nIn devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens, as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s, driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.6 to 19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\nWe expect operating expense of $17.15 to $17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full-year FY24 operating margins to be up over two points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition, and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility.\nWe expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now, I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY25, that focus and execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth. To scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY25 capital expenditures to be higher than FY24. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services, so we will manage that signal through the year.\nWe will also continue to prioritize operating leverage, and therefore we expect FY25 operating margins to be down only about one point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.\nYou may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. A lot of excitement in the marketplace around generative AI and the potential of these technologies, but there's also a lot of investment going on behind them. It looks like Microsoft's on track to ramp CapEx over 50% year-on-year this year to over $50 billion, and there's media speculation of more spending ahead, with some reports talking about like a $100 billion data center.\nSo obviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution, but what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how you, as the management team, try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments, because they are getting very big. Maybe if you give us some hints on whether there's any truth to the potential of like a $100 billion data center out there? Thank you so much.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Keith, for the question. Let me start, and then Amy can add at a high level. The way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this. There is training, and there's inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward. Then Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand-driven. In other words, we track very closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we'll manage, as Amy said in her remarks, very, very closely. So we feel, and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. So this is not the quarter.\nI realize in the news it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays, but if you look at it, we've been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nKeith, I do think it's important to really think about our planning cycles, and we do talk about spending sequentially higher, and we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand. Another thing that you really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. So when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant.\nThe opportunity to power that next wave of \"cloud infrastructure\" is important. It's important because we've been the leaders through this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade. Watch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation, and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add, and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader of Software/Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nSatya, how would you characterize the demand environment?\nOn one hand, you have bookings in Azure both accelerating year-over-year in the quarter, but we're seeing a lot of future concern and hesitation from other vendors we all cover. So I think everyone would love to get your sense of budget health for customers this year.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nGreat question, Brent. There are a couple of things I'd say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very, very good about the, we're fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing any AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks are new Azure customers. So that's one.\nThe second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT, is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI, and so Cosmos DB integration. So the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great attraction. So we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say migrations to Azure as well. So this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers.\nI mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also, as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow, and then they'll optimize. So it's a continuous side of it. So these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on the demand side.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader of Software/Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nMD, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter and the guidance. I want to follow up on the AI, obviously. We're seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI.\nAt some point, for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level? Will it be net increased to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that that spending could be shifted from core Azure toward Azure AI. Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying a good place to start is to watch what's happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean, if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right?\nSo you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps a shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you're spending today, right? That's really a good example of, I think, what's going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in marketing. Anywhere there's operation. That's why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean knowledge work, right? So because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations. When I say culture change, that means process change.\nAmy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day, companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions. That requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. This is where we're going to see firm-level performance differences. One of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft; we see it, right? We're also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process. We know that this is not just about technology. It's about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. We see it in software development. We see it in customer service.\nWe're seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today, where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so that's like the PC when it became standard issue in the early '90s. That's the closest analogy I can come up with. And so yes, it'll take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right? It's faster than any suite we have sold in the past. And what it is, we're going to require workflow and process change.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nAnd Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe something that was core consumption to an AI project? In our results, that's not what we saw.\nWe saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is you see maybe growth in migrations again. You're seeing work in the data space again, and you're seeing AI project starts. And I think that's why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, and you see IT budget spend. It's because it's a share, I think, improvement, plus also really focusing on what Satya said. It's about spending maybe in other areas that we don't traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO. It's spend being done by the head of customer service. It's spend being done by the head of marketing. And I do think that will be important as we think about the opportunity ahead.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nMD, SVP and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nIncredibly helpful. Thank you both.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Carl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nMD Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you. Satya and Amy, congrats on these outstanding Azure results. I'd love to hone in a little bit on the seven-point lift to Azure growth from AI. Outstanding number, but it's leveling off a little bit from six points in December. I'm wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. To what extent did the capacity issues that you, Amy, highlighted on the call impact that number? Is there any seasonality? I wouldn't think so, or any other factor that can swing around that number that you'd advise us to keep in mind. Thanks so much.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Carl. There's not a seasonality to the number. So you're absolutely right to start there, and it's a good question.\nThe way to think about it is a bit more by it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side in particular. And so that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that it is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So it is fair to say that that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and does impact a little bit the number in Q4.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nMD Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Carl. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nMD, Barclays\n\nThank you. And I have more of a conceptual question for Satya.\nIf you think about Copilot and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of different businesses, and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain Copilots versus the rest of the industry following, and everyone seems to have a Copilot now and seems to be talking about it? How does that impact what you want to do, your partner strategy going forward? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. It's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work.\nThey're doing knowledge work in support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain, or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to know. They do it inside of email. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate whether it's with ServiceNow, where it has the ability to integrate with SAP, with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing. In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility.\nAnd Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise is you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications, and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it to make that happen. And so that's what we're seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all these other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting. The meeting is in the context of some business process.\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all of that data right in the Teams context. So that's, I think, what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say were underappreciated for the amount of work, how people use those tools to make progress on business process, but we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools more horizontally.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nMD, Barclays\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Raimo. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nMD and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, great. I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to go back to Azure.\nYou've been hinting at stabilization there for the past couple of quarters, but still very good to see the bounce. Maybe you can expand on just what the commercial bookings number, appreciating the variability there, does in terms of visibility. And any characterization you can give us around what you're seeing in areas like cost optimization and core workload growth coming back is just helpful context for us in unpacking the numbers. Thank you\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft",
    "content2": ". Thanks, Michael. Maybe I may take those a bit in reverse. It's a little easier to address them.\nWhen you think about what we've been talking about, sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number, as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Carl, was seven points of contribution from AI, and you could call the difference 24 from our core really Azure business. Within that, the activity we saw on the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts, and we saw optimizations. Then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. That cycle, which is actually quite normal, we saw it again this quarter in a balanced way.\nI think so when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which was a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows that companies are still going from on-prem to cloud. That's why Satya mentioned migrations. Some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects, this is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings. The total TCO is still really good. So I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter. I feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent, is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying, \"Do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization?\" I really do look sort of workload to workload. What are we seeing? Where are starts? And this one actually felt quite balanced, and optimizations looked like they normally would, which, by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think you all may ask the question more as a negative, and for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nMD and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nNow, consistent core cloud growth is still pretty exciting to us as well. Thank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity, Evercore ISI\n\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Satya, I was wondering if you could chime in on a discussion that comes up a lot with investors, which is, is there a sort of data quality problem in the market in terms of being able to take advantage of all these new GenAI capabilities? And I was just curious if you could comment on, do you see companies making inroads on sort of addressing that? And do you see that as sort of an inhibitor to AI growth at all at this point? Thanks.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. It's a great question because there are two sets of things in order to make sense of successful deployment of these new AI capabilities.\nI mean, if you sort of say this, what is this AI? It does two things, right? There's a new user experience. There's a natural language interface. And the second thing is it's a reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data. And good requires good data for grounding, right? So people talk about something called Retrieval Augmented Generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then helps with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available.\nThe sophistication of how people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers there to help enterprises. So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think on the commercial side. These are some of the harder problems to solve, broad consumer, right? I mean, I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated, open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to GitHub. If you think about how it's got an entire system, right? It's just not an AI model.\nIt's the AI or the user experience scaffolding, the editor, the chat, the interpreter, and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work. Effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio, and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot-like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced as business value and better grounding. But you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or Postgres or SQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Thanks, Kirk.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nOperator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.Please proceed.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nMD And Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask the AI question, but from a Microsoft 365 Copilot perspective. I think you talked a little bit about starting to see some of those impacts positively in the quarter on the Office business. I wanted to ask more broadly around that capacity constraint that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, Amy, and kind of how does the easing how tied are we as you invest for that CapEx and bring more of the capacity online? How much does that unblock or unlock the ability to deliver both a higher Azure AI number as well as a higher Microsoft 365 Copilot number?\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks for the question. It's a good opportunity to clarify. And I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots.\nIt's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per-user businesses are able to continue to grow. And so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nMD And Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you all.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press Star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iverson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and Financial Summary Slide Deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed Outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide Outlook\ncommentary on today's call. Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard this quarter, and we are reporting its results in our More Personal Computing segment beginning on 13 October 2023. Accordingly, our Xbox content and services revenue growth investor metric includes the net impact of Activision.\nAdditionally, our press release and slide deck contain supplemental information regarding the net impact of the Activision acquisition on our financial results. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance. In addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results, all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period\nof last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nWhere growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call we'll be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that\nare subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Brett. It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia. With\nAzure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLMs and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.\nWe now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over 1/3 are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new model-as-a-service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Encore, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM Phi for their applications. We have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models\nincluding GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3, as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first startups like Moveworks, Perplexity, and SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today, including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how its millions of customers shop more broadly. Customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their\ncloud migration. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.\nNow, on to data, we are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale, powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Coles to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI services to power an AI assistant which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All up, Cosmos\nDB data transactions increase 42% year over year. For those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI Search offers the best hybrid search solution.\nOpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT, and this quarter we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-Cloud data lake OneLake increased 46% quarter over quarter. Now onto developers from GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year over year, driven by all our platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool.\nWe now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter over quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will roll out GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year, and we're going further, making Copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot Enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organizations' codebases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language.\nWe're also the leader in low-code/no-code development, helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze, and now build custom copilots.\nMore than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom Copilots. It has already been used by over 10,000 organizations, including An Post, Holland America, and PG&E, in just weeks. For example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built Copilot to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their\nmarketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too.\nIn sales, our Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies, Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. With our new Copilot for Service, employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry Clouds, we are tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health, and UPMC to increase physician productivity and\nreduce burnout. Our Cloud for retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value.\nNow onto future of work, a growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. Overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, and Pfizer all deploy Copilot to their employees and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We are also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and\nTrello as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot capabilities.\nWhen it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration, chat, meetings, and calling on one platform, and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than 2/3 of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats, and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, and WTW all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics.\nNow on to Windows in 2024, AI will become first class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster, from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years. By providing one-click access, we also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and\nWindows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their Cloud PCs.\nUsage of Cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year over year, and all-up Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2x year over year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now on to security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported a week and a half ago, have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our Secure Future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across\nboth new products and legacy infrastructure. It's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture.\nTo help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture, our industry first unified security operations platform brings together our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR, Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for Security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. With Copilot for Security, we are now helping hundreds of early access customers including CEMEX, Dow, LTIMindtree, McAfee, and Nucor Steel significantly increased their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter we extended Copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow\nElectronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, J.B. Hunt, and The Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member signups in key markets like Germany and India.\nIn an ever changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill building and knowledge sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year over year. Our new AI powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs, and engage with posts. New AI features, including more personalized InMails, also continue to increase business ROI on the platform, and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter, and more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the\nmomentum. Earlier this month we achieved a new milestone with five billion images created and five billion chats conducted to date, both doubling quarter over quarter, and both Bing and Edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. Just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter, we set all-time records for monthly active users on Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now\nhave over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With Cloud Gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love, where and when and how they want.\nOur streams increased 44% year over year. Great content is key to our growth across our portfolio. I've never been more excited about our lineup of upcoming games. Earlier this month we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass, including Indiana Jones. We've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises which brings in millions of players each month including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency, when adjusted for the prior year. Q2 charge operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectation, and we've delivered another quarter of double digit top and bottom line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses. As Satya referenced, in our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, including AI services,\ndrove better than expected growth in large long term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.\nCommercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%, and this quarter our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in\nline with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre pandemic levels. Console market was a bit smaller.\nAs a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately four points to revenue growth with a two-point drag on adjusted operating income growth and a negative five-cent impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs such as severance-related charges.\nRelated to last week's announcement, FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion ahead of expectations and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year over year excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives. Gross margin percentage increased roughly one point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year over year to 68% excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased roughly two points even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting\nadjustments, integration, and transaction related cost from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction related costs. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly five points year over year to 44%, excluding the impact of the change\nin accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly six points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now to our segment results.\nRevenue from productivity and business processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better than expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency in line with expectations driven by healthy renewal, execution, and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum paid. Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year over year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker\nofferings offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to Cloud offerings.\nOffice consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to $78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better than expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business, bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environments in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business primarily in\nDynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased roughly one point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365.\nOperating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with five points of favorable impact from the prior year. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency ahead of expectations with better than expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and Cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other Cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant currency, including six points of growth from AI services, both AI and non-AI. Azure services drove our outperformance in our\nper user business. The enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier.\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end-of-support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across enterprise, support services, and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased roughly one point, driven by\nthe improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with nine points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency.\nNow, More Personal Computing revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall growth included 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance in higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows commercial products and Cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, primarily period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of\nexpectations, due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership.\nGaming revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations. A stronger than expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker than expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency, with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased\nroughly six points year over year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38%, with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by six points of favorable impact from the prior year.\nQ2 GAAP operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.5 billion lower than expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract. Shifting from Q2 to Q3, cash paid for PPE was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our Cloud demand inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69%, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year over year, reflecting the timing of cash paid for\nproperty and equipment this quarter. Other income and expense was in line with expectations at negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 18%, and finally we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First, FX based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than one point, and we expect no impact to COGS in operating expense growth in commercial bookings. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage\nshould decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change. Q3 Cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our Cloud and AI infrastructure and the slip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our Cloud infrastructure buildout. Next, to segment guidance in\nProductivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 to 19.6 billion, or growth between 10% and 12%.\nIn Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits driven by continued growth\nacross all businesses, and in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 to 26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%.\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth and constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 result. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low\nto mid single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-Cloud environments and in enterprise and partner services. Revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior-year comparable for enterprise support services and more.\nPersonal computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 to 15.1 billion, or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and Cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition. Depending on the mix of contracts in devices, revenue should decline in the low double digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products.\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits, about eight points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue driven by continued volume strength, and in gaming we expect revenue growth in the low 40s including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year over year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 to 18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of\nacquired intangible assets. From the Activision acquisition, we expect operating expense of $15.8 to 15.9 billion including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition.\nOther income and expense should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full year revenue growth by less than one point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full year COGS or operating expense growth. Second,\nActivision, for the full year FY24 we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income when excluding purchase accounting integration and transaction related cost at a total company level.\nWe delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our Cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and the substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to be up one to two points year over year even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion includes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful\nlives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution so our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A. Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the strong quarter, and thanks for letting me ask a question. Amy, you discussed Azure being stable, and you delivered Azure growth stability. If we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI continuing to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue and what is other is past revenue, that AI leveraging or driven by AI is difficult. Can you help me with two related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing, and at some point it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then? Do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish, or do we see a rebound\nas the Cloud shift continues and the need for data inferencing grows? Second part on AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to pick up in non-Microsoft inferencing kicking in? When do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYou want me to go first?\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nWhy don't you go first, and I'll take the more technical.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, let me just on the inferencing and training, what you're seeing for most part is all inferencing. None of the large model training stuff is in any of our Azure numbers at all. Small batch training, so somebody's doing fine tuning or what have you, that'll be there, but that's sort of a minor part. Most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly infrared. Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about like what is a new workload in AI. The new workload in AI, obviously in our case, starts with one of the frontier, I mean, starts with the frontier model, Azure OpenAI. It's not just about just one model, right? You first, you take that model, you do RLHF, you may do some fine tuning, you do\nretrieval, which means you're sort of either hitting some storage meter or you're using, creating some compute meters. By the way, you'll also distill a large model to a small model. That would be a training perhaps, but that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. I think that's what's happening. You could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a life cycle, which is they'll get rebuilt and they'll be continuously optimized over time. That's sort of one side, and I think, if you understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization? I think last quarter we said, one, we are going to continue to have these cycles where people will build\nnew workloads, they will optimize the workloads, and then they'll start new workloads. I think that that's what we continue to see. That period of massive, I'll call it optimization only, and no new workload, that I think has ended at this point. What you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both when it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nMaybe I'll just add just a few things to that. I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables, or the comparables easing, it's all sort of the same thing that we're getting to that point in H2. That's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reason Satya talked about. This is starting to see the application of AI at scale, and we want to be able to show people this is how that's going to look. It's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue. I do think about those as both related, and ultimately the TAM that we go after is best thought of as across both of those,\nboth AI workload and a, I guess, quote unquote, non-AI workload. Although to Satya's point, you need all of it.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you very much for the deep answer.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader Software Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon, Amy. The margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting in AI. I'm curious if you could just walk through how this is possible, what you're seeing so far, and some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams have obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that Q2, because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say is sort of a run rate margin improvement. Let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good, and it speaks of, I think, one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we want really to make sure when we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team it's on, is inclusive of AI enablement. Think about it as\nbuilding that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work, and I think that's important because it means you're shifting to an AI first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on day to day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There's also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products. We talked about it with Office 365, we talked about it in Azure Core, we even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. When\nyou take improvements at the gross margin level plus this consistency of repivoting a workforce toward the AI first work we're doing without adding material. Number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage, and we still need to be investing. The important part, invest toward the thing that's going to shape the next decade, and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. It's a great question, and hopefully that helps piece apart a few of the components.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader Software Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nThanks Amy.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Joe, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, thank you very much. Superb quarter, great improvements. Just one question for you, Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back. The nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, I think it's going to have a very, very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes everything from power, power density, to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator now is sort of the main.\nCPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. I think in the network memory architecture, all of it. The core computer architecture changes. I think every workload changes. Yeah, there's a full—like take our data layer. The most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI. Right. If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute, we'll have traditional SQL, we'll have Spark, and by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or that lakehouse pattern. The business model, you can combine all of those different computes.\nThat's the type of compute architecture. It's sort of a. That's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean, if you think about what, if you look at Copilot, Copilot extensibility with GPTs, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. Yeah, I mean, it definitely builds. I do believe being in the Cloud has been very helpful to build AI, but now AI is just redefining what it means to have what the Cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nTerrific. Thank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. Joe, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you. I wanted to return to AI. The six-point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU constrained, if the success you've had, maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other Cloud infrastructure providers have talked about a little bit, maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting. Thank you.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start. Satya, feel free to add on. Karl, I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen it scale through that process. That is going toward, as we talked about, servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward. I do feel like the teams have done a very good job. I feel like primarily, obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand.\nI tend to think looking forward to tend to see and I guided toward it accelerating capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters given what we see in terms of pipeline.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Joe, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. You know, the early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 Copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past? What, if anything, is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you for the question. A couple of things in my comments I said, at least in relation to our previous suites, like let's say E3 or E5, whatever, two months in, it's definitely much faster than that. From that perspective, it's exciting to see, I'll say the demand signal, the deployment signal I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right? I mean, it sort of shows up in your apps, you click on it like any ribbon thing, and it becomes a daily habit. In fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of back in the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of, I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue,\nright? Just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters, I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting if you look at the data we have. Summarization, that's what it's like. Number one, I'm doing summarizations of Teams meetings, inside our teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, meeting.\nWord documents, summarization. I get something in email, I'm summarizing. Summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. Anytime you want to start something, that blank page thing goes away, and you start by prompting and drafting chat. To me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications, now queryable by natural language in a powerful way. I can go and say what are all the things Amy said I should be watching out for next quarter, and it'll come out with great detail. Chat summarization, draft, also by the way, actions.\nOne of the most used things is here's the Word document, go complete. I mean, create a PowerPoint. Those are the stuff that's also beginning. I feel like these all become. Fundamentally what happens is if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work, work artifact, and workflow changed. You can imagine what forecasting was before Excel and email and what it was after. Similarly, you'll see work and work change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from your business. Those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nMaybe just to add two points, one of the exciting things as said, for some companies it's going to be standard issue like a PC. For other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains, and then expand. Being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month is really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too. The other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait, and then it gets deployed. After deployment, you want to see usage, and in particular, what we've seen, and you would expect this in some ways with Copilot, even in the early stages.\nObviously, deployment happens very quickly, but really what we're seeing is engagement grow. To Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes, you see engagement, engagement grow with time. I think those are just to put a pin in that because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft",
    "content2": "Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director Software Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much. Is it possible to unpack the six point AI services tailwind just to help us understand which elements ramped up by the three incremental points? For instance, is it more the OpenAI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other Copilots, the Azure OpenAI Service, third party LLMs running on Azure? I'm just wondering where did you see the strongest step up in that activity?\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nMark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as really it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API. Generally, that's the easiest way to think about it. We also saw growth in GitHub Copilot, which Satya talked about, and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some smaller ways for training. This is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number. How easy is it to think of it that way?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nAzure OpenAI and then OpenAI's own APIs on top of Azure would be the major drivers. There's a lot of this small batch training. That goes on, whether it's Auto Edge app or fine tuning, and then a lot of people who are starting to use models as with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure OpenAI today.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director Software Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Reback\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGreat, thanks very much, Amy. For many, many years in commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU. Over the last couple of quarters we're getting a convergence. Obviously, as the seat count gets really large as we look forward, should they run even for a period of time, or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThat's a great question, Brad. Let me split apart the components, and then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually, believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectories. I'll explain why I say that. Seat growth, as we talk about, is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-sized businesses and really frontline worker scenarios. To your point, on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but they're also new seats. You see that in the seat count number, and as we get through, we've seen that come down a little bit quarter over quarter, and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter. A very separate thing is being able to add\nARPU, and traditionally, and again this quarter, right. That's come over time from E3, then from E5, and we're continuing to see very healthy, sweet momentum, and you heard very good renewals. All of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. The next thing that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question, I'm trying to recall, is that you're going to see Copilot revenue will land there as ARPU, right. That won't show as seat growth. You'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot, all show up in ARPU over time, and then you'll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker, and maybe new industry scenarios. I tend to not\nreally, Brad, think about them as related lines. Believe it or not, I think about them as sort of unique, independent motions we run, and there's still room for seat growth, and obviously, obviously with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.\n\nBrad Reback\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Joe, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nTyler Radke\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst Software, Citi\n\nThanks for taking the question. Satya, your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing. Obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs in productivity for developers. How do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over time, and just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new releases there.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah, I mean it's. I always go back to my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different. It started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT and then its use inside of scenario with GitHub Copilot. Yes, I think this is the place where it's most evolved in terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits. You see it, we see it inside of Microsoft. We see it in all the case studies we put out of customers. Everybody at takt, it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer. It's like if you take away spell check from Word, I'll be unemployable. Similarly, it'll be like, I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development.\nThe thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked. You are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers. If I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they are pretty low, frankly. Even though we have had a lot of success, it's not like we are a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is whether it's Sales Copilot, Service Copilot, GitHub Copilot, or Security Copilot, they are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx. It's like two points, three points of OpEx leverage would go to some software spend. I think that that's a pretty straightforward value\nequation. That's the first time. I mean this is not something we been able to make the case for before, whereas now I think we have that case. Even the horizontal Copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level. Even there, you can make the same argument. Whatever ARPU we may even have with E5 now, you can say incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a Copilot to give you more time savings, for example? Yes, I think all up I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even, and their productivity and how we participate, and I think GitHub Copilot.\nI never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of companies spend on, let's say, development activity. Now you're seeing that transition. It's just not tools, it's about productivity of your dev team.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Tyler.\n\nTyler Radke\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst Software, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThat wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nEVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Iversen, please go ahead.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed Outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide Outlook commentary on today's call. Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard on 13 October 2023. We will share more on the expected impact of the Activision acquisition during the Outlook commentary portion of today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's Q1 performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we'll refer to the growth rate only. We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded.\nIf you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilot, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now, I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. We also have our AI services deployed in more regions than any other cloud provider.\nThis quarter, we announced the general availability of our next generation H100 virtual machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost, latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation, more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI Service, including new-to-Azure customers. We are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs, as leading AI startups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore making them Azure customers as well. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We are meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem, edge, and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers, up 140% year-over-year.\nWe are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless, fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. We are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Haines, Zeiss, and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data. In the age of Copilot, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estates. That's why, with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1,000 use three or more of our data solutions today. With Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytics solution with an all-inclusive business model.\nMore than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55% while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users, and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for Business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter, with significant traction outside the US. This quarter, we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC, to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. All up, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago.\nWe've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota, have all used Copilot and Power Platform to date. EY, for example, has enabled Copilot for all 170,000-plus Power Platform users at the company. This quarter, we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages, making it possible to build data-driven websites using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader in low-code, no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications. All up, Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications.\nWe are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot helps sellers at more than 15,000 organizations, including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas to faster access to valuable business data. This quarter, we introduced Copilot and Dynamics 365 Field Service to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date. With DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout.\nFor example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast US, credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We're also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world. Now on to future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams.\nTens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it, and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using Chat. The new Copilot Lab helps employees build their own work habits for this era of AI by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling.\nThis quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to 2x faster while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We have seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams Store and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian, and Workday, each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations. With Skills in Viva, we are bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work.\nAll up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across private and public sector, including Cerebras, Chanel, DXC Technology, all rely on our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. The PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels. We continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever with 150 new features, including new AI-powered experiences like Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos. We introduced Copilot in Windows, the everyday AI companion which incorporates the context of the web, your work data, and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Cantor, and RBC.\nFinally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we are making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, and the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled, and security is the number one priority for CIOs worldwide. We see high demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations, including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta, have been using Copilot in preview, and early feedback has been positive.\nWe look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program so they can improve the productivity of their own security operations centers and stop threats at machine speed. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, now has more than 25,000 customers, and revenue surpassed $1 billion annual run rate. Customers in every industry, like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton, and MetLife, use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell, and get hired. Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row.\nThis quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including a learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines and tools to help employers find qualified candidates, sellers, and marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, 3/4 of them say it saved them time. We have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year, and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search advertising and news. With our Copilot for the web, we are redefining how people use the internet to search and create.\nBing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers as well as support for DALL-E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images. More than 1.8 billion images have been created today. And with our Copilot in shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketers to customer intent and chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming.\nWe were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim. More than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC, and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard, we now add significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War.\nWe're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations. I encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year.\nResults exceeded expectations, and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5, and growth of new business continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected, the optimization trends were similar to Q4. Higher than expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. In our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend landed roughly in line with our expectations, and in gaming, strong engagement, helped by the Starfield launch, benefited Xbox content and services.\nCommercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 18% to $212 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 20%. This quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency ahead of expectations.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvement in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure, as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly three points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365, as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected, due to cost efficiency focus, as well as investments that shifted to future quarters.\nOperating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly five points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly six points, driven by improved operating levers through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency.\nOffice 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with a bit more end-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, with continued impact from the growth trends and new standalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17% in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8% ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better than expected performance across all businesses.\nGrowth was driven by talent solutions, though we continued to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly one point, driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 2%, and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better than expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%.\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly three points from AI services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better than expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher than expected growth in our per-user business. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security install base grew 11% to over 259 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends and new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end-of-support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected performance in enterprise support services.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency. Operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better than expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5.\nDevices revenue decreased 22% ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue XTAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. In gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass, as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly five points year-over-year, driven primarily by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses.\nOperating expenses declined 1%, and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis.\nThe Activision acquisition closed on 13 October 2023, so my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately one point. We expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motion, including healthy renewals, but growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be relatively flat year-over-year.\nExcluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly one point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-up. Next to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12%, or $18.8 to 19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately one point lower. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5.\nWe expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on 1 November and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits, driven by talent solutions and marketing solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environments for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. In Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18%, or $25.1 to 25.4 billion.\nRevenue growth in constant currency will be approximately one point lower. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from end-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue, and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat, with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline low to mid single digits. Now to more personal computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 to 16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid to high single digits, with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid teens as we continue to focus on our higher margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low to mid teens.\nSearch and news advertising XTAC revenue growth should be mid single digits, with roughly four points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. Reminder that this XTAC growth will be roughly four points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which, as a reminder, includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid to high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance.\nWe expect COGS between $19.4 to 19.6 billion US dollars, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.5 to 15.6 billion US dollars, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2, as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX.\nAssuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full-year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth by one point. Second, Activision. We expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For our full FY 2024, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity, while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full-year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year.\nIn closing, with our strong start to FY24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please ask only one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys.\nOne moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing, and the new products are garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment that remains volatile, I bet, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this. One, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year, or is the environment too tricky for that?\nAnd then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low and was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nMaybe I can start, Keith, and Amy can add to it. Overall, there are multiple things, Keith, that are all happening, obviously, simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize where the growth for Azure is coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. For example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement.\nOnce we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlocks from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. Second thing, of course, is the workload start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start. And that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme, perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts that aren't AI.\nGiven our leadership position, we are seeing complete new project starts, which are AI projects. As you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters. They have lots of other cloud meters as well. That sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side. Obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence, and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. We are in the very, very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nKeith, maybe just a few things to add, and then I'll talk a little bit about the operating leverage, which is the second part of your question. In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where SOCU went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings, so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios. I think that is an important piece as you think about stability and commercial demand.\nThen if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full-year guidance that now, even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements we're making in Azure and even Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we're delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see. And although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave.\nSo I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, given your guidance for Azure this quarter. While you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI DevStack, Copilot reference architecture, and plugin architecture been a meaningful factor, not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us any color on whether Azure GPUs predominantly model training, or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nNo, thank you for the question, Mark.\nYeah, it is true that the approach we have taken is a full-stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing Chat or all our Copilots. All share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used, which we trained, and then the one model that we're doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see that sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are writing is much higher up than low-level kernels, if you will.\nSo therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot Stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open-source models or proprietary models. We also have a bunch of open-source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds of ways people use it, but the thing is we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nAnd the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means even beyond the point Satya made is that when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. I mean, one other thing\nI'd just add to perhaps Mark's question, as well as Keith's, is this platform transition, I think, is very important for us to be very disciplined on both our tech stack as well as our capital spend, all to be concentrated. The lesson learned from the cloud side is we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses. It's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio.\nThat, I think, is going to be very important because that discipline, given what the spend will look like for the AI transition, any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, SVP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\n. Extremely helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader of Software and Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nThanks, Amy. Good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking, can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with a stronger AI boost coming in the next several quarters?\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nI think looking at our, as I said, Q1 was a strong start to the year. Q2 certainly implies that. We've talked about stability for Azure into the second half of the year, looking at and in line with what we're seeing for Q2.\nAnd so I think we feel good about our ability to execute, but more importantly, our ability to continue to take share.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the office space with the Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about what you're seeing there in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were with the special features there? And what does it mean in terms of adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA and 1 November? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThanks for the question, Raimo. The good news is twofold. One is the fact that what, 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product.\nI think you all have also done lots of checks. The feedback is very, very positive. In fact, the interesting thing is it's not any one tool, right, which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all-up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to do analysis, or PowerPoint, Outlook, or Teams. That clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, right? It's not just a dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. So we are seeing broad usage across.\nThe interesting thing is by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales, by roles, we are seeing productivity gains like we saw with developers in GitHub Copilot. So that's the data. We are very excited about our Ignite conference where we will talk a lot more about all of the use cases, where's the value, and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far, so good as far as the data is and the feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product. I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp. And it's incrementally priced. So therefore, not all will apply still. But at least for something completely new, to have this level of usage already and this level of excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, Amy. Congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth. That's terrific. I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a one- to two-point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the second half of your fiscal year if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued core ex-AI Azure spend optimization continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it. Thanks so much.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. A couple of things.\nAs I talked about Q2 and then into H2, we've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers, are they going to continue to do that? It's an important part of running workloads. That is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated. But that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. So I think that impact remains through the rest of the year. My view is unchanged on that. Then, of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts.\nAt the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. Primarily, we're expecting those to come from AI workloads. But AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services, and they use other things. So that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution. We feel good about taking share, and we feel good about consistent trends. So I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director of Software Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Terrific. Thanks.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, wonderful. Thanks so much.\nVery impressive to see the Office 365 commercial seat growth hanging in here in that double-digit range. It's very impressive just given the scale of that business. We think of Office as having such a dominant market position. Curious how you think about where that seat is coming from and how many more of those seats are out there to go get.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft",
    "content2": "Thanks for that question. And maybe I'll take that, Satya, if you want to add. In general, our seat growth does come from all segments, but with a particular strength in small and mid-sized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity. And that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters, where the majority of our seat growth has gone.\nWhile obviously it's slowed a bit, to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 means. It's more applicable to more people. And so I think many people have thought, \"Oh my goodness, you've got a lot of customers already.\" And we look and say, \"How many people, when you expand what Microsoft 365 means, whether it's security, or it means analytics, or it means Teams, it means lots of things in an expanding definition, it applies to more types of workers.\" And frankly, the value is such, especially on the small business front, where it's to the point where I think people feel like it's a great way to spend. Even the spend money they have is this remains a pretty compelling offer.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Equity Capital Markets, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the Intelligent Cloud segment operating margins. These came in, I think, at the highest level in six years despite elevated AI investments. Was there a one-time tailwind here that helped, or are you at the point where Azure has got to come to the scale where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks for that question. I think there are a couple of things going on. And I would say, in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it absolutely is a help to operating leverage. The second component of that is in our core Azure business.\nThe team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that. And so that's been helpful as well. And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment to make sure we're focusing that work on leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so you're right. Even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it'll also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin. But this does have a slightly, as I talked about earlier, easier comp in Q1 and Q2, given it was some of our highest growth operating expense quarters in our company's history a year ago.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Equity Capital Markets, Piper Sandler\n\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Enterprise Software Analyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Thank you very much for taking the question. And maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about, but on the gross margin line, Amy, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin's up 2.0 over the year, excluding the useful life change. A little more improvement than we've seen in some time. And some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction given increased AI investments. And so as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher CapEx will filter into the model? Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nLet me break that into two components because they're both important, and it's a really good question, Gregg.\nOn our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 business, Dynamics business, they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so that, like in other quarters, has helped this quarter. In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it. If you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers, that every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue. Or on our Bing workloads, I mean, I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame.\nWhen you think about our investment in AI, yes, because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue. I think on occasion, you may see something tick up one or two points and the other one not quite get there. But the point is it's going to be very well paired because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nI'll just add that it'll be very well paired at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do too.\nAt the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to utilization is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Enterprise Software Analyst, Mizuho\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Gregg. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you very much, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. The Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, up 27% in constant currency, with Azure all-up accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time. Every customer I speak with is asking not only how, but how fast they can apply next-generation AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face, and to do so safely and responsibly. To that end, we remain focused on three key priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI platform shift by infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack. And third, driving operating leverage. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.\nAzure continues to take share as customers migrate their existing workloads and invest in new ones. We continue to see more cloud migrations as it remains early when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity. We're also seeing increasing momentum with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers, up 150% year over year, including Carnival Corp, Domino's, and Thermo Fisher. Azure AI is ushering in new born-in-the-cloud AI-first workloads with the best selection of frontier and open models, including Meta's recent announcement supporting Llama on Azure and Windows, as well as OpenAI. We have great momentum across Azure OpenAI Service, more than 11,000 organizations across industries, including IKEA, Volvo Group, Zurich Insurance, as well as digital natives like Flipkart, Humane, Kahoot, Miro, and Typeface use the service. That's nearly 100 new customers added every day this quarter.\nMercedes-Benz, for example, is bringing ChatGPT via Azure OpenAI to more than 900,000 vehicles in the United States, making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive. Moody's built its own internal copilot to improve productivity of its 14,000 employees. We're also partnering broadly to scale this next generation of AI to more customers. Snowflake, for example, will increase its Azure spend as it builds new integrations with Azure OpenAI. KPMG has announced a multi-billion dollar commitment to our cloud and AI services to transform professional services. Now on to data. Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our intelligent data platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate.\nWe introduced Microsoft Fabric this quarter, which unifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model. One month in, we are encouraged by early interest and usage. Over 8,000 customers have signed up to trial the service and are actively using it, and over 50% are using four or more workloads. All up, we once again took share with our analytics solutions, with customers like Bridgestone, Chevron, and Equinor turning to our stack. Now on to developers. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy models, and do so responsibly. VS Code and GitHub Copilot are category-leading products when it comes to how developers code every day. Nearly 90% of GitHub Copilot sign-ups are self-service, indicating strong organic interest and pull-through.\nMore than 27,000 organizations, up 2x quarter over quarter, have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business to increase the productivity of their developers, including Airbnb, Dell, and Scandinavian Airlines. We're also applying AI across low-code, no-code toolchain to help domain experts automate workflows, create apps and web pages, build virtual agents, or analyze data using just natural language. Copilot in Power BI combines the power of large language models with an organization's data to generate insights faster, and Copilot in Power Pages makes it easier to create secure low-code business websites. One of our tools that's really taken off is Copilot in Power Virtual Agents, which is delivering one of the biggest benefits of this new era of AI, helping customer service agents be significantly more productive.\nHP and Virgin Money, for example, have both built custom chatbots with Copilot and Power Virtual Agents that were trained to answer complex customer inquiries. All up, more than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 75% quarter over quarter. Finally, Power Automate now has 10 million monthly active users at companies like Jaguar, Land Rover, Repsol, and Rolls-Royce, up 55% year over year. We're going further with new process mining capabilities in Power Automate, which are helping organizations optimize business processes and, in turn, build their AI advantage. Now on to business applications. We are taking share in every category as we help organizations across the private and public sector, from Avis to Albertsons to Breville to Equinox, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, transform their mission-critical business processes.\nAll up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience, service and finance, and supply chain businesses, all surpassing $1 billion in annual sales. This quarter, we brought Dynamics 365 Copilot to our ERP portfolio, including finance, project operations, and supply management. And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can ground their customer interactions with data from CRM systems, including both Salesforce and Dynamics, to personalize customer interactions and close more deals. Now on to our industry and cross-industry clouds. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is helping customers like Costco, Land O'Lakes, and REI take action to meet their environmental goals. And in healthcare, hundreds of organizations are using our Nuance DAX Ambient Intelligence solution to automatically document patient encounters at the point of care.\nThis quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Epic to integrate Nuance DAX Express directly into their industry-leading EHR system. Now on to future work. Across industries, customers like Ahold Delhaize, Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Siemens, and Wells Fargo are choosing Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice, and analytics value. Four months ago, we introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot. We are now rolling out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 600 paid customers through our early access program. Feedback from organizations like Emirates NBD, General Motors, Goodyear, and Lumen is that it's a game changer for employee productivity. We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calling.\nWe now have more than 1,900 apps in Teams App Store, and companies in every industry, from British Airways to Dentsu to Eli Lilly and Manulife, have built over 145,000 custom line-of-business apps, bringing business processes directly into the flow of work. Five months in, Teams Premium has already surpassed 600,000 seats as companies like BNY Mellon, Clifford Chance, PepsiCo, and Starbucks chose the add-on for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling with more than 17 million PSTN users, up 45% year over year. Teams Rooms is used by more than 70% of the Fortune 500, including L'Oréal, United Airlines, and U.S. Bank, and revenue more than doubled year over year this quarter. And with Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new market category for employee experience.\nViva now has 35 million monthly active users as companies like CBRE, Fujitsu, and Unisys turn to the platform to build data-driven, high-performance organizations. Now on to Windows. The number of devices running Windows 11 has more than doubled in the last year, and we are seeing continued growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments worldwide by companies like AT&T, Krones, and Westpac. We're also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed for enterprise customers with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months. Enbridge, Eurowings, Marriott International, and TD Bank Group, for example, all chose cloud-delivered Windows this quarter. Windows 11 is also rapidly becoming a powerful new canvas in this new era of AI.\nWe introduced Windows Copilot this quarter, helping every Windows 11 user become a power user with just natural language, and are excited to put it in the hands of more people in the coming months. Now on to security. More than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms, up 26% year over year. More than 60%, including leading enterprises like ABN AMRO, Dow, and Heineken, use four or more of our security products, up 33% year over year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. We once again took share across all major categories we serve as we innovate to protect customers.\nIn identity, Microsoft Entra ID has more than 610 million monthly active users, and we are adding SSE to our Entra product family to complement our leading identity solution and secure access to any app or resource from anywhere. Finally, our Security Copilot, the first product to apply this next generation of AI to SecOps, will be available to customers via a paid early access program this fall. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn's revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, and membership growth has now accelerated for eight quarters in a row, a testament to how mission-critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired. Our talent solutions business surpassed $7 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months, and our hiring business took share for the fourth consecutive quarter.\nWe continue to use AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into experiences of experts on the platform. Our AI-powered collaborative articles are now the fastest-growing traffic driver in LinkedIn. And finally, we are helping LinkedIn stay trusted and authentic. More than 7 million members have verified who they are or where they work, many using new integrations with Microsoft Entra as well as Clear and HyperVerge. Now on to search, advertising, and news. While it's early in our journey, we are reshaping daily search and web habits with our copilot for the web. This quarter, we introduced new AI-powered features, including multimodal capabilities with visual search and Bing Chat. We're expanding to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of this next generation of AI today.\nBing is also the default search experience for OpenAI's ChatGPT, bringing timelier answers with links to our reputable sources to ChatGPT users. To date, Bing users have engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images with Bing Image Creator, and Microsoft Edge took share for the ninth consecutive quarter. More broadly, we are growing our ad network, which is now available in 187 markets, spanning search, display, native, retail media, video, and connected TV. Now on to gaming. Last week, we extended our Activision Blizzard merger agreement deadline to October. We continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done. We are committed to bringing more games to more players everywhere. Great content is key to our approach, and our pipeline has never been stronger.\nWe announced our most ambitious lineup of games ever at our showcase last month, including 21 titles that will be available via Xbox Game Pass. We're looking forward to the release of Starfield this fall, Bethesda's first new universe in 25 years. All up, we set new fourth-quarter highs for monthly active users driven by strength off-console as well as monthly active devices. We saw record fourth-quarter engagement across Game Pass, with hours played up 22% year over year. Just last week, we announced Game Pass Core, bringing together online play from Xbox Live and content from Game Pass into a single offering. In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We continue to innovate across the tech stack to help our customers thrive in the new era of AI. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.This quarter, revenue was $56.2 billion, up 8% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.69 and increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, results exceeded expectations with focused execution by our sales and partner teams. These execution efforts led to share gains again this quarter in Azure, Dynamics, Security, and Edge. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy renewal strength, which includes our upsell and attach motions, particularly with Microsoft 365 E5. Growth of new business continued to be moderated for products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite, including standalone Office 365, EMS, and Windows commercial products. As expected in Azure, we saw a continuation of the optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter.\nIn our consumer business, the PC market overall was in line with expectations, although the early timing of back-to-school inventory builds benefited Windows OEM. Advertising spend was slightly lower than anticipated, which impacted search and news advertising, and LinkedIn marketing solutions. Commercial bookings decreased 2% and 1% in constant currency, in line with expectations against a prior year comparable that was our largest commercial bookings quarter ever. In addition to the healthy execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier, we saw a record number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. The average annualized value for our large long-term Azure contracts was the highest it's ever been, driven by customer demand for our innovative cloud solutions today, as well as interest in AI opportunities ahead. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 19% and 18% in constant currency to $224 billion.\nRoughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 13% year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 22%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by one point, one point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $30.3 billion and grew 21% and 23% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly three points year over year to 72%, also slightly ahead of expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, including two points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year over year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expense increased 2% in line with expectations, as savings across the company from our focus on prioritization and efficiency were offset by the charge related to the Irish Data Protection Commission matter. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was flat compared to a year ago. Operating income increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, including four points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 4 points year over year to 43%.\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly two points, driven by improved operating leverage through disciplined cost management. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $18.3 billion and grew 10% and 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial, partially offset by LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, a bit better than expected, with particular strength in E5 upsell at renewal noted earlier. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year over year, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with better-than-expected transactional purchasing.\nOffice consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 67 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in talent solutions, with some continued bookings impact from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Growth was partially offset by a decline in marketing solutions due to the lower ad spend noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 26% and 28% in constant currency, with continued healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365.\nOperating expenses decreased slightly, and operating income increased 25% and 29% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24 billion, increasing 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 18% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 26% and 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services, as expected. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security install base grew 11% to over 256 million seats, with impact from the continued growth trends in new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by a slight decrease in new annuity contracts, which carry higher end-period revenue recognition.\nEnterprise services revenue grew 4% and 5% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 10%. Operating income grew 20% and 22% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $13.9 billion, decreasing 4% and 3% in constant currency above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in Windows, partially offset by gaming. Windows OEM revenue decreased 12% year over year ahead of expectations due to 7 points of benefit from early back-to-school inventory builds, while the overall PC market was as expected.\nDevices revenue decreased 20% and 18% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to the renewal strength noted earlier, even with the moderated growth of new business and standalone offerings. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 8%, a bit behind expectations due to the lower ad spend noted earlier. Higher search volumes, share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser, and the benefit from the Xandr acquisition were partially offset by the impact from third-party partnerships. Gaming revenue increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, lower than expected due to weakness in first-party and third-party content performance. Xbox content and services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, and Xbox hardware revenue declined 13%.\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 2% and were relatively unchanged in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 9% and 8% in constant currency. Operating income increased 4% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $10.7 billion to support cloud demand, including investments in AI infrastructure. Kash paid for PP&E was $8.9 billion. Kash flow from operations was $28.8 billion, up 17% year over year, as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Free cash flow was $19.8 billion, up 12% year over year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 22%, and free cash flow increased 19%.\nThis quarter, other income and expense was $473 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash return to our shareholders to over $38 billion for the full fiscal year. Now let's turn to next fiscal year and start with a few reminders. First, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $3.7 billion of depreciation expense shifting from FY23 to future periods. Our FY23 operating income and margins benefited from this change in accounting estimate, and that will be a headwind to growth in FY24 as the benefit reduces to $2.1 billion. Next, my outlook commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise.\nMy outlook does not include any impact from the Activision acquisition, which we continue to work towards closing, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now for some thoughts on the full year of FY24. With the weaker US dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth by approximately 1 point, with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. The impact in H1 is expected to be greater than H2. At a total company level, revenue growth from our commercial business will continue to be driven by the Microsoft Cloud and will again outpace the growth from our consumer business. Even with strong demand and a leadership position, growth from our AI services will be gradual as Azure AI scales and our copilots reach general availability dates. For FY24, the impact will be weighted towards H2.\nTo support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially each quarter through the year as we scale to meet demand signals. We are committed to driving operating leverage, and therefore we will manage our total cost growth across COGS and operating expense in line with the demand signals we see, as well as revenue growth. Increased capital spend will drive higher COGS growth than in FY23, and FY24 operating expense growth will remain low as we prioritize our spend. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to remain flat year over year, even with the headwind from the change in accounting estimate. And finally, we expect our FY24 tax rate to be around 19%. Now to the outlook for Q1. First, FX.\nBased on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point, with no impact to COGS growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth in Intelligent Cloud by 1 point, with no impact to Productivity and Business Processes or More Personal Computing. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including our renewal and upsell motions, along with long-term Azure commitments, should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year over year, driven by the accounting estimate change headwind noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q1 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, as noted earlier, driven by investments in our AI infrastructure. Reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, the segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11%, or $18 to $18.3 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits.\nEven with share gains in our hiring business, growth will continue to be impacted by the overall markets for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. In Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16%, or 14% and 15% in constant currency. Revenue should be $23.3 billion to $23.6 billion US dollars. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from end-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 25% to 26% in constant currency, including roughly 2 points from all Azure AI services.\nGrowth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q4 to continue into Q1. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the install base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits against a prior comparable that benefited from annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. In enterprise services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits year over year, as growth in enterprise support services will be more than offset by a decline in industry solutions. In more personal computing, we expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $12.9 billion.\nWindows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-teens, including 5 points of negative impact from the earlier back-to-school inventory builds that were pulled into the fourth quarter. Our guide assumes no significant changes to the PC demand environment. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-30s due to the overall PC market and adjustments we made in our portfolio, with an increased focus on our higher margin premium products. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid to high single digits. Search and news advertising ex tax revenue growth should be mid to high single digits, roughly 5 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains. Growth will continue to be impacted by the advertising spend environment and third-party partnerships mentioned earlier.\nWe continue to be excited by Bing usage signals and a longer-term opportunity as we invest in AI. In gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits, driven by first-party and third-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion US dollars and operating expense of $13.5 billion to $13.6 billion US dollars. Together, total cost growth should be around 6%. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Two reminders. This does not include any impact from Activision on interest income and expense, and we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\nWe expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be around 19%. And finally, as a reminder for Q1 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.7 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA Transition Tax. We do not expect a payment related to the R&D Capitalization provision in Q1. In closing, as a company, we delivered on the FY23 financial commitments we discussed a year ago on revenue and operating margin. A focus on operational excellence allowed us to achieve these targets while we delivered near-term value to customers and prioritized our investments to continue to lead in the future. As we start FY24, we are excited for the opportunities ahead and remain focused on delivering the three key priorities Satya mentioned. We'll maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud by helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud.\nWe'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure while scaling with growing demand so we can lead the AI platform wave. And finally, we'll align our cost with growth as we are committed to driving operating leverage. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instruction?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, Satya. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and for a very nice end to a great fiscal year. Satya, you started your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What's the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it? And then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there's going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these, but what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value out of generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For example, GitHub Copilot, in some sense, is sort of the no-brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization, whether you're a bank, you're a retailer, or you're a software company. It applies to everyone. So that's probably one of the things that we have seen very good, even productivity data and great adoption. And then obviously the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot.\nSo first thing we sort of talk about is how we ourselves are deploying all these Copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot. How do you get maximum value out of these horizontal tool chain? And then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, which we talked at our developer conference called the Copilot Stack. And then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for someone like Moody's to build their own Copilot for their people. So to us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI and with speed, if you will. And so those are the two things that we ask them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage.\nThen we even swarm with our own resources to help them get those things done. The last comment I'd make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this because I think the diffusion cycle here is, in some sense, we have a new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. So those would be the observations.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nTo your question, Keith, on gross margins and how I think about those going forward, the first thing I would say is I expect gross margins here to transition over time just like they did in the prior cloud transition. I would also say I expect workloads and the gross margins of the workloads to be different, just like they are in the cloud today.\nI would also add one thing that's different than last time. We talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a shared platform, which allows us to scale those gross margins a bit faster than last time. We do expect, as you asked and Satya talked about, the pace of this adoption curve, we do expect to be faster. You're seeing the CapEx spend accelerate in Q4 and then again in Q1, and we've talked about what it should look like the rest of the year. Now, that being said, we're talking about all that and going through that transition while delivering in FY2024 over FY2023, effectively a point higher operating margins.\nBecause if it's flat year over year, as we guided, with the headwind from the useful life change, when you correct for that, it's about a point higher. So I think the real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve and focusing on the transition, growth, and gross margins and delivering the operating leverage. Excellent.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Satya, on the optimization headwinds that you continue to see, when do you think we hit peak optimization? Are we getting close to hitting that peak and getting some relief in the back half of the year, maybe AI helping provide as a tailwind? Any color from what you're seeing from your perspective would be helpful.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nSure, Brent. Thank you for the question.\nYeah, a couple of observations. One is I think overall in the cloud, you do see new project starts, and then those project starts get optimized. And then you sort of time series all of that, and that's sort of what you see in the normal course. What happened here was during the pandemic, obviously there were lots of new project starts, and optimization in some sense was postponed. And that's where you're seeing, I'll call it, catch-up optimization. And that's something that, to your point, we will lap going into the next couple of quarters. I think it will come down. And we are seeing new project starts, both traditional type of project starts, even cloud migrations, data applications, and of course, obviously the AI applications.\nBut we'll get back to, I'll call it, the normal pace of new project starts and optimizations going forward, but we will cycle through, I think, in the next couple of quarters what is the last catch-up optimization.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nI would just add, Brent, I think to Satya's point, and maybe to build a bit of a line for you, I think it felt very similar to last quarter where we made the same comments, which is we're seeing sort of the normal optimization, plus we're seeing new workload starts across these workloads Satya talked about. And I think that's what we're saying going forward. And really what the change is just that lapping of, I think, a bit of the catch-up from a year ago. And you're right, we'll continue to do that through H2.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director and SVP, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Amy, CapEx moved up significantly Q over Q and year over year, and it's increasing moving forward. Can you give us some color? Is it physical data centers? Is it predominantly servers? Is it predominantly AI-driven? How should we think about the useful life of it? And then quickly for Satya, can you give us some somewhere we are on the status on the general availability of the full Copilot development stack and how long it's taking clients and partners to build Copilots? Thanks. Well, I'll start on the CapEx question, Satya, and I'll turn it over to you.\nMark, really, first of all, both in Q4 and then talking about Q1, the acceleration is really quite broad.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nIt's both on both the data centers and the physical basis, plus CPUs and GPUs and networking equipment. Think of it in a broad sense as opposed to a narrow sense. So it's overall increases of acceleration of overall capacity. And I think if you look back over really FY23, you wouldn't have seen some of the pace on normal, what I would say, capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workloads. So you're seeing both accelerations, the normal Azure workloads, plus some of the AI workloads is partially the reason. So it's why I do comment quite often that it's both overall commercial cloud demand and building out capacity for AI. It's both.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. And I think just for perspective, I think it's sort of always good to think about it where we have about $111 billion commercial cloud business growing at, whatever, 22% year over year.\nAnd then you had a CapEx growth, which is around the same number, 23% to 24%. So in some sense, it's sort of replacement capital plus some new capital that is going to drive new growth. So that's, I think, the scale. And we feel good about that structure of overall growth rates and how it translates into future TAM opportunity for us. And to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot stack is available today on Azure. So we have everything from Azure AI tool chain where you can use obviously Azure OpenAI, or even you can use open models from Llama and other Hugging Face models.\nYou have all the Fabric and all of our operational data stores for what is one of the most useful patterns around generative AI, which is what is called Retrieval Augmented Generation. That is, you take the data that you have in the data stores, use it in a prompt to generate completions, summaries, what have you. So that's something that we've seen a lot of, and the Copilots are fundamentally orchestrations of that. We have all of these services available. The thing that's fascinating is when you use something like Power Virtual Agents, you have a low-code, no-code tool to build effectively these AI products or full-fledged Copilots like we've built. All of the underlying primitives for that are available on Azure. The toolchain is available on Azure.\nAnd the speed with which customers are able to deploy them, ISVs are able to build them is pretty impressive.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director and SVP, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you. I appreciate it.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. If I could, I just wanted to get your thoughts to shift the discussion away from COGS and CapEx to more of the top-line outlook. It looks like Azure growth rate is definitely starting to stabilize, and generative AI contribution to Azure is measurably improving quarter by quarter. And optimization in a broader sense is also starting to settle down. Where does this leave with the company's outlook for Azure growth rate in the future quarters?\nAre we at a point where we've bottomed out and we could start to see some acceleration due to the trends we discussed? And also, if you take the superset of Microsoft Cloud, when you throw in the new pricing for Copilot, it certainly looks like the TAMs are opening up in a pretty significant way. So when you take that broader lens, that 21%, 22% growth rate that Satya and Amy referred to, what could be the outlook? Could we be too optimistic and entertaining hopes of some kind of acceleration in the years ahead, or how do you think about the outlook on the top line? Thank you so much.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nSure. Kash, thanks for the question. So maybe I'll start, and then Amy, you can add. Because I think we do think about what's the long-term TAM here, right?\nI mean, you heard me talk about this as a percentage of GDP, what's going to be tech spend. If you believe that, let's say, the 5% of GDP is going to go to 10% of GDP, maybe that gets accelerated because of the AI wave. The question is how much of that goes to the various parts of our commercial cloud, and then how competitive are we in each layer, right? If you sort of break it down, you talked about how with Microsoft 365, we think of this Copilot as a third pillar, right? We had the creation tools. We then had all the communication and collaboration services, and we think the AI Copilot is a third pillar. We're excited about it. Amy talked about how we want to get it out first as part of this preview.\nAnd then in the second half of the next fiscal year, we'll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it. So we're looking forward to it. But we think of it long-term as a third pillar, like we thought about something like, say, Teams or SharePoint back in the day or what have you. Then Azure, the way I think about it is we still are, whatever, inning two or inning three of even the cloud migration, especially if you view it, right, whether by industry moves to the cloud, segment moves to the cloud, as well as country adoption of the cloud, right? So there's still early innings of the cloud migration itself. So there's a lot there still. And then on top of that, there is this complete new world of AI driving a set of new workloads.\nSo we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM opportunity, and we'll play it out. But at the same time, as we are a $111 billion commercial cloud that has grown in 20s. So therefore, we do hit law of large numbers. But that said, we do think that this is a business that can have sustained high growth, which is something that we're excited about.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nI think the only thing, Kash, I would add is I think in some ways, what we're really pointing to is there's a process here. We see the demand signals quite strong. It remains strong. I'm thrilled with all the product announcements we've made. I'm thrilled with them moving to pre-review and then moving to GA. They absolutely are expansive in terms of addressable market.\nThey reach new budget pools is almost the way I talk about it a lot in terms of how CIOs or CFOs that I talk to think about that investment. So a growing opportunity. And as you know, we're focused on executing against that. And then revenue is an outcome. But it certainly does require the demand signal, requires the capital expense, and then creates the opportunity. And that's why I think in some ways we're spending a little more time talking about some of that investment is because it is the demand signal. Awesome.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed. Okay, great.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director, UBS",
    "content2": "Amy, if I could double-click a little bit on the exciting news around M365 Copilot, as everybody on the line looks to layer that opportunity into our models, I just wanted to get your views. Are there any guardrails you'd offer us to sort of keep us in line? Is there a degree of gross margin pressure in the office segment? In other words, is it a fairly cost-intensive new product that we should keep in mind? And also, could it pull along Azure in the sense that you need Azure AD and perhaps some of the other cybersecurity products? So a little color there might help everybody with their modeling exercise tonight and in the coming weeks.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nCFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. I think maybe I'll first start with the process we have when we release new products.\nI absolutely understand we are excited too by the demand signal, the customer reaction, really the requests we're getting to be in the paid preview. It's all encouraging. As you know, last week we announced pricing. Then we'll continue to work through the paid preview process, get good feedback. Then we'll announce the general availability date. Then we'll get to the GA date. Then we'll, of course, be able to sell it and then recognize revenue. And that is why I continue to say that I am just as excited as everyone else about this. And it should be more H2-weighted. And we've, I think, given you some sizing opportunities, and I think I would use all that. But I do think this is really about pacing.\nAnd of course, we've still got to get our Security Copilot and some of the Dynamics workloads priced and released, and we'll continue to work toward that. And of course, I think one of the things that people often, I think, overlook is, and Satya mentioned it briefly when you go back to the pull along Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure because it's not just the AI solution services that you need to build an app. And so it's less about Microsoft 365 pulling it along or any one Copilot. It's that when you're building these, it requires data and it requires the AI services. So you'll see them pull both core Azure and AI Azure along with them. And I think that's an important nuance as well. Yeah.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nIf I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the Copilots. You see that today when people build applications in Teams that are built on Power Apps, and those Power Apps happen to use something like SQL DB on Azure. That's like a classic line of business extension. So you'll see the same thing. When I have a Copilot plug-in, that plug-in uses Azure AI, Azure Meters, Azure Data Sources, Azure Semantic Search. So you'll see, obviously, a pull-through not only on the identity or security layer, but in the core path services of Azure plus the Copilot extensibility in M365.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nTerrific. Thank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Yes.\nThank you very much. Satya, there's so much evidence now that GitHub Copilot is boosting developer productivity by 40% to 50% or more, and it's resulting in higher quality code. Do you envision a similar level of productivity boost for the Microsoft 365 Copilots or the Security Copilot or the Sales Copilot? In other words, can every room of the house be remodeled to a similar extent such that that value proposition is pretty elevated across the entire stack?\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nYeah. Judson Althoff, we'd love you for having used his metaphor of remodeling every room of the house with AI. Because you're absolutely right. I mean, that's the opportunity we see. I think what you're also referencing is now there is good empirical evidence and data around the GitHub Copilot and the productivity stats around it. And we're actively working on that for M365 Copilot.\nAlso for things like the role-based ones like Sales Copilot or Service Copilot, we see these business processes having very high productivity gains. And so, yes, over the course of the year, we will have all of that evidence. And I think at the end of the day, as Amy referenced, every CFO and CIO is also going to take a look at this. I do think for the first time, or rather, I do think people are going to look at how can they complement their OpEx spend with essentially these Copilots in order to drive more efficiency and, quite frankly, even reduce the burden and drudgery of work on their OpEx and their people and so on. So therefore, I think you're going to see all of that translated into productivity stats, and we're looking forward to getting that data out.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a multi-part. You mentioned a couple of times that with the AI workload adoption that you're seeing on Azure, it's starting to look maybe a little bit different from an incremental share gain perspective versus previous. Can you maybe expand upon that? How should that drive core Azure consumption, particularly as we get through the year? And do you see a scenario where either the combination of lapping the optimization headwind plus the AI contribution plus this incremental tailwind that you're seeing around the workloads actually does drive a re-acceleration in Azure, particularly in the second half when you're going to start to see some of those things kick in? Yeah.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nI mean, the thing that we are both seeing and excited about is both the new workloads. I mean, if you think about Azure, we have grown Azure over the years coming from behind. Here we are as a strong number two in the lead when it comes to these new workloads. So, for example, we are seeing new logos. Customers who may have used a lot of the cloud for most of what they do are for the first time sort of starting to use Azure for some of their new AI workloads. We also have even customers who've used multiple clouds who use AWS for a class of sort of workloads also start new projects when it's in data and AI, which they were using other clouds for. So what I think you will see us is more share gains, more logo gains, reducing our CAC even.\nThose are the things, the points of leverage. But at the same time, we're not a small business anymore in any of these things. We're at significant scale. Yes, we celebrate. That's why we're even giving you the visibility of one point of it showing up this quarter, a couple of points showing up next quarter. And those are material numbers. That's kind of what I think we'll track. And I think Amy mentioned it because we want there are two parts to even this AI, right? There is the models themselves with our partnership with OpenAI. That's sort of one type of spend on compute. And the other is much more revenue-driven, right, which is we will track the inference cost to the revenue and demand. And you're already seeing both of those play out.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Al.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nOperator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. Satya, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your comments on data platforms. I think we've heard a lot over the last quarter or so about if you don't have a data strategy, it's tough to have an AI strategy. Can you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in terms of their ability to adopt AI services? Meaning, do they have to sort of tackle the data issue first before they can really take advantage of all the AI services? Or how should we think about that sort of juxtaposition? Thanks. Yeah. Sure.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman and CEO, Microsoft\n\nThank you for the question. Yes, absolutely. I think having your data, in particular in the cloud, is sort of key to how you can take advantage of essentially these new AI reasoning engines to complement, I'll call it, your databases. Because these AI engines are not databases, but they can reason over your data and to help you then get more insights, more completions, more predictions, more summaries, and what have you. So those are the things when we say Copilot design pattern, that's sort of what that design pattern is all about. The thing that perhaps even in the last quarter, and I had that in my remarks, it's most exciting is how with Microsoft Fabric, especially for the analytics workloads, we've brought together compute, storage, governance with a very disruptive business model.\nI mean, to give you a flavor for it, right, so you have your data in an Azure Data Lake. You can bring SQL Compute to it. You can bring Spark to it. You can bring Azure AI or Azure OpenAI to it, right? So the fact is you have storage separated from all these compute meters, and they're all interchangeable, right? So you don't have to buy each of these separately. That's the disruptive business model. So I feel that we are well-versed. Microsoft is very well positioned with the way our data architecture lays out, our business model around data, and how people will plan to use data with AI services. So that's kind of what I mean by getting your data estate in order.\nIt's not just getting the data estate in order, but you have to have it structured such that you can have the flexibility that allows you to exercise the data and compute in combinations that make sense for this new age.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nCVP and CFO, Microsoft\n\nThanks, Kirk. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you all. Thank you all. Thank you, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nCEO & Non-Independent Director, Microsoft Corp.\n\nThank you very much, Brett. The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack. We continue to focus on 3 priorities: first, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend; second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM; and third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.\nNow I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and is being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.\nOur Azure OpenAI service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter.\nJust last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate this next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API, and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models. More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest-ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry.\nIKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premise, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos. And at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefónica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.\nNow on to data. Our intelligent data platform brings together databases, analytics and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database, powering the world's most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service, one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever, enabling high reliability and low maintenance.\nThe NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And we are taking share with our analytics solutions, companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed to insight.\nNow on to developers. From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud, all while staying in their flow. Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship and maintain software. And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we are fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer from novices to experts. In 3 months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers.\nWe're also bringing next-generation AI to power platforms, so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents and analyze data using only natural language. More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform. And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we are extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks. All up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year.\nNow on to business applications. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate and predict every business process and function.\nAnd we are going further with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and note taking.\nNow on to our industry and cross-industry solutions. Our cloud for sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan and PCL as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments.\nOur Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week as we expanded our offerings for payers and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers. We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. And at Hannover Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows.\nNow on to future work. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work. Copilot works alongside users embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context. We've been encouraged by early feedback and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months.\nTeams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter, and we once again took share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN Amro, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys and Vodafone. We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to 2x faster performance while using 50% less memory so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot.\nTeams is also expanding our TAM. Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms or Premium. Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce cost with a 3-year ROI of over 140%. Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps now generally available. It's one of our fastest-growing modern-world products ever with thousands of paid customers just 2 months in.\nWith Microsoft Viva, we have created a completely new suite for employee experience. Viva brings together goals, communication, learning, workplace analytics and employee feedback across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive. Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement.\nAnd with Viva Sales, we've extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data so that they can automatically generate content like customer mail. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365, Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.\nNow on to Windows. While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices and higher usage compared to prepandemic. We're also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11.\nAnd with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how employees at companies like Mazda and nationwide access Windows. All up, over 1/3 of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to date. A new Windows 365 frontline extends the power and security of cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time.\nNow on to security. Our comprehensive AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders. Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider. And we once again took share across all major categories we serve, and we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers. With Security Copilot, we are combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity.\nAnd we also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year. And all up, nearly 600,000 customers now have 4 or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection visibility across their organizations.\nNow on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell and get hired. Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter as we expanded to new audiences.\nWe now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z entered the workforce, we saw 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign-ups. In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity.\nOur hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter. The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function for marketing, sales and finance to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss and up-level their skills with more than 100 AI courses.\nAnd we have introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions and collaborative articles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform.\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated premium video content to our ad network, and our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits.\nTwo months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we are very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns. All up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs on the Bing mobile app have grown 4x since launch. We are making progress in share gains.\nEdge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter, and Bing once again grew share in the United States. We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts powered by DALL-E. Over 200 million images have been created to date, and we see that when people use these new AI features, their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up.\nAs we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI's ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.\nNow on to gaming. We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice of people to play great games whenever, however and wherever they want. We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. Across our content and services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love.\nOur revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter. This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we are available. Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first-party titles and have never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall.\nIn closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI. In a few weeks' time, we'll hold our Build conference, where we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in. I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\nAmy Hood\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency. Our results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners.\nIn our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency. We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition. In Office 365 stand-alone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows commercial stand-alone products remain consistent with Q2.\nIn Azure, customers continue to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated, which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations.\nWe have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next-generation AI capabilities. Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewable sales motions mentioned earlier.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations.\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations, driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by lower Azure margin.\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change of accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue.\nOperating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago.\nOperating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office Commercial. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency.\nOffice 365 Commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offering.\nOffice Commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum at Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which went from 25% to 29% in constant currency, with healthy growth across all workloads.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency.\nIn our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running a multi-cloud environment, offset by transactional licensing.\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly.\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income was 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations.\nWe saw better-than-expected PC demand, as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S.\nAnd in gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content and growth in Xbox Game Pass.\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provisions and employee payments primarily related to head count growth and an increase in employee compensation.\nFree cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%. This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nNow moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for the next quarter and FY '24 does not include any impact from Activision as we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.\nNow to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing.\nOverall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue through Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions, including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth.\nLast year, we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitment to our platform as we focus on meeting customers' changing contract needs, which include shorter term, quick time-to-value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\nWe expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis, driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. A reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.\nNext, the segment guidance. For Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 12% in constant currency or USD 17.9 billion to USD 18.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365. We see growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency.\nIn our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or USD 23.6 billion to USD 23.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\nIn Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4, as noted earlier.\nOur per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises total business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.\nAnd in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 13.35 billion to USD 13.75 billion. PC demand should be similar to Q3, and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s.\nAnd Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\nSearch and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than the overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue is similar to Q3. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect Xbox content services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or USD 16.8 billion to USD 17 billion and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or USD 15.1 billion to USD 15.2 billion. Other income and expense is to be roughly $300 million and interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense.\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision.\nNow I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation. And we are excited about the early feedback and demand signals for the AI capabilities we have announced to date.\nWe will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend as we scale with the growing demand, driven by customer transformation. And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time. As always, we remain committed to aligning cost and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled CapEx investment will impact COGS growth, we expect FY '24 operating expense growth to remain low.\nAs a team, we are continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it.\nWith that, let's go to Q&A. Brett?\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted.\nWe will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we'll refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.\nToday's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Brett. I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear. Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born as we turn the world's most advanced AI models into a new computing platform.\nIn this environment, we remain convicted on 3 things. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty and share position while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This, in turn, sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly, we're going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts.\nWith that as a backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now I'll highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today's economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we're still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.\nAs an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal.\nNow on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements. And ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers.\nNow on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing nonlinear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It's being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT.\nJust last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available, and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. And yesterday, we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We are pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider, and we'll deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state-of-the-art in AI.\nAll of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100% for 5 quarters in a row with companies like AXA, FedEx and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage and govern their models.\nNow on to developers. Modernizing applications is mission-critical to any company's operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help. GitHub is now home to 100 million developers and GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than 1 million people have used Copilot to date. This quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses, and we have seen strong interest and early adoption from companies, including Duolingo, Lemonade and Volkswagen's CARIAD Software Group.\nNow on to Power Platform. Power Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today's environment.\nWe are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. We are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers from AT&T to Rabobank, up over 50% year-over-year. And we are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows.\nNow on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience and supply chain functions. For example, J&J, Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service. Fujifilm is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor Scott & White in Texas is using our digital contact center to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions.\nNow on to Industry Solutions. Our industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack. Our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF last week as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology.\nIn Financial Services, our new partnership with London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next generation of data analytics and workspace solutions. And in health care, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI, with Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions.\nNow on to systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work. Microsoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications as well as new applications like Designer, Stream and Loop. We have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12% year-over-year, and we introduced Microsoft 365 Basic, bringing our premium offerings to more people.\nTeams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic, and we continue to take share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling. Teams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Polly, ServiceNow and Workday have each surpassed 0.5 million active users, and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40% year-over-year. There are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70% year-over-year, and the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year.\nNovo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally in our largest deal to date. Teams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We have added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone. With Teams Premium, we are meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We have seen strong interest in preview and we will make it broadly available next month.\nWith Microsoft Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience and organizational productivity. U.S. Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications, and Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees. In today's environment, aligning the entire organization and the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work.\nViva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the super app in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We have seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter. All-up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. 80% of our enterprise customers use 5 or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, IKEA, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto as well as the State Government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.\nNow on to Windows. While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic with time spent per PC up nearly 10%. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition.\nWe're also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over 2/3 year-over-year. Leaders in every industry from Campari and Grant Thornton U.K. to Nutrien and Woolworths are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500.\nNow on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management and privacy informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack in order to reduce risk, complexity and cost.\nThe number of organizations with 4 or more workloads increased over 40% year-over-year. U.K. retailer Frasers Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Astellas Pharma, Ferrovial and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIEM capabilities.\nNow on to LinkedIn. People and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year.\nSkills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages, and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform.\nNow on to advertising. Despite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first- and third-party portfolios. Our browser, Microsoft Edge gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Bing continues to gain share in the United States, and daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30% year-over-year. We are now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory.\nWith PromoteIQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer, Endeavor, as well as Canada's Hudson's Bay. And Globo, the largest Brazilian TV broadcaster, chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market.\nNow on to gaming. In gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want. We saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours and monthly active devices, and monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter. We continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company's PC and mobile games, along with premium content available to subscribers.\nAnd finally, we are energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios, and we'll be sharing details and game play at our showcase tomorrow.\nIn closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. We will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency while also raising the bar on our operational excellence. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by reiterating Satya's thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week's announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion and earnings per share by $0.12.\nOur second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2% and 7% in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2% and 8% in constant currency; operating income decreased 3% and increased 6% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $2.32, which decreased 6% and increased 2% in constant currency.\nIn our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. In our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment and we saw results weaken through December.\nWe saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the stand-alone Office 365, EMS and Windows commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.\nFrom a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world. However, performance in the U.S. was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continue to see share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates, and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new stand-alone business noted earlier.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 29% and 26% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32%. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations.\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point better than expected, driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure.\nCompany gross margin percentage was 67%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points, driven by a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. Operating expense, when adjusted for the Q2 charge, increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition and LinkedIn.\nAt a total company level, headcount ended December 19% higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1%. Year-over-year growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points, primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact as well as a lower mix of OEM revenue.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7% and 13% in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 12% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier.\nOffice Consumer revenue declined 2% and increased 3% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 14% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier.\nDynamics revenue grew 13% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21% and 29% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings.\nOperating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. Operating income increased 6% and 17% in constant currency as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18% and 24% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% and 38% in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate, particularly in December, and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid-30s.\nIn our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 16% to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 2% in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 2% and 7% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs.\nOperating expenses increased 34% and 37% in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7% and 15% in constant currency, as roughly 7 points of favorable impact of the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19% and 16% in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial and Search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36% on a strong prior year comparable. Devices revenue decreased 39% and 34% in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3% and increased 3% in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business and stand-alone offerings noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, a bit lower than expected, as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit.\nAnd in gaming, revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12% and 8% in constant currency, given the strong first-party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29% and 24% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year, driven by lower device gross margin and sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses.\nOperating expenses increased 6% and 9% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47% and 40% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7% and free cash flow declined 16%.\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated, driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nNow moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes; 3 points in Intelligent Cloud; and 2 points in More Personal Computing. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And LinkedIn and Search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious.\nIn our Commercial business, we expect business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution, given our strong position in global growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Our data center investments continue to be based on a near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities.\nNext, segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD 16.9 billion to USD 17.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 1 point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and the slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure.\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365, which is now over 80% of total Dynamics revenue. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 19% in constant currency or USD 21.7 billion to USD 22 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\nIn Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid-30s in constant currency. And from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about 1 point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services.\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 11.9 billion to USD 12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid- to high 30s, in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. In devices, revenues should decline in the mid-40s as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier.\nSearch and news advertising ex TAC should grow high single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr.\nAnd in gaming. On a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour and third-party and first-party content.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 1% and 2% in constant currency or to be between USD 15.65 billion and USD 15.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 11% and 12% at constant currency or be USD 14.7 billion to USD 14.8 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains and losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision.\nNow some thoughts on H2 and the full year. First, in our Commercial business, revenue grew 20% on a constant currency basis in H1. However, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2, given how we exited December. Next, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million. Third, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency.\nFinally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning cost and growth, investing in our customer success and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs.\nIn the first half of the year, over 70% of our revenue came from our Commercial business and over 70% of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation and durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I'm confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near term by continuing to position ourselves for the future. With that, let's go to Q&A. Brett?\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brett Iversen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release; in the comments made during this conference call; and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Brett. To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times. First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend where digital technology as a percentage of world's GDP will continue to increase. Second, we'll prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend so that they can do more with less. And finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.\nWith that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24% and 31% in constant currency. And based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant currency this fiscal year as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business.\nWith that, let me highlight our progress starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We're also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services, including containerized applications across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud, companies like Chobani, Munich Re, Sodexo, Volvo Cars all run SAP on Azure.\nWe are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running in Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with Azure Confidential Computing, we're enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50% of its applications to Azure.\nNow to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut integration tax associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding workloads at limitless scale. Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and NoSQL workloads.\nAnd in AI, we are turning the world's most advanced models into platforms for customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of DALL-E to Azure OpenAI Service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time.\nAnd Azure Machine Learning provides industry-leading MLOps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage and govern models. All up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100% for 4 quarters in a row.\nNow on to developers. We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native applications. Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and GitHub's developer-first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud on any platform, up 3x.\nGitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into the developer's workflow. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications.\nNow on to Power Platform. We are helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics.\nPower Apps is the market leader in low-code, no-code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50% compared to a year ago. Power Automate has more than 7 million monthly active users and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Maersk, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we're going further with new AI-powered capabilities in Power Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.\nNow on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications.\nNow on to Industry Solutions. We are seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard-to-measure Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we are seeing record growth in health care driven in part by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solutions, which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it's quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader health care offerings.\nNow on to new systems of work, Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today's digitally connected distributed world of work. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker reducing cost and complexity for IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content as well as personalized recommendations.\nMicrosoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we have gained and are seeing increased engagement, too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use 4 or more features within Teams increased over 20% year-over-year.\nTeams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third-party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year-over-year, and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.\nTeams Phone provides the best-in-class calling. PSTN users have grown by double digits for 5 quarters in a row. We are bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco's devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively. And we are creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help organizations evolve and manage the space for hybrid and in-person work. Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where.\nWe also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry from Fannie Mae and Land O'Lakes to Rabobank continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.\nWe've also built a completely new suite for our employee experience platform, Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like [Finastra], SES and Unilever. And we are extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva sales is helping salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system.\nNow on to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth. All up, there are nearly 20% more monthly active Windows devices than prepandemic; and on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5% more time on their PCs than they were 2.5 years ago. And we are seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees' PCs, up from just 25,000 7 months ago; and L'Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.\nNow to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity and device management and privacy across all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry from BP and Fujifilm to ING Bank, iHeartMedia and Lumen Technologies now use our security solutions, up 33% year-over-year. They can save up to 60% when they consolidate our security stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have increased 50% year-over-year.\nMore organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year-over-year. And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps life cycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories.\nNow on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2x the pace as in the United States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4x year-over-year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning helped companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43% year-over-year.\nAnd with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next-generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.\nMore broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate. We've expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4x over the past year. We are seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start and Bing driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest-growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon price comparison features to save money. We surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date. And this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2x more content compared to a year ago. And we're also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales.\nAnd with PromoteIQ, we offer an omni-channel media platform for retailers like the Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships.\nNow on to gaming. We are adding new gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want on any device. We saw usage growth across all platforms driven by the strength of console. PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159% year-over-year; and with cloud gaming, we're transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed. More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to date, and we are adding support for new devices like handhelds from Logitech and Razer as well as Meta Quest. And as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S. Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.\nIn closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we're innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35 and increased 4% and 11% in constant currency when adjusted for the net tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal year '22.\nDriven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken through Q1. In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.\nAs you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings with growth of 31% in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3% and increased 16% in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution, and we continued to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the $10 million plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 34% in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which we recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38% year-over-year, and our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%.\nFX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger U.S. dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points and, at the segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 6 points and more personal computing revenue growth by 3 points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 3 points.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 73%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier and Nuance.\nOperating expense increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas just mentioned as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively.\nOperating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance and the lower Azure margin noted earlier.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution noted earlier.\nGrowth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw a continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office Consumer revenue grew 7% and 11% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions which grew 13% to $61.3 million.\nDynamics revenue grew 15% and 22% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24% and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13% and 16% in constant currency, and operating income increased 10% and 19% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20% and 26% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 28% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35% and 42% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads.\nIn our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 18% to over 232 million seats, with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat and increased 4% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by hybrid demand, including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 10% in constant currency, driven by Enterprise Support Services.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 8 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 17% and 25% in constant currency with roughly 9 points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2% and 8% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large HoloLens deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 16% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from an increase in search volumes and roughly 5 points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter.\nAnd in gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13% and 19% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3% and increased 1% in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 5 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition. And operating income decreased 15% and 9% in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.6 billion; and cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22.\nFree cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million, driven by interest income, which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nNow moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year.\nFirst, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 7 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud, and 3 points in More Personal Computing.\nOur outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and search and news advertising revenue.\nIn our commercial business, demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with consistent execution, should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base against a strong prior year comparable, which included a significant volume of large long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 2 points driven by lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy cost, revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.\nNext to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD 16.6 billion to USD 16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth from E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-30s.\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in mid- to high single-digit revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low double digits or the low 20s in constant currency driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 22% and 24% in constant currency or USD 21.25 billion to USD 21.55 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base.\nIn our on-premise server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 14.5 billion to USD 14.9 billion.\nIn Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s, reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. In devices, revenue should decline approximately 30%, again, roughly in line with the PC market.\nIn Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. Search and news advertising, ex TAC, should grow in the low to mid-teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr.\nAnd in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens against a strong prior year comparable. That included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency or to be between USD 17.4 billion and USD 17.6 billion, and operating expense to grow between 17% and 18% in constant currency or to be between USD 14.3 billion and USD 14.4 billion.\nAs we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022.\nNow some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly 5 point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20% constant currency growth in our commercial business, driven by strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market.\nWith the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater-than-expected energy cost, we now expect operating margins in U.S. dollars to be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact of the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY '23 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year.\nIn closing, in this environment, it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, Security, Teams, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn, where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally. And you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially through the year, while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we've made over the last year.\nWith that, let's go to Q&A. Brett?\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel.\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nUnless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Brett. Amid this macroeconomic environment, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $25 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 28% and 33% in constant currency. When I talk with customers, it's clear there is a real opportunity to help organizations in every industry use digital technology to overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger.\nIn this environment, we are focused on 3 things: first, no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative so that they can do more with less. From infrastructure and data to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses and categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage.\nWith that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of $100 million-plus and $1 billion-plus deals this quarter. We have more data center regions than any other provider, and we will launch 10 regions over the next year.\nOur new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security and privacy requirements. With Azure Arc, we are meeting customers where they are enabling companies like GM, Gregg, UBS and Uniper to run applications across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We are seeing more customers move their mission-critical workloads to Azure.\nAmerican Airlines, for example, chose our cloud to run its key operational workloads, including its data warehouse. And Telstra will move its internal IT workloads to Azure. And we are the platform of choice for SAP apps on the cloud. Leaders in every industry, including Kraft Heinz, Fujitsu and Unilever have migrated ERP workloads to Azure. Just last week, we announced a new service to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure. We are the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running in the Oracle Cloud.\nNow on to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric spanning operational databases, analytics and governance, helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating fragmented data estate. More than 65% of the Fortune 1000 use 3 or more of our data solutions, and we are growing faster than the market. We are seeing leaders in every industry from LaLiga and Lenovo to Swiss Re and Walgreens unify their data using our tools. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world's most demanding mission-critical workloads at any scale. Transactions in data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row.\nWhen it comes to AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as the world's large AI models become powerful platforms themselves. With our Azure OpenAI service, a diverse set of customers from HSBC, PwC and RTL Group to Shell and Wipro are applying language models to advanced scenarios like content and code generation.\nNow on to developer tools. We have the most popular developer tools across any cloud and any platform. Leaders in every industry from Ahold Delhaize to KPMG to Philips are all choosing GitHub to build software. GitHub Copilot is the first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, which helps developers write better code faster. More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available a month ago.\nAnd with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. All up, revenue from Azure container services increased by triple digits.\nNow on to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains at a time when it's never been more important. We now have nearly 25 million monthly active users, and we are innovating to make it even easier for teams of pro and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. AB InBev, ARM, Equinor, Toyota, Vodafone and Zurich Insurance have all built centers of excellence to train employees at scale on how to use Power Platform. PG&E, for example, expects to save at least 720,000 hours by eliminating redundant and manual processes across employee workflows.\nNow on to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance and supply chain functions as we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement.\nAnd new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions. We are winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Peet's Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations.\nWhen it comes to our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are seeing strong adoption as we take a platform-driven approach to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative. For example, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, inclusive of Nuance, is becoming the platform of choice for companies across the health care value chain, looking to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Whether it's a provider modernizing care delivery, a health plan transforming the member experience or a retailer expanding into health services, having a technology partner that is truly dedicated to empowering their success is a significant differentiator for us. Intermountain Healthcare, for example, chose the Cloud for Healthcare as well as Nuance's DAX Ambient Intelligence solution as the pillar of its new digital strategy.\nNow on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. In this economic environment, every organization is looking to support employee flexibility and improve productivity. Hybrid work is now just work, and it's imperative that organizations reconnect and reengage the workforce at home, in the office and everywhere in between. To do this, companies need a digital fabric that connects employees as well as customers and partners wherever and whenever they work while reducing cost and complexity.\nWe are all in on Teams. Over the past year, we've introduced more than 450 capabilities to empower frontline and knowledge workers to collaborate synchronously and asynchronously as well as remote and in-person. Teams is taking share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling and seeing higher usage intensity as companies turn to the platform to accelerate their digital transformation and orchestrate all their business process in the flow of work.\nISVs from Adobe to Workday have built deep integrations with Teams. And more than 100,000 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lumen Technologies and Progressive Insurance have deployed custom line of business applications in Teams. All up, the number of third-party and LOB apps with active usage increased by 40% year-over-year.\nTeams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across VoIP and PSTN. We now have over 12 million PSTN users, nearly double the number a year ago. And Teams Rooms bridges the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like AI-powered cameras. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 have chosen Teams Rooms to connect employees across the hybrid workplace.\nWe're also building a completely new suite with Microsoft Viva, as we create a new employee experience category. This is both a priority for our customers and an expansive and high-growth TAM for us. 25% of the Fortune 500 already use Viva as organizations increasingly recognize that employee experience and well-being are essential to their productivity. We have seen broad adoption across segments and industries from Commonwealth Bank, Fidelity Investments and Mastercard to AstraZeneca and Schlumberger. And this innovation is driving revenue growth across Microsoft 365. Asahi, Expedia Group and Qualcomm all chose our premium offerings to transform how employees work. E5 seats increased more than 60% year-over-year.\nNow on to Windows. With Windows, we are putting people at the center to help them securely work, connect and play. Despite a changing market for PCs during the quarter, we continue to see more PCs shipped than pre pandemic and are taking share. And we are seeing higher monthly usage of Windows 11 applications with increased time spent across creative work, collaboration, gaming, media and writing code as people rely on the PC for its unique productivity capabilities, rich interactive experiences and to stay connected.\nWe are transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktop monthly active usage increased nearly 60% year-over-year. One year in, we are seeing strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl to LEGO Group and Schroders as they use cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees and speed M&A integration while reducing IT costs.\nNow on to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity. We're taking share across all major categories we serve. All up, our security revenue increased 40%. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top 3 cloud platforms, and we are seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson VUE and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds.\nAnd we're going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts, the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations.\nNow on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among the more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission-critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills and marketeers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritize skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40% of the companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates.\nLinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed $6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39% year-over-year. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look towards the long term.\nWe are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketeers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance. It starts with our first-party Internet experiences. We are focused on increasing our share and engagement across Edge, Bing and our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. Daily content consumption across Start in categories like news, weather, finance and sports increased 80% since we launched the service 1 year ago.\nAnd Edge continues to gain share as consumers use it to save money with our built-in coupon and price comparison features. Our approach extends to our third-party ad network. We closed our acquisition of Xandr last month and now power one of the world's largest marketplaces for premium advertising. With Microsoft advertising, every media and consumer Internet company now has a trusted platform for their own ad innovation and monetization.\nJust 2 weeks ago, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner willing to build and innovate with them. And with PromoteIQ, we are providing a platform for retailers like Home Depot, Kohl's and Kroger to build their own digital commerce and marketing channels. This quarter, Sephora chose our solution to help build a new advertising revenue stream while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships.\nNow on to gaming. We offer the best value in the gaming industry. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service includes access to hundreds of games, and Xbox Series S is the most affordable next-generation console. We sold more consoles live to date than any previous generation of Xbox and have been the market leader in North America for 3 quarters in a row amongst next-gen consoles. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are bringing games to new endpoints. Players now can stream Xbox games on Samsung Smart TVs. And we partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem.\nIn closing, we are investing in sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment and to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models and intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I'd like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter.\nFirst, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 per share, beyond our expectations shared in April.\nNext, extended production shutdowns in China that continued through May and a deteriorating PC market in June contributed to a negative Windows OEM revenue impact of more than $300 million. And finally, reductions in advertising spend impacted LinkedIn Marketing Solutions and search and news advertising revenue by more than $100 million. In our consumer business, despite those macro challenges, we drove another quarter of share gains for Windows in the PC market and for Edge in browsers.\nIn our commercial business, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for long-term commitments to our platform. And as you heard from Satya, we saw share gains in areas such as Data and AI, Dynamics, Teams and Security. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 25% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Our record commitment quarter was driven by increases in the number of $100 million-plus Azure and $10 million-plus Microsoft 365 contracts as well as consistent strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 34% and 37% in constant currency to $189 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 28% year-over-year. The remaining portion which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 39% year-over-year, and our acuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $25 billion and grew 28% and 33% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\nNow back to total company level. As noted earlier, FX decreased total company revenue by 4 points, 2 points unfavorable to expectations. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud.\nOperating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn and Nuance. OpEx growth included roughly 2 points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance and the impact from the Xandr acquisition, which closed in June. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, LinkedIn, sales and customer deployment, and included roughly 6 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions.\nOperating income increased 8% and 14% in constant currency, and operating margins decreased year-over-year to 40%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, operating margins were relatively unchanged as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses were offset by the impact of the Nuance acquisition.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.6 billion and grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $159 million more than expected. When adjusting for the additional FX headwind, overall segment results were in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 9% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5.\nPaid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth was impacted by some moderation in new deal volume outside of E5, particularly in the small and medium business customer segment. Demand for security, compliance and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 12% of our Office 365 commercial installed base.\nOffice commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million.\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% and 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown of advertising spend noted earlier. And Talent Solutions was impacted by weaker online job posts late in the quarter.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 12% and 19% in constant currency.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.9 billion, increasing 20% and 25% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $309 million, more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% and 46% in constant currency, about 1 point lower than expected, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth across customer segments.\nIn our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 21% to over 230 million seats, with some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by a greater-than-expected number of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly 7 points of impact from Nuance. And operating income grew 11% and 18% in constant currency.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.4 billion, increasing 2% and 5% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $127 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were below our guidance range, driven by the PC and ad trends mentioned earlier. Windows OEM revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Despite the deteriorating PC market, we saw share gains again this quarter and volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 6% and 12% in constant currency, lower than expected due to some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. Surface revenue grew 10% and 15% in constant currency, driven by commercial sales.\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier, partially offset by the inclusion of 3 weeks of results from Xandr.\nAnd in gaming, revenue declined 7% and 5% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 11% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 6% and 4% in constant currency, driven by lower engagement hours and monetization in third-party and first-party content, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.\nSegment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 4% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by increased usage of Windows Commercial cloud services. Operating expenses increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and operating income decreased 5% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $8.7 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.9 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.6 billion, increasing 8%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year.\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million, primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative 3-point impact on EPS growth.\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year-over-year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year.\nNow moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '23. First, effective at the start of FY '23, we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from 4 to 6 years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases.\nInvestments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets.\nAs a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today's call. Additional details on the mechanics of the change are in our earnings materials.\nSecond, on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a roughly 4-point impact to full year revenue growth with headwinds in H1 greater than in H2. FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points.\nNow to our full year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis, as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in U.S. dollars. We continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Revenue growth will be driven by continued momentum in our commercial business and a focus on share gains across our portfolio.\nOperating expense growth will be significant early in FY '23 and will moderate materially over the course of the year as we slow the rate of hiring to focus on key growth areas, increase the productivity of prior year headcount investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. And even with this significant level of investment in our future, we expect operating margins based on constant currency to be approximately flat year-over-year in FY '23, excluding the benefit from the latest change in useful life. And in U.S. dollars, we expect FY '23 full year margins to be roughly flat as the useful life benefit is mostly offset by the FX headwind mentioned earlier. And finally, we expect our FY '23 effective tax rate to be roughly 19%.\nNow to the outlook for the first quarter, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 6 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing.\nOverall, our outlook has the trends we saw in June continue through Q1. Continued weakness in the PC market demand and advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, LinkedIn and Search and news advertising revenue. Our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another strong quarter of revenue and share growth, although we expect to continue to see growth moderation in our small- and medium-sized business segment.\nIn commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth on a flat expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q1 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from the Nuance acquisition, partially offset by continued margin improvement in Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential decrease on a dollar basis, with normal quarterly spend variability and the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.\nNext to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or USD 15.95 billion to USD 16.25 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level.\nIn our on-premises business, on a prior year comparable, which benefited from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\nFor LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform, although results will be impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend and hiring, resulting in low to mid-teens rev growth. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, driven by share growth in Dynamics 365.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 25% and 27% in constant currency or USD 20.3 billion to USD 20.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\nWe expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 3 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption, and our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, although we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits, driven by strong demand for our hybrid offerings offset by the prior year comparable, which included benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. At Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits, driven by enterprise support, partially offset by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 1% and 4% in constant currency or USD 13 billion to USD 13.4 billion.\nIn Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-teens, reflecting continued weakness in the PC market. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the high single digits.\nIn Surface, revenue should decline in the low single digits. Search and news advertising ex TAC should grow in the mid- to high teens, roughly 10 points faster than the overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, driven by declines in first-party content, partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between USD 14.9 billion and USD 15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between USD 13.3 billion and USD 13.4 billion. Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow, with 11,000 hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment and commercial sales.\nIn other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nFinally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making $3.2 billion of tax payments related to the TCJA transition tax and the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 of FY '22. In closing, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services and increased commitment to our platform as we remain focused on delivering compelling customer value in this dynamic environment, resulting in continued share gains. As we manage through this period, we will continue to invest in future growth while maintaining intense focus on operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A.

Welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\nOn the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel.\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nUnless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.\nToday's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Brett.\nIt was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $23 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world's economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience and do more with less.\nNow I'll highlight examples starting with Azure. We're building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build, run and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter, we helped more customers than ever, simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations. And it's still early days. We're winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry from BlackRock to Bridgestone to Lufthansa are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure.\nAnd we are the market leader for customers' SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months. Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, U.S. Bank and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year, and we are seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment and geography.\nNow to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases, analytics and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we are seeing strong adoption of Purview as we help organizations govern, protect and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Borse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform.\nIn AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure machine learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell. And our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers.\nNow to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups as well as the world's most established enterprises.\n90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact, Mercedes-Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship and maintain software.\nNow on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 72% year-over-year, making it one of the fastest-growing businesses at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low-code, no-code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers. And our acquisition of Minit adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency.\nNow to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints, we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IoT, digital twins, connected spaces and mixed reality applications.\nAnd we are further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process.\nWhen it comes to industry, our 6 industry clouds are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical imaging and med tech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I'm excited about our opportunity to apply the company's deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance's business and our industry clouds.\nNow on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement as more than 830 million professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow and get hired. Amid the great reshuffle, we are seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%. Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.\nOur Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities using tools like Newsletter to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least 1 newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51% over the past quarter alone.\nNow on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last 2 years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization from the boardroom to the front line to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and the most advanced platform for work and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business.\nOur comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60% compared to a patchwork of single-point identity, productivity, collaboration and meeting solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We are seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials.\nTeams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third-party apps available in the Teams App Store. And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into flow of work.\nAnd we are adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone and Microsoft Viva. Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Bloom, Cerner, Marks & Spencer.\nThis quarter, we added LinkedIn's Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland government and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.\nNow on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work, life and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last 8 quarters and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release.\nWith Windows 365, we are bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands' End, SES and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop.\nIn consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks from browsing and searching to learning and gaming and shopping, all with security and privacy built in. We are seeing strong engagement with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content consumption and commerce as we generate new opportunities for content creators as well as advertisers. And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely.\nNow to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management and privacy across clouds and platforms informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyberattacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government as well as other public sector agencies.\nMulti-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we're the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry's top 3 cloud platforms. In identity, we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we are expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business, which will help keep small businesses secure.\nThis innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All of the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino's Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, PETRONAS, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry.\nNow on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when and how and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for 2 quarters in a row, and we are the market leader this quarter among the next-gen consoles in the United States, Canada, U.K. and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played and viewed. To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator, are now accessible on phones, tablets, low-spec PCs for the first time.\nOur Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45%. And with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build, host and grow their games. New capabilities, speed, time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue, fiscal year-to-date, increased 66%.\nIn closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models built on a common tech stack position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone.\nThis quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year '21.\nSeveral items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call. First, Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY '22 and accretive in FY '23 to non-GAAP EPS.\nSecond, FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively.\nFinally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue, and we expect that it will decline significantly. The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.\nOur results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth.\nIn our Commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners, drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier.\nCommercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better-than-expected growth in large long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points.\nOur on-premises transactional licensing revenue across both the Office and Server businesses was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our open licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% constant currency to $155 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that we'll recognize within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%.\nCommercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by improvement across the cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our Consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles and our Edge browser.\nNow back to the company level. As noted earlier, U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations; decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations; and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point, driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.\nOperating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance. Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency, and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Better-than-expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn and Office Consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the open licensing transition, Russia as well as lower-than-expected results in Dynamics. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue.\nPaid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly $345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 Commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365. Office Commercial licensing was lower than expected, about 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office Consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million.\nDynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365. This grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market, although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately 4 weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate.\nIn our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings, partially offset by the open licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on-premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate.\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in enterprise support services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure, partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency, and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in Search and Windows, offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license. Windows commercial, products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365, with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\nSurface revenue grew 13% and 18% constant currency, lower than expected, driven by consumer channel, partially offset by strength in Commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine.\nAnd in gaming. On a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency, and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20 billion, up 17%.\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated, driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nNow before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.\nSecond, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis.\nWith that context in place, let's turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across the solution portfolio and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In Commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable.\nAs a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.\nNext is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by 1 point or 2 on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\nFor LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high 20s, driven by strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\nWe expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis, with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base.\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable, which included 4 points of benefits, a benefit from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits.\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China, which had negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market, where revenue per license is higher.\nIn Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the low double digits. In Search and news advertising ex TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high single digits, driven by lower engagement hours year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits, though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion, excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million, reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April.\nSimilar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\nWe expect to close FY '22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year, with strong revenue growth, share gains and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look towards FY '23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth.\nNow Brett, let's go to Q&A.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?",

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\nSatya Nadella\n\nChairman & CEO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $22 billion in revenue, up 32% year-over-year. We are living through a generational shift in our economy and society. Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world's disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life. We are innovating and expanding our entire portfolio across consumer and commercial segments to help people and organizations thrive in this new era.\nNow I'll highlight examples, starting with Azure. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need a distributed computing fabric to build, manage, secure and deploy applications anywhere. We have more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services while meeting data resiliency requirements. We're extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user.\nAT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next-generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year-over-year. We are now helping thousands of organizations from BP to Robobank unify their on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure.\nAnd as the digital and physical worlds come together, we are seeing real enterprise metaverse usage. From smart factories to smart buildings to smart cities, we are helping organizations use the combination of Azure IoT, Digital Twins and Mesh to help digitize people, places and things in order to visualize, simulate and analyze any business process. Ecolab, for example, is using these tools to build its own platform to model and optimize water management. Across Azure, we are seeing growing adoption across every sector. CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, and Wells Fargo all chose our cloud as their preferred provider this quarter.\nNow on to data. From best-in-class databases and analytics to AI and data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development at any scale. Data volumes and transactions increased over 100% year-over-year. With Azure Synapse, we are removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics, so anyone can collaborate, build and manage analytics solutions. Data governance is emerging as an important and growing category. And Azure Purview is leading here, helping thousands of organizations achieve a more complete understanding of their data estate.\nIn AI, we have one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cloud, and we're using it not only to train new models but to deliver them as platforms to our customers. Our new Azure OpenAI Service is in preview and that brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. GitHub Copilot is using this capability to help developers write better code. More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our cognitive services, with over [30 million] hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly 2x compared to a year ago.\nNow to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer going from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers' workflow, we are investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every DevSecOps workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we are seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch. And organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our PaaS services like Container Apps and Chaos Studio to streamline development and build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications.\nNow to Power Platform. Low code, no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization's digital capability building. We're innovating to help organizations like Airbus, Centrica and Johnson Controls rapidly scale their use of Power Platform using end-to-end suite to automate workflows, create applications, build virtual agents and analyze data. At H&M, more than 30,000 employees have used Power Platform to drive productivity gains. We have created more than 1,500 applications, flows and dashboards to date for everything from managing office capacity to tracking team goals. And at Kroger, more than 420,000 associates are using our return to workplace solution, which is built on Power Platform to verify their health and vaccination status.\nNow on to Dynamics 365. To counter demand shocks and supply constraints in this economy, every business will need to become a hyperconnected business, unifying data, process and teams across the organization. Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. For Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries from real estate to retail to factories and construction.\nCompanies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new customer experience platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touch points to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to preempt supply chain issues. And just yesterday, we announced a new logistics-as-a-service offering with FedEx, combining data and insights from the company's network with Dynamics 365 to help brands better fulfill shape and service customer orders.\nNow on to industry solutions. Just over a year ago, we introduced our first industry cloud offering, bringing together our industry-specific customizations with our entire stack to help customers improve time to value, increase agility and lower costs. We now have 6 industry clouds and they are driving significant increases in usage across the Microsoft Cloud. Our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF, and retailers from Ahold Delhaize and GNC are sharing how they're using our solutions to deliver seamless customer experiences.\nOur cloud for sustainability unifies data to help customers record, report and reduce their carbon emissions. Industry leaders, including Nissan Motor, are turning to the offering to help meet sustainability goals.\nNow on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a great reshuffle across the labor market as more people in more places than ever rethink how, where and why they work. In this new economy, LinkedIn has become mission-critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with employers, learners with skills and sellers with buyers. Last quarter, we once again saw record engagement, and LinkedIn has become one of the world's largest platform for professional events with more than 24,000 events created and 1.5 million RSVPs each week.\nConfirmed hires were up 110% year-over-year, and we've added tools to make it easier to discover open roles that align with how and where people want to work. With entrepreneurship on the rise, our new Service Marketplace has helped nearly 3 million freelancers and small businesses discover new clients. We also saw strong growth in LinkedIn Sales Solutions, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months for the first time. Our sales, talent, marketing and premier subscriptions lines of business have all now reached this milestone.\nNow on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Every organization today needs a digital fabric to connect and empower everyone inside and outside the organization, from knowledge and frontline workers to customers and partners. At the center of this digital fabric is Teams, which surpassed 270 million monthly active users this quarter. Organizations are using Teams to run their business with collaborative applications that bring business process data right into the flow of work. Monthly usage of third-party applications and custom-built solutions has grown 10x in the last 2 years, with new and updated apps this quarter from Atlassian, Monday.com, SAP and Workday.\nUnited Airlines is using bots within Teams to create tighter connections between operations and flight crews. And Marks & Spencer uses Power Apps and Teams to streamline internal help desk requests. As hybrid work becomes the norm, every organization will need to rethink their approach to space. With Teams Rooms, we are bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help people stay connected and participate fully in meetings from anywhere. The number of active Teams Room devices more than doubled year-over-year.\nAnd with Mesh for Teams, we're bringing the for Teams, helping employees at organizations like Accenture access a shared immersive experience where they can have water cooler type conversations and even white boarding sessions. Teams is rapidly becoming the standard for unified communications. Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies use Teams from this quarter, and we continue to take share across PSTN and VoIP as organizations like Bank of Montreal, Chevron, General Motors, LVMH and NetApp turn to Teams to meet their internal and external collaboration needs.\nAll up, we are seeing Teams growth in every segment from frontline worker usage up 2x year-over-year. Zebra Technologies will bring Teams walkie-talkie communications to devices used by millions of employees on retail floors. And Walmart chose Teams for their more than 2 million frontline workers this quarter. And we are expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first stand-alone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It's early days but we are very encouraged by the strong demand.\nWith Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning resources and insights to help people feel connected to the company's mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers, including Bloom, Nationwide and REI to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. From Heineken to Hilton to Zurich Insurance, organizations continue to choose our premium E5 offering for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.\nNow on to Windows. We've seen a structural shift in PC demand. More than ever, people are turning to PCs to exercise their agency and unleash their creativity, whether it's meeting in virtual reality or for remote work, writing code or collaborating in documents, live streaming video or playing games or for graphic design and engineering design. As new use cases are born every day and existing ones see a resurgence, we are experiencing a PC renaissance with increased in time spent on PCs and PCs per household.\nThree months in, we are delighted by the response to Windows 11. We are seeing more usage intensity and higher quality than previous versions of our operating system. And Windows took share this quarter. We are delivering Windows in new ways to meet evolving customer needs. This quarter, we introduced Windows 11 SE, our cloud-first operating system purpose-built for schools. And with Windows 365, we are bringing the operating system to the cloud, helping businesses like Coats North America and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stream the full Windows experience to any employee device.\nThere are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they are a powerful on-ramp for both our first-party and third-party services. Windows 11 users engage with the Windows App Store at nearly 3x the rate of Windows 10. And across Bing and Edge, we are creating differentiated high-value experiences for consumers and advertisers in key verticals, including shopping. Just 1 year since the launch of coupon and price comparison features in Edge, we already have surfaced more than $800 million in savings.\nMore broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr's large-scale data-driven platforms.\nNow on to security. Cybercrime is the #1 threat facing every business today. Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive zero-trust architecture that protects people, devices, applications and data holistically across the heterogeneous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in 2 interconnected ways: first, we incorporate security by design into every product we build; and second, we deliver advanced end-to-end cross-cloud cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity device management and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day.\nAmong analysts, we are a leader in more than -- more security categories now, 19 than any other provider. Our multi-cloud multi-platform innovation is driving growth. Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on Microsoft account to securely access their favorite products and services with just 1 log-in. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIM, Microsoft Sentinel to stop threats before they happen, up over 70% year-over-year.\nAnd all up, the number of customers that use our Advanced Security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have 4 or more workloads up 75% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. On average, customers save 60% compared to multi-vendor solutions. As a result of our customers' trust, our security business revenue surpassed $15 billion over the past 12 months, up nearly 45% year-over-year.\nNow on to gaming. The big bets we have made across content, community and cloud over the past few years are paying off. We saw record engagement as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. Our differentiated content is driving the services growth, and we released new AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. 18 million have played Forza Horizon 5 to date and more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history.\nAnd with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard announced last week, we're investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want and also shape what comes next for gaming as platforms like the metaverse develop.\nIn closing, as digital technology as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across a diverse and growing TAMs with common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture and sense of purpose. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.\n\nAmy E. Hood\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.7 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Earnings per share was $2.48, increasing 22%. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter, and as a result, FX had no impact on total company and segment revenue growth, which was a 1-point headwind compared to expectations. Despite this, we delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in each of our business segments, reflecting our unique and differentiated market position across a connected portfolio of diverse businesses.\nIn our commercial business, strong execution by our sales teams and partners, combined with continued demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, drove significant growth in large long-term Azure contracts as well as increased usage of Teams and our Advanced Security and Identity offerings. And LinkedIn Talent Solutions benefited from a strong job market again this quarter.\nIn our consumer business, increased PC demand and usage, as Satya highlighted, benefited our Windows OEM business. Continued advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn marketing solutions as well as search and news advertising. And a strong holiday quarter for gaming, we saw record revenue and engagement on the platform, with significant growth in Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles as well as continued demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles.\nNow to our overall results. Commercial bookings grew 32% and 37% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the large long-term Azure contracts noted earlier and strong execution across our core annuity sales missions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $147 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 26% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 37% year-over-year, highlighting the long-term commitment customers are making to the Microsoft Cloud.\nAnd our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 94%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% to $22.1 billion, again ahead of our expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\nAs noted earlier, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the quarter, FX had no company or segment revenue growth impact and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth. Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.\nOperating expense increased 14%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investment that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, headcount grew 16% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas, such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, gaming and LinkedIn. Operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 1 point year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 3 points year-over-year.\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.9 billion and grew 19% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue exceeded expectations, driven by LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 14%. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19% was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.\nDemand for our Advanced Security, compliance and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats increased 16% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office Commercial licensing decreased 17% in line with expectations and consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud.\nOffice consumer revenue grew 15%, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 19% to 56.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 29% year-over-year, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 45% and 44% in constant currency. Continued demand for our modern low-code app development solutions drove another strong quarter with 161% revenue growth in Power Apps.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 37% and 36% in constant currency with continued strength in parking solutions, which grew 43% year-over-year as well as better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the strong job market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and operating income increased 24%.\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $18.3 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue grew ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services growth of 46% was driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services.\nIn our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 28% to over 209 million seats. And our on-premises business revenue increased 6%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in enterprise support services and Microsoft consulting services.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 22% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly with improvements in Azure, partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 14% and operating income grew 26%.\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $17.5 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM, Surface and Search and news advertising. Revenue growth included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Windows OEM revenue increased 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the strong PC market noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license.\nAs a reminder, these results include roughly 6 points of positive impact from the $210 million revenue deferral related to Windows 11, which shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 14% in constant currency, driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue grew 8% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as we were able to ship more devices than anticipated into a strong demand environment.\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 32%, better than expected, benefiting from strong advertising market noted earlier. And we saw share gains in our Edge browser on Windows 10 and 11 devices. And in gaming, revenue increased 8%, in line with expectations. Expo's hardware revenue grew 4% and 3% in constant currency, driven by continued strong demand and better-than-expected console supply on strong prior year comparable that included the launch of the Xbox Series X and S.\nXbox content and service revenue increased 10%, lower than expected as strong growth in first-party titles and Game Pass subscriptions was partially offset by weaker third-party title performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% year-over-year. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses and improvement in search and news advertising.\nOperating expenses increased 17%, driven by investments in gaming, particularly ZeniMax, search and news advertising and Windows marketing. Operating income grew 22% and 21% in constant currency.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year, lower than expected, primarily due to quarterly spend volatility and the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.9 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals.\nCash flow from operations was $14.5 billion, increasing 16% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds. Free cash flow was $8.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. This quarter, other income expense was $268 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nNow before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to provide a couple of reminders. First, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, although we do expect it to close during Q3. Second, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. With that, let's move to the third quarter outlook.\nFirst, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.\nNext, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, growth should be healthy. But we will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable as well as low growth in the expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term measure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q3 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points, driven by continued improvement across all cloud services despite revenue mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly down sequentially, with normal quarterly variability in the timing of the cloud infrastructure build-out.\nNext to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.6 billion and $15.85 billion. In Office 365, healthy revenue growth will be driven by the same factors as Q2, with similar seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens, with continued customer shift to the cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth in the low 30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.75 billion and $19 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be up sequentially in constant currency, driven by our Azure consumption business with strong growth on a significant base. And our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum though we expect some moderation in growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, continued demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits.\nIn Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the Commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single digits.\nIn Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices. In search and news advertising ex TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high teens against a strong prior year comparable that was driven by a recovery in the advertising market.\nAnd in gaming, on a prior year comparable that included significant strength in hardware from our consoles as well as across the Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox Content & Services, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits with strong engagement and continued momentum across the platform.\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion and operating expense of $13.4 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by headcount investments and high-growth strategic areas to drive continued long-term revenue growth. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio.\nAnd we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year expected tax rate of approximately 17%. And finally, for FY '22, given our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our current H2 outlook, full year operating margins should be slightly up year-over-year, even with the impact of changes in accounting estimates noted earlier and the significant strategic investments we are making to capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us.\nIn closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. And we are well positioned with innovative, high-value products. Our diverse yet connected portfolio of solutions spans end markets, customer sizes and business models, uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let's go to Q&A.\n\nBrett Iversen\n\nGeneral Manager of IR, Microsoft Corporation\n\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A.

Thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Today, we will cover our Q4 performance and 2025 full year results. We will also highlight the opportunities ahead of us, expectations for fiscal year 2026, and how we are continuing to advance our company strategy. I want to begin by saying how proud I am of the progress we have made across our priorities, especially as we have navigated a challenging external landscape. We have driven sequential profit improvement the last two quarters, demonstrating our ability to quickly respond to the challenging trade environment we began to face in Q2. We also invested in our supply chain, making it more resilient to mitigate future risks, which is core to the future-ready plan we laid out three years ago.\nOur performance, both for the quarter and the full year, underscores the strength of our strategy, the power of our portfolio, and the tenacity of our team. Let's start with our Q4 results. I am pleased to report that HP delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, up 4% year-over-year, largely driven by Personal Systems gains in commercial and consumer. In Print, the market remained soft, but we delivered revenue in line with our expectations. Collectively, key growth areas grew double-digit year-over-year, and delivered gross margin above our core business. Non-GAAP EPS came above the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to execute our future-of-work strategy. We are accelerating innovation with AI-powered devices that harness AI at the edge, and create better-together experiences across our portfolio.\nWe are also empowering CIOs with the tools they need to drive transformation, and we are leveraging the power of customer data to deliver meaningful insights. These priorities guide our innovation. For example, we introduced a new edge-class device, the AI Station, powered by NVIDIA, which can run up to 200 billion parameter models. It brings highly performant AI compute to the data instead of moving this data to the cloud for processing. We also launched innovations that boost productivity, for example, the industry's first 49-inch ultra-wide monitor that integrates AI noise reduction. Focusing on solutions, we are making printing smarter and more intuitive with new AI-driven printing and scanning features. These enhancements make printing easier by cleaning web and email layouts, reducing unnecessary pages. They also streamline everyday tasks, improving scan quality and auto-generating file names.\nOur Workforce Experience Platform now uses telemetry from 48 million endpoints to manage 2.4 million connected devices and already remediates more than 12 million IT issues every month. With its new integration with Microsoft Security Copilot, we are bringing generative AI directly into IT management for faster, smarter responses to critical issues. Inside HP, we are adopting our AI-powered innovations first, leading as a customer zero. For example, by deploying AI PCs with curated applications, we are equipping teams to deliver better results with their productivity up 16%. Now, I will take a closer look at the performance of each business unit. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 8% year-over-year, above our expectations. We drove worldwide PC market share gains, particularly in high-value categories, including commercial and consumer premium, and workstations.\nWith 40% of the installed base still on Windows 10 at the end of Q4, the Windows 11 refresh will remain a tailwind for the PC market into 2026. Demand for AI PCs continues to accelerate, now representing more than 30% of our shipments this quarter. In our key growth areas for Personal Systems, strong performance in data science workstations contributed to double-digit revenue growth in advanced compute solutions. In print, revenue declined 4%, reflecting market softness and delayed purchasing decisions across all regions. Print units declined year-over-year, but improved sequentially. We maintained our number one share in print. Supply revenue performed as expected, and we gained share. Looking closer at print key growth areas, consumer subscriptions delivered double-digit revenue growth and is just under $1 billion in annual revenue. We continue to see strong adoption of our all-in plan offering, with subscribers up double-digit sequentially.\nMomentum continued in industrial graphics, which exceeded $1.8 billion in annual revenue, driven by the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We also saw double-digit growth in 3D, driven by applications in drone and robotics manufacturing. In workforce solutions, double-digit growth was accompanied by key wins in industries such as energy, technology, and services. We added 10 new customers from the world's 200 largest companies, a testament to the strength of our sales team. Turning to our full year performance, revenue grew by 3%, returning to growth. Our key growth areas collectively grew double-digit year-over-year and represented over 1/3 of our revenue for the year. Personal Systems revenue grew 6%, driven by commercial strength. Print revenue declined 4% as market weakness persisted, and we prioritized placement of profitable units. Supply revenue declined 2% in constant currency, and we gained share.\nOperating profits declined as trade-related costs during the year took a few quarters to be absorbed. Aligned to our commitments, we executed with discipline in a challenging environment, driving a double-digit operating profit increase from the first half to the second. This reflects our ability to act decisively and accelerate supply chain transformation. HP continues to evolve, highlighted by recent leadership transitions that underscore our focus on combining the best internal and external talent to drive our long-term strategy. I am excited to welcome Ketan Patel as Head of Personal Systems, Manoj Leelanivas as Head of HP Solutions, and Prakash Arunkundrum as Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer to our leadership team. Each brings the right capabilities, experiences, and a proven track record of driving innovation and delivering results. I also want to thank Alex Cho and Dave Shull for their many contributions to HP.\nTheir leadership has been instrumental in strengthening our business. Now, let me address the trend of rising memory costs and its implications for our business. Memory costs are currently 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC. While an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks. Our portfolio is less sensitive to the commodities market than it was during the last memory cycle. Over 1/3 of the PS gross profit comes from services and peripherals. We expect to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds in the first half of our fiscal year with our inventory on hand, and a set of actions across our portfolio and basket of commodities. For the second half of the year, we expect personal system margins to be impacted.\nTherefore, we are taking a prudent approach to our guide while implementing aggressive actions to mitigate this. They include qualifying lower-cost suppliers, redesigning the portfolio for reduced memory configurations, accelerating our AI-enabled transformation to drive further cost savings, and raising prices in close partnerships with our channel and direct customers. From a supply perspective, we are in a good position due to our strong relationships and long-term contracts with key suppliers. Moving to fiscal year 2026, our plan is built on four pillars. First, in Personal Systems, we expect the revenue market to be up low single digit with Windows 11 refresh, AI PCs, and pricing as catalysts. We also expect to see a positive impact from the growth of premium devices, including workstations, and an increase of attached rate from services and peripherals. Our goal is to perform better than market.\nSecond, in Print, we expect to grow slightly faster than industry projections of low single-digit market decline. We intend to take share by doubling down on big tanks. We are increasing our marketing investments, driving new product and solution introductions, and expanding globally our successful all-in subscription offering. We also intend to grow share in office with new products and solutions designed for SMB and enterprise customers, reinforcing HP's leadership in manageability, security, and AI. We intend to strengthen our leadership in 3D printing and further build on the momentum from labels and packaging to maintain our lead in industrial printing. Third, in workforce solutions, we are focused on growing recovering revenue by expanding our software, security, and services businesses. We are also scaling our Workforce Experience Platform in key verticals, building on the strong momentum generated in fiscal 2025.\nFourth, driving an improved cost structure remains a top priority. We have demonstrated our ability to execute major transformations as part of our future-ready program, over-delivering on our initial expectations. As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity. We have launched a company-wide program led by an executive reporting directly to me. We have a line of sight to drive approximately $1 billion of gross fundraise savings over three years across product development, customer service, support, and many of our operational processes. This will result in workforce reductions of 4,000 to 6,000 people over the next years. These are some of the most difficult decisions we need to make, and we are committed to treating our colleagues with care and respect.\nWe are planning to hold our Investor Day on 23 April 2024, where we will share the full plan on how AI is transforming HP. We remain confident in our ability to lead the future of work through technology. With a clear strategy and disciplined execution, we are focused on driving long-term value while managing short-term headwinds. I will now turn it over to Karen.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nThank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our results in Q4, delivering another quarter of solid performance to close out the fiscal year. Our teams executed well, driving better-than-expected top-line growth, fueled by continued momentum in Personal Systems and in our key growth areas. We delivered operating margins within our expected ranges for both businesses, and non-GAAP EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range, underscoring our ability to meet or exceed our financial commitments.\nWe are also proud of the results we delivered with our multi-year future-ready cost plan. We surpassed our original $1.4 billion savings target, ultimately delivering $2.2 billion in cumulative gross annualized savings. On $1.2 billion of restructuring spend, we delivered a savings-to-charge ratio of almost 1.8x, well above our initially projected ratio of 1.4x. On the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, both nominally and in constant currency. In constant currency, EMEA grew 6%, and APJ was up 9% on strong Personal Systems performance. Americas revenue was flat in constant currency, reflecting demand softness in North America, particularly in commercial. Our gross margin at 20.2% was impacted by a higher mix from Personal Systems and increased trade-related costs, which we partly offset with pricing actions and cost reduction.\nContributions from our future-ready cost program and continued strong expense management drove operating expenses down as a percent of revenue year-over-year. These efforts also enabled our investment in key strategic and go-to-market initiatives aligned with our future-of-work strategy. All in, our non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, down year-over-year, but improving almost one point sequentially, in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.93, representing a sequential increase of 24%. Now, let's turn to segment performance. We delivered better-than-expected top-line growth in Personal Systems, with revenue up 8% on increased ASPs and 7% unit growth. We outperformed the market in both consumer and commercial, and continued to shift mix toward premium categories while maintaining disciplined pricing to help mitigate cost increases. Key growth areas performed well, including in AI PCs, where we doubled revenue year-over-year.\nIn commercial, we drove revenue and units up 7% on continued momentum from Win11 refresh and AI PC adoption. We also delivered strong performance in consumer, growing revenue 10% on 8% unit growth. We drove higher ASPs and share gains in consumer premium, in line with our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix. With holiday seasonality in consumer, we delivered revenue and unit growth of 17% sequentially. As we had signaled, the actions we started earlier in the year to leverage supply chain flexibility, reduce costs, and maintain pricing discipline gained traction in the second half. As a result, we drove sequential improvement in our PS operating margins, reaching 5.8% in Q4, in line with our guidance. In print, our results reflect a pricing environment that remains competitive despite higher industry costs and continued market softness globally as customers delay printer hardware refresh decisions.\nAgainst this backdrop, we continue to focus on profitable long-term unit placement, increasing lifetime value per customer, and cost reduction actions. We also drove solid growth in key growth areas in the quarter. Looking at the details, print revenue declined 4% on lower supplies volume and market-driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial. Consumer revenue was down 9% year-over-year, and commercial revenue down 4% as higher ASPs were offset by lower volumes. Supplies performed as expected, down 3% year-over-year in constant currency. We continue to drive market share gains with favorable pricing that partially offset installed base and usage headwinds. For the year, supplies revenue declined 2% in constant currency, in line with our long-term range. We delivered operating margin of 18.9%, in line with our guidance and at the top end of our range. Now, let me move to cash flow and capital allocation.\nWe generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations and roughly $1.5 billion in free cash flow on the strength of the sequential growth in Personal Systems. Free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2.9 billion, consistent with our outlook. We improved our cash conversion cycle quarter over quarter, driving days payable up through higher manufacturing activity. On capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders as long as our gross leverage remains below 2x and there aren't better return opportunities. In Q4, we returned close to $800 million to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase, and returned more than $1.9 billion for the fiscal year.\nWhile we finished the quarter slightly above our target leverage ratio, we increased our cash balances, reserving sufficient funds to pay down 2026 debt maturities, which enabled us to buy back shares in the quarter. If needed, as we move through the year, we can operate with higher cash balances in fiscal 2026 to further reduce leverage with maturities in fiscal 2027. Our Q4 and FY 2025 results reflect strong execution against challenging trade dynamics, with continued sequential improvement as promised in the back half of the year. Looking ahead, our guidance reflects the increasing inflationary pressures predicted for memory costs, which we expect at this point to have an impact as we move into the back half of our fiscal year. That said, we have a proven track record of managing challenges, and this one will be no different.\nWe are prudently including these pressures in our outlook, yet we remain confident in the strength of our organization and partnerships we've built with our suppliers to deliver the best possible outcome for our shareholders. We are also continuing to invest in driving transformation within the company, and we see a significant opportunity ahead to embed AI into almost all that we do to improve productivity, accelerate innovation, and improve customer experiences. As Enrique said, we have already made excellent progress in identifying key focus areas that are expected to generate approximately $1 billion in gross run rate savings by the end of our fiscal year 2028. We expect approximately $300 million of those savings to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2026. We estimate associated restructuring charges of around $650 million over the three-year period, which include roughly $250 million in charges to be incurred in FY 2026.\nWe continue to identify additional opportunities as part of this initiative and will share those with you at our upcoming investor day. Now, turning to our segment outlook for FY 2026. In Personal Systems, we are aligned with industry experts projecting the PC unit TAM to decline in units, but the revenue TAM to grow low single digit. Against that backdrop, we expect to gain share in premium categories, including AI PCs, workstations, and new device categories, and increase our attach of higher margin offerings, all leading to revenue share gains. We anticipate revenue to be stronger in the second half of the year, driven by normal seasonality and pricing as needed against rising costs. On operating margin, we expect the PS OP rate to stay in the 5% to 6% range in the first half of the year.\nAs Enrique said, we are already taking decisive steps to manage commodity inflation. However, with higher memory cost increases impacting our back half, we estimate our OP rate for the full year could be at the low end of our long-term 5% to 7% range. In Print, we anticipate a low single-digit decrease in the hardware market in 2026, with growth in big tank and industrial markets offset by declines in traditional hardware. We expect to outperform the market as we execute our plans to gain share in big tank and higher value office categories through new products and solutions, and to expand our subscription business and deliver continued growth in industrial. We also anticipate Supplies revenue to be down low single digits in constant currency within our long-term guidance range, with favorable pricing and continued share gains.\nWe expect print revenue by quarter to be generally in line with historical seasonality. We expect print operating margins for the year to be in the upper half of our 16% to 19% range, while we continue to focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined cost management. Beyond the segments, we expect corporate other and OI&E to be roughly flat year-over-year. As is typical, we expect corporate other expense to be more heavily weighted in Q1 due to the timing of our stock compensation expense. With all of this, and including an estimated $0.30 impact from projected memory cost increases net of mitigations, we expect FY 2026 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.20, and FY 2026 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.77.\nFor Q1, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.7 to $0.81, and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.66. On FY 2026 free cash flow, we expect to deliver between $2.8 billion to 3 billion. As typical, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first, consistent with our earnings, and recognizing that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of our incentive comp payment. Before closing, over the past year since joining HP, I have had the opportunity to not only learn and understand our businesses more deeply, but also reflect on key drivers of growth and value ahead. Across both print and Personal Systems, we have a relatively small but growing base of services, subscriptions, software, and products as a service that are contractual in nature.\nAs we look to the future, we intend to drive greater growth in this important base of higher margin, more stable recurring revenue. Expect us to highlight this even more for you as we continue to focus on strengthening our company and increasing the value we offer to our investors. Lastly, we are pleased to announce today that we are raising our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share. This is the 10th consecutive annual increase since our separation in 2015 and reflects the confidence we and our board have in our long-term outlook ahead. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touchtone phone.\nIf you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, press star one again. We also ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up. We'll take our first question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from B of A. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, B of A\n\nYes, thank you so much. I guess to start, your free cash flow guide for next year is flat year on year despite the margin pressures you alluded to from increased memory pricing. What are some of the elements offsetting these headwinds in cash flows? Does the $2.9 billion in free cash flow include any cash restructuring charges? I will follow up.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nYeah, thanks, Wamsi, for your question. We obviously remain focused on driving value to our shareholders through strong free cash flow.\nLike we're doing with our earnings guide, we're taking a prudent approach to our expectations there, particularly the recently projected increase in memory costs. At this point, we expect our free cash flow to be relatively flat, as you said, with slightly lower earnings. That's offset by improvements in working capital, primarily due to the favorable cash conversion cycle we have with the expectations of our growing PS business. We also expect CapEx and restructuring costs to be down slightly year over year. I would just say in free cash flow, as always, if we can do better, we will.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYes, it includes the funds for the restructuring activities.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nYes, we expect for the year, the restructuring costs to be roughly $250 million.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, B of A\n\nOkay, great. Maybe, Enrique, we've seen plenty of memory cycles in the past.\nThis one is fairly unprecedented in rate and pace of change. I'm just wondering, as you think about the various strategies you're going to deploy to navigate this, how do you think about price elasticity in a somewhat weaker consumer market? How do you think about despecking and any other sort of strategies that HP could deploy in terms of being able to raise price without sort of impacting the demand elasticity, if that's at all possible? What are some of the things that you're looking at executing to limit this impact to what you quantified about $0.30 or so? Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nThank you. As you said, this is not the first time we go through a situation like that. The team has plenty of experience handling these situations. I think the first thing that helps us in this situation is our scale.\nBy using our scale, we have today a good supply position thanks to the long-term agreements and the relationships we have with many suppliers. We are using that also to qualify additional suppliers to mitigate this even further. We also can use the breadth of our portfolio to make sure that customers get the right configuration and to descale in those cases where it's possible to balance company profitability with experience from customers. Something unique that we have this time is something that I have been mentioning before, which is the Workforce Experience Platform. This is a tool that we deploy to our commercial customers that allows PIOs to monitor the performance of individual users. By using telemetry data that we have been capturing over time, we can make recommendations on what is the optimum configuration per customer.\nThis will help us significantly for those customers that, when we deploy the tool, to make sure that they get the right solution and the right memory configuration. What we have seen in the past in these situations, from a demand perspective, are usually the more low-end categories, those that are impacted. By managing our portfolio and shifting demand to the areas where we think we will have more product available and better configurations, it's an important way for us to manage that. Finally, of course, pricing will be another tool to mitigate the impact, and we will use this as soon as we can, given the contracts and the different relationships that we have.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of David Boat with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Luke\n\nAssociate Director, UBS\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nThis is Brian Luke on for David. Just on the topic of higher memory prices, you talked about a number of actions you could take staying on the topic of pricing. Now, would you consider price increases across the entire portfolio, or would you consider them more tactical in nature? Would you be able to quantify any price increases you'd be considering going forward? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYeah, I would say we are going to be looking at it case by case, country by country, category by category. The impact on memory cost is significant. I would say it's going to happen across the board, but more selectively or higher or lower depending on specific situations.\n\nBrian Luke\n\nAssociate Director, UBS\n\nGot it. That's helpful. In regards to the Windows 11 refresh, you talked about us being roughly 60% of the way through.\nAccording to our checks, that's roughly in line. You expect it to be a tailwind going forward in fiscal year 2026. Do you expect it to be a tailwind for longer than that time period? Would you expect tariff considerations to be having an impact going forward? Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYes, you heard it right. We estimate that about 60% of the install base have moved to Windows 11. We have seen the conversion happening faster in the enterprise space and also in North America. The biggest opportunity now is going to be in SMB, in Europe, and in Asia. This is very consistent with previous processes. In terms of the tailwind, if you think about what has been the conversion during the last quarter, it has been about 10 points.\nThis can give you a prediction of for how long we think this is going to last, for sure, for the first half of the year, probably beyond that.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nWe also have the catalyst of AIPCs being a continued uptick as we look ahead too. We had about 30% or more than 30% of our shipments being AIPCs in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be higher next year, 40% to 50%.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nIrvin Liu\n\nStock Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. I wanted to understand the rationale behind the company cost savings initiative that was announced today, since you already recently completed the Future Ready program.\nWas this new initiative more of a response to higher memory costs, or should we view this as kind of a broader cost savings program in nature?\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYes. I actually started to talk about this in the last earnings call. This was way before the memory cycle started. This is really driven by the opportunity that we think AI is going to bring us to accelerate product development, improve customer satisfaction, and also boost productivity. Two years ago, we started to do some pilots on how AI could help us to drive these things. During the last two quarters, we have been shifting from pilots to specific initiatives in areas where we can have significant impact. What we have learned is that we need to start from redesigning the process.\nOnce we know how the process could be done using AI, using agentic AI can really have a very significant impact. This is why we think that, really, over the next years, this can have a very significant impact across areas I mentioned before: faster product development, customer satisfaction, and also productivity. We have quantified productivity around $1 billion over the next three years. This is really what we have deployed now and what we are working with the teams to deliver on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Somik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Cardoso\n\nVP of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Somik. Maybe just wanted to follow up on kind of the PS momentum or PC momentum you're thinking about or seeing going into 2026.\nI was curious if you could just flesh out the conviction here, particularly as we're cycling past the bulk of the Windows 11 refresh. I know, Antonio, you talked about 60% or 50%+ of the install base moved over. There's some headroom there to continue. Interestingly enough, when you guys talked about the forecast for next year, it seemed like pricing was a bigger contributor for the next year relative to this year, where I think units were bigger. I'm just curious where you guys are seeing that dynamic play out and what's kind of the conviction behind it. I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYes. The conviction comes from the same drivers that we have seen driving demand during the last few quarters.\nWe have an aged install base of PCs that need to be refreshed, of all the PCs that were bought four or five years ago. We have the opportunity driven by the change to Windows 11, and we have seen that tailwind helping us during the last quarter. As you said, the conversion has been done to 60% of the install base, so we have still close to 40% of the install base to be converted, especially in SMB and especially outside of North America. This will be a tailwind now for several quarters. We also see the opportunity to continue to improve the mix of AI PCs that has exceeded the expectations that we had for the year. All these will be positive drivers.\nOn top of that, our strategy is going to continue to be focused on premium categories, as it has been during the last few quarters, where we have made very significant progress both in commercial customers, consumer customers, and workstations. We also have an opportunity to continue to drive a touch of peripherals, a touch of services. All these kind of will help us to drive revenue growth faster than unit growth in 2026.\n\nJoe Cardoso\n\nVP of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Maybe follow-up for Karen. Just curious if you could share any thoughts on how you're thinking about seasonality for next year.\nSeems like a lot of moving pieces with the company cycling past the tariffs of this year, maybe the bulk of the Windows 11 refresh this year, and then kind of entering a dynamic memory pricing environment, just to kind of name a few of the things that are going on, obviously. Anything we should keep on top of mind relative to maybe first half, second half dynamics, relative to revenues? I know you talked about the margin implications as you kind of cycle past some of the inventory that you built on the memory side. Any other moving pieces we should think about as we're thinking about our models for next year in terms of some of the different dynamics we should be considering, just given that we've been in somewhat of a volatile or moving pieces environment? Thanks for the question, everyone.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nThanks, Joe.\nHappy to talk about that. I did mention that we anticipate our revenue to be stronger in the second half of the year. That's really just driven by normal seasonality, as well as pricing as needed against the tariffs and the rising costs. When you look at our margins, we expect our print operating margins to be in line with seasonality, where we see Q3 typically lower seasonally than the rest. On PS, as we talked about, we expect our PS operating profit rate to stay in the 5% to 6% range in the first half of the year. With higher memory cost increases in our back half, we said we expected our full year rate to be at the low end of our long-term 5% to 7% range.\nGiven that, we could see Q3 and Q4 temporarily below that 5% range. As you know, we're working to minimize that and ultimately mitigate the full impact. If we can do better, we will. When you think about it from an EPS perspective, we typically have EPS more stronger in the back half. With the impact of memory in the back half of this year, you can think about EPS being more evenly weighted through the year. Hopefully, that helps.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nMaybe let me add a couple of comments on the memory side. As we said in our prepared remarks, we expect the major impact of the memory cost increases to impact the second half of the year. In fact, almost no impact in the first half, given the inventories on hand that we have.\nI think it's important to have in mind that we are one of the first companies that are guiding for the full year. The impact we really see on the second half, we don't see it in the first half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I was wondering, Karen and Enrique, if you could just expand a little bit about the comment around the growing base of services, subscriptions, and software that are more contractual in nature. Was that a comment more about workforce solutions or print subscriptions? Appreciate the highlight. Just if you could expand on anything that you're thinking about in the future, that would be helpful in how you would work to grow that type of business. Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nYes. It's a comment across the board.\nWe have seen very solid growth, for example, in the consumer subscriptions side of Instant Ink. We mentioned that business is approaching $1 billion, which is really a significant milestone for these types of businesses. We have also seen very solid growth in the workforce solutions space, especially in PCs, in PCs as a service, that has driven very significant growth during 2025 and that we expect to continue to see in 2026. Also, our software businesses are having very strong performance. I will let Karen make a few comments.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nYeah, I would just add that we're excited to drive even greater growth and value in the future with revenue that is less cyclical, more stable, and higher margins. It's really an important focus for us at the company.\nIt means that as we innovate products and develop new business models around them, we'll be focused on driving more recurring revenue. When we think about doing our capital allocation too, this is going to be a priority focus for us. I would say it's not something that's going to change rapidly overnight. We see this as an important gradual transition, and we'll just continue to highlight it for investors.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you. If I could just follow up around the headwind for memory of $0.30 on EPS net of mitigations, what do you think the gross impact is? What's your confidence level on the mitigations? Could it be better or worse? Just as a quick follow-up, are you also seeing similar kind of tightness on PCB and kind of inflation related to that? Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nSure.\nLet me start on the quantification. We have shared enough numbers that you can calculate. We have shared that the cost of memory is between 15% and 18% of PCs. From there, you can calculate the gross impact that you will see is significantly bigger than the $0.30 that we are quantifying. We have fairly high confidence in the actions that we have put in place. In fact, we mentioned that we have been conservative in the guide for the full year, and that based on the actions I described before, if we can do better, we will be better. Given that we are guiding the full year and we expect to see the majority of the impact in the second half, we thought it was important to be prudent at this point.\nIn terms of other components, this is the area where we see the biggest impact: memories and storage. The rest of the space, we are confident and we do not see any shortages at this point. As I said before, even in the memory and storage space, we are in a good position from a supply perspective, given the relationships and the contracts we have with our suppliers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Aussie Emergent with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Cadiz\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz on behalf of Aussie Emergent at Citi. My question is on AIPC penetration. Despite you hitting the 25% to 30% penetration ahead of schedule, how do you think that tariffs and now the elevated commodity costs have affected the expected trajectory toward the 50% in the coming years that you have telegraphed?\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nWe continue to be very optimistic about the penetration of AIPCs. As I mentioned before, we will be prioritizing premium categories as we will be working on the memory situation next year. The penetration of AIPCs, as I said before, is above 30% today at the end of the quarter. It's really driven by the additional value these PCs bring compared to the install base, and the fact that our customers want to be ready as soon as applications start taking advantage of the capabilities of these products. Last quarter, I mentioned the work that we are doing with software companies to leverage those. This work has continued, and we have continued to make progress.\nWith the announcements that Microsoft made last week on the consumer side, the ability to manage PCs with voice, I think, are going to be exciting, very exciting for our consumers. They have improved the tools that they have for other companies to take advantage of GPUs and NPUs in the devices. We have made progress with other software companies like Adobe in leveraging those assets, with more local vendors like Rakuten or in Japan, to take their models and the systems that they have in the cloud and bring them to the edge, an announcement we made a few weeks ago. We have also worked with smaller companies that drive very specific value, for example, in helping sales teams to be more efficient or in helping product managers to present better. All these are really helping to drive adoption.\nSomething we think very relevant is, as we have deployed these solutions internally in HP with not only the PCs, but with accurate sets of applications, we have seen up to 17% of productivity improvement. This is a very important value proposition for us, but also for our customers.\n\nMike Cadiz\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThank you for that. As my follow-up, for both PC and print, would you mind talking about the customer and market reception to the pricing actions that you've taken and whether or not it's differed between consumer and commercial, and how you perhaps balance that with maintaining margins and share as well? Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nSure. The majority of, I mean, if I look at print, we have done price actions both in the consumer and commercial space.\nIn the commercial space, probably because most of our competitors are Japanese and they continue to have a very significant help from yen, we didn't see these changes happening across the board. This is why we lost some share in Q4. It didn't happen in consumer. It didn't happen in supplies, where we grew our share, especially in supplies where we grew our share. In the PC space, our price increases have been smaller because the impact of tariffs so far has been smaller. Therefore, we haven't seen a strong reaction one way or another. Prices have grown year on year, quarter on quarter, but less than what we have seen in other spaces.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nEven with this pricing environment, you're seeing us have strong revenue performance both last quarter and for the full year. We expect that to continue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMaya Neuman\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thank you. This is Maya Neuman on for Erik Woodring. Maybe just to start to build on some of your comments regarding your mitigation tactics for the memory cycle and your supplier relationships, could you quantify how many weeks of memory inventory you have on hand? Are suppliers willing to sign long-term agreements? Kind of just overall, where do you believe HP is most differentiated within the supply chain or has the greatest competitive differentiation versus peers to weather this memory cycle? Thank you. I have a follow-up.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nSure.\nI'm not going to share the specifics of the weeks of inventory we have, but I said before that given the inventory we have today, we are fairly well in a fairly good situation for the first half of the year. This helps you to understand that it's not going to have a short-term impact. In terms of long-term agreements, we have long-term agreements with our key suppliers, and the scale, the depth of our relationships are key assets when we go through situations like this. As you know, also after COVID, we made a lot of work to improve our operational processes within supply chain, both in terms of supply demand matching, in terms of forecasting. They will be very useful now as we need to go through this situation because it's not only about getting the memory.\nIt's also about getting other supplies that will work with memory, like processors. It's about aligning demand to that. We did a lot of work during the last quarters of COVID to improve that. The team is very experienced now in how to manage this situation.\n\nMaya Neuman\n\nEquity Research Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you very much. Last question for me. If we take a step back and think about your overarching strategy in print, how should we think about it going forward? I understand we'll probably get more details at the analyst day. It's obviously a secularly declining business. You're also seeing operating income decline in print as well on a dollar basis, which I know a lot of actions around pricing, Big Ink, toner, subscriptions, the graphics market, are meant to protect. Is this a business where we should expect operating income growth?\nIf so, how do we get there on a sustainable basis? Thank you.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nAs we said, we will talk more about this in our investor day in a few months. The strategy that we have been executing during the last years is not changing. Our goal continues to be to capture more value per customer and reduce the number of unprofitable customers, which we have been doing during the last years. Our shift or our doubling down on Big Ink is a consequence of that strategy as well. We see a big opportunity to grow profitable units in that space while at the same time continue to accelerate and continue to drive the transition into subscriptions in this space. We have been making very good progress both on the supply side and now also integrating printers in our all-in program.\nIn the office space, we see an opportunity to grow our share in profitable units. The new portfolio that we will be launching during 2026 and the work that we continue to do in cost will help us to achieve that goal. Finally, on the industrial space, especially in the graphic side, it's a business that has been growing during the last nine quarters, and we expect it to continue to grow during 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mark, you might be on mute.\n\nMark Newman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nApologies. Apologies. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, yeah. Just following up a bit on the memory price environment, thanks very much for the clarity on the $0.30 impact. Just curious, though, you mentioned that's mostly on the back half.\nPresumably, if you just do the math, $0.30 on $3 or so annual earnings, your impact is more than 10% on the back half. Considering, of course, you can pass through a lot of that with pricing, it seems like it should be less given you have quite a few months to correct pricing. Just wondering if anything I'm thinking about is wrong there. This seems like it may be conservative from you on the $0.30, but let me know if I'm thinking about that wrong. I also wanted to ask, does it have an impact on mix given how significant memory prices have moved? Could specs change, average specs of what you sell change? Could that also impact the AIPC dynamic considering that AIPCs typically have higher specs? Thanks very much. Yeah.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, HP\n\nThanks for the question, Mark.\nLet me just talk about the $0.30 and the guide. I would just say we remain focused on taking a prudent approach to our guidance, and particularly as we start a new year, we're setting our guidance at a level that we have a high confidence in meeting, and hopefully exceeding. I would say we're taking that same prudent approach this year with the rising cost of memory, but we've already been implementing actions to mitigate. I would note that we have a proven track record of managing challenges like this, and we are confident in the strength of our organizations and the partnerships that we've built to deliver the best possible outcomes. While we have included that $0.30 in the guide, if we can do better, we certainly will. Your math is roughly right.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP\n\nFinally, in terms of configuration, as I said before, we are going to be prioritizing those units where we see more margin for the company. What we have seen in other cases is where volumes are more impacted, are more in the entry space, where customers are usually more sensitive to price. As Karen said before, we decided to take a conservative approach. We are guiding now the full year. We think the impact will be mostly on the second half, and we are taking a lot of actions to mitigate that impact. Given how fast things have unfolded during the last few weeks, again, we thought it was better to be prudent at this stage.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude our question and answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Enrique for any closing comments.\n\nEnrique Lores\n\nPresident and CEO, HP",
    "content2": "Perfect.\nThank you, everybody, for joining today's call. We remain confident in our ability to lead the future of work through technology. I'm really proud of the progress we have made across our priorities. We finished 2025 strong, growing profit from the first half to the second. In 2026, we intend to grow faster than the market. We have a significant opportunity to embed AI in everything we do and transform the company. The memory headwinds that we have been talking today, while material, are also temporary. We're taking action. We have managed, as we said also, such challenges before, and we have a lot of experience on how to handle that. With a clear strategy and disciplined execution, we are focused on driving long-term value while managing these headwinds. Again, thank you for joining today.\nFor those of you in the US, we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving holiday. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.\nWe posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Let me start by saying we made solid progress against our goals and key strategic initiatives in Q3. We continue to execute with discipline and focus, delivering on our commitments and advancing our ambition to be a leader in the future of work. Today, we will take a closer look at our third quarter performance, highlight some of our newest innovations and discuss our Q4 outlook.\nBeginning with our performance. I am pleased to report that we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Q3. Top line revenue increased 3% year-over-year driven by strong performance in Personal Systems. This momentum was fueled by continued Windows 11 refresh, AITC adoption and services growth. We also drove collective double-digit growth year-over-year and sequentially in our key growth areas.\nOur operating fleet margins for both print and personal systems were in line with our guidance. And non-GAAP EPS was slightly above the midpoint of our guide reflecting a sequential improvement of 6%. These results demonstrate our ability to execute our plan and adapt quickly to the evolving trade environment. We are on track to reach our future-ready gross annualized savings of $2 billion by the end of fiscal year '25, which we expect will help drive continued improvements in operating profit.\nAt the same time, we are making solid progress on our actions to mitigate higher trade-related costs including manufacturing diversification, cost reduction and pricing adjustments. This quarter, as planned, nearly all products sold in North America are now built outside of China helping to further reduce trade-related costs. We continue to ramp up production across Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico and the U.S.\nMost importantly, we have done what we said we would. We have demonstrated we can remain agile in responding to external pressures while staying focused on our long-term strategy. Now let me share more color on the performance of each business unit. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, above our expectations. We continue to shift our mix to higher-value segments such as AI PC, commercial premium and services. We saw strong year-over-year growth in both commercial and consumer segments.\nCommercial performance was supported by the Windows 11 refresh and increased AI PC adoption. We are very pleased with accelerating demand for the AI PC category, which grew revenue double digit sequentially. It has surpassed our expectations with shipments continue to ramp, now reaching over 25% of our mix, a quarter ahead of our plan. Consumer growth was supported by a strong back-to-school season.\nIn our key growth areas, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in advanced compute solutions. In Services, momentum continued with strong revenue growth year-over-year, driven mainly by digital services and managed services. Yes, we did see softer demand in hybrid systems as companies are delaying some of their IT projects. Our installed base, active AI PC users is growing significantly and positioning as well for future AI-driven innovations.\nWe are seeing strong momentum in the AI PC ecosystem with a number of software companies introducing solutions growing by double digits quarter-over-quarter. We are working closely with Microsoft and silicon providers to capture the opportunity created by the AI PC platform. Key ISV partners such as Adobe and Zoom are shifting workloads locally to take advantage of the NPU. We grew share in high-value categories especially in premium segments. This includes year-over-year and sequential gains in PC commercial premium, consumer premium and AI PCs. Last quarter, we committed to actions to return our Personal Systems operating margin to its long-term target rate.\nI am pleased to report we achieved that delivering an operating margin back into our target range. Turning to Print. Revenue declined 3% in constant currency, as expected. Our key growth areas in Print continued to perform well and had strong growth year-over-year, while we continue to take actions to mitigate the increase in trade-related costs we saw overall a more aggressive pricing environment.\nDemand in the office segment was slightly softer than anticipated, particularly across North America and parts of Europe. However, we maintained our share position in office, and we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. In home, we maintain discipline in a competitive pricing environment. Supply's revenue performed as expected. Diving deeper into our key growth areas Consumer subscriptions had a strong ramp in new subscribers of our all-in plant.\nWe had key wins with workforce solutions in industries such as finance, manufacturing retail and public sector. We saw another quarter of strong growth in industrial graphics with share gains year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Now let's take a closer look at recent innovations that are positioning us as a leader in the future of work. In Q3, we advanced our portfolio of AI-powered solutions that help businesses direct growth and employees achieved professional fulfillment.\nOn the commercial side, our AI PC lineup received industry recognition. Our Elite Book Ultra was named top AI PC in the CRM Tech Innovator Award. It was noted for its design, performance and impact on productivity. Our workforce experience platform was recognized in the enterprise IT management category placed for its ability to reduce digital friction and improve IT agency. Since launch, the platform has been deployed in 40 countries, and we plan to expand to more than 30 additional countries in the coming months.\nWe are redefining how people connect and collaborate. We introduced HP dimension with Google Beam a video communication tool that uses 6 cameras and AI to generate 3D video of participants designed to enhance remote collaboration. And we are excited to bring advanced AI capabilities to a broader audience with our Omni Book 5 notebook.\nFor the [ prosumer, ] it delivers high performance and up to 34 hours of battery life, empowering customers to stay productive longer. In our print portal, we are integrating AI to drive intelligent automation and customer-centric design. HP Neo, an AI-powered chat bot for industrial print is helping print shops improve production efficiency. In large format, HP build workspace and AI vectorization tool helps architecture, engineering and construction professionals reduced drafting time by up to 80%.\nResponsible innovation and sustainability are foundational to our future of work efforts, and we continue to demonstrate meaningful measurable impact. Today, 99% of HP home and office printers, desktops, notebooks, displays and workstations incorporate recycled content. We have reached 100% renewable electricity across our U.S. operations, marking a significant step toward our net 0 goal.\nAnd in partnership with [indiscernible] we're establishing digital hubs that have already reached over 700,000 people worldwide, helping them succeed in the digital age. In addition, HP is pleased to support the white house initiative to advance AI education for America's youth. This is an important step toward equipping the next generation with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work.\nAs we look ahead, we remain confident in the strength of the PC market in 2025. We expect the market to grow mid-single digits in the second half with continued strong momentum from Windows 11 Refresh and the AI PC adoption. We believe this catalyst will continue to drive PC market growth in 2026. We expect the print market to decline low single digits in 2025 and at a similar level in 2026. However, our strategy is focused on protecting the operating profit contribution of the premium business to the company.\nWe will continue focusing on reducing unprofitable units by shifting to big tank, increasing lifetime customer profitability through growth in our consumer subscription business gaining share in the higher value office categories, growing our key growth areas and maintaining cost discipline. AI is also opening new possibilities to transform how we operate and compete.\nBeyond driving structural cost reductions, we see tremendous potential to automate additional workflows, streamline decision-making and accelerate innovation across the business. These capabilities will help us reduce complexity and drive lower costs. You will hear more about this from us in the quarters ahead. Externally, we recognize there is continued uncertainty in the global trade environment.\nWe have planned for today's landscape and have proven our ability to respond quickly to any future changes. Through our actions, we have strengthened our operational agility and have full confidence in our ability to navigate evolving conditions. As we continue to adapt to this dynamic environment, engagement with investors is a top priority. We are looking forward to sharing our long-term plans during our Investor Day in early 2026.\nThere will provide updates on our progress and explore the exciting opportunities ahead to advance our strategy. Before I close, I want to thank our employees for their dedication, resilience and customer-first mindset, which have been key to our progress. We know what it takes to the results and be a leader in the future of work, and we are executing with focus. Now let me hand it over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the progress we've made in the quarter to advance our strategy to lead the future of work, while navigating an evolving market environment and delivering on our financial commitments. We drove another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued momentum in Personal Systems, fueled by AI PC and in Win 11 refresh activity and strong performance in our key growth areas. In fact, we delivered double-digit sequential growth in Personal Systems, resulting in strong free cash flow in the quarter. In Print and PS, we executed decisively on the actions we laid out to mitigate trade-related headwinds and are pleased with the meaningful progress we made in the quarter including accelerating supply chain resiliency, cost reduction and pricing actions.\nAs a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in Q3 while delivering operating margins within our expected ranges for both businesses and non-GAAP EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 3% year-over-year, both nominally and in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, Americas and EMEA each grew 1%. And APJ was up 11%, with particularly strong Personal Systems performance in China.\nGross margin was 20.5%, down year-over-year with a higher mix from Personal Systems increased trade-related costs and unfavorable currency impacts. We offset those headwinds in part with disciplined pricing actions and cost management. As anticipated, non-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year. We drove our future-ready cost plans and maintained strong expense management while importantly investing in growth with key strategic and go-to-market initiatives.\nAll in, our non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1%, down year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 954 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.75 and our GAAP earnings per share was $0.80 helped by favorable tax adjustments in the quarter.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of solid growth in Personal Systems. With revenue up 6%, above our expectations on 5% unit growth and increased ASPs. We continue to shift the mix towards premium categories while executing disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate cost increases.\nSequentially, revenue was up 10% and units were up 13% on seasonal strength and overall share gains. And momentum continued in our key growth areas, with strong performance in AI PCs, advanced compute and Workforce Solutions, offset in part by softness in hybrid systems. We drove commercial revenue up 5% on 3% unit growth with favorable pricing and a mix shift toward premium. Consistent with our strategy, we gained share in Windows-based commercial PCs as refresh activity fueled by Win 11 and AI PC continued.\nConsumer revenue and units grew 8% and with strong performance in North America, along with China driven by gaming and robust back-to-school seasonality and share gains drove consumer units up 34% sequentially. Importantly, as promised, we Personal Systems operating margin back into our guidance range at 5.4% with our planned mitigation actions. Turning to Print. Our results reflect a slightly softer-than-expected office market and a price environment that remained competitive despite rising trade-related costs across the industry. In this dynamic environment, we maintained our focus on profitable unit placement, prioritization of higher-value categories and disciplined cost management.\nWe also drove strong performance in key growth areas, including double-digit growth in consumer subscriptions and strong performance in Industrial, fueled by double-digit hardware growth. Looking at the details. Print revenue declined 4% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency, with market-driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial. Supplies performed as expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we continue to drive market share gains and favorable pricing that partially offset installed base and usage headwinds.\nAnd in line with our guidance, we delivered an operating margin of 17.3%, solidly within our target range and flat year-over-year. as we offset increased trade-related costs with pricing actions and cost reductions. Turning to our future-ready cost plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes leveraging AI capabilities internally to drive automation and optimization of processes to better support our customers, partners and employees.\nWe are well on track to hit our total program goal of at least $2 billion in annualized gross run rate savings by the end of our fiscal year. These incremental structural savings enable our continued investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation as well as to help us to mitigate macro uncertainties. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated approximately $1.7 billion in cash from operations in the quarter and roughly $1.5 billion in free cash flow.\nIn line with our expectations. We also improved our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up with higher manufacturing activity. Lastly, we returned more than $400 million to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we signaled at the beginning of the quarter, our leverage ratio remained slightly above our target range. So in line with our stated framework, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution.\nOf course, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as gross leverage remains under 2x, and there aren't better return opportunities. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution. While maintaining the agility needed to respond to changes in a fluid environment. Our Q4 guide takes into account current global tariff rates as well as the market growth expectations that Enrique has covered.\nBy segment, in Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality. Driven by the typical holiday uptick in consumer continued Windows 11 refresh and AI PC adoption. And we expect Personal Systems margin to be solidly in our 5% to 7% target range. improving sequentially as the mitigation actions we have taken gained full traction in the quarter. In Print, we also expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality and operating margin to be near the top of our 16% to 19% range, reflecting a higher supplies mix along with disciplined pricing and cost management, offset in part by increased trade-related costs.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for fiscal year '25, including approximately $400 million in cash restructuring charges for the year. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain consistent with prior periods. Of note, we appreciate the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act which will help keep our tax rate more consistent and enable continued investment in long-term growth opportunities. With all of this, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS and to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.97 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85.\nLooking beyond Q4, we expect continued momentum in the refresh catalyst driving growth in the PC market, and we are confident in the measures we are taking to capitalize on opportunities in the print market and to protect operating profit. I will share more on our fiscal '26 outlook on our Q4 earnings call. In closing, we delivered solid results in the quarter, while executing well against our strategic initiatives. We are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to enable us to respond swiftly to near-term market dynamics while continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Second Quarter '25 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.\nAs always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.

HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory and market share references are based on calendar quarter information. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Against the backdrop of a highly dynamic landscape, we delivered another quarter of solid top line growth driven by continued momentum in the Personal Systems Commercial business. However, due to additional tariff costs that could not be fully mitigated in the quarter, our non-GAAP operating profit fell short of expectations.\nToday, we will take a deeper dive into Q2 performance, the evolving external environment and our outlook. I will also highlight new innovations we introduced to drive our momentum forward. Let me start with our Q2 results.\nOverall, we delivered revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter with a 5% increase in constant currency year-over-year. We saw strong growth in Personal Systems, particularly in Commercial and high-value categories, driving momentum in our key growth areas. These meaningful results show that our Future of Work strategy is working.\nNonetheless, the rapidly changing external landscape, including shift in trade policies and additional tariffs, had a net impact of approximately 100 basis points on our non-GAAP operating profit, mainly in April and primarily impacting Personal Systems. This resulted in a roughly $0.12 impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. By net impact, we are referring to all tariff-related impacts after taking into account the mitigation actions.\nWe swiftly responded to these changing market dynamics and were able to partially offset them in the quarter through cost actions, pricing and accelerating the transition of our manufacturing footprint. We continue to diversify our manufacturing locations so that we can best respond to geopolitical changes with agility. We have expanded our manufacturing footprint for both PCs and printers to different locations and we recently increased our production coming from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico and the U.S.\nBy the end of June, we now expect literally all of our products sold in North America will be built outside of China, significantly accelerating our previous plan. However, it takes time and investment to fully mitigate such impacts. Let me now share more color on our business unit performance.\nIn Personal Systems, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, above our expectations, driven by strong commercial performance. PC Commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year, including strong growth in North America and Asia. As expected, we saw continued strength in AI PC demand and the Windows 11 Refresh. And we believe that momentum will carry forward.\nWe drove share gains year-over-year in Commercial PC, particularly in premium, workstations, AI PCs and Gaming. We drove growth in services with several new wins in health care, financial services and retail. Personal Systems operating margin came in below our guidance, largely due to higher tariffs that were not fully offset by our actions in the quarter. We expect to successfully mitigate this cost and return to our long-term target range of 5% to 7% next quarter.\nIn Print, revenue declined 3% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We saw revenue growth across home and office in Europe, helping to offset a slowdown in North America and continued weak demand in China. And we continue to drive momentum in home with units up 2%, fueled by strong Big Tank growth. We grew share year-over-year in developed markets, optimizing profitable share, mainly in office A4 value and AV.\nIn our key growth areas for Print, we saw continued growth in consumer subscriptions and workforce solutions, and we drove another quarter of growth in industrial graphics, supported by the portfolio launched at Drupa, confirming the high adoption of our new product introductions. Our focus remains on what we can control, executing with discipline, supporting our customers and making strategic decisions that position HP for the long term.\nNow let's turn to the significant strides we made in innovation. This quarter, we advanced our strategy to lead the Future of Work by delivering experiences that help businesses grow and employees find greater professional fulfillment. At our global AMPLIFY conference in March, we deepened relationships with over 1,100 partners and customers. We unveiled more than 80 new products and services, and the positive reactions from attendees reaffirmed our direction.\nA key highlight was the global rollout of the HP Workforce Experience platform, combining AI with real-time insights, this forward solution enables CIOs to boost productivity and address issues before they disrupt work. Feedback from our early adopters has been incredibly positive, highlighting the platform's impact on workplace efficiency and its role in improving employee satisfaction.\nTo accelerate the adoption of AI and bring its benefits to the mainstream, we introduced one of the most comprehensive AI PC portfolios in the industry. This portfolio features the redesigned HP EliteBook and EliteDesk engineered to help people work smart and faster while keeping their data secure.\nTo enhance advanced workflows for data scientists and AI developers, we teamed up with NVIDIA to launch the HP ZGX AI Station, a high-performance workstation powered by Blackwell and designed to accelerate productivity and enhance security.\nIn Print, we are leading the way in security with our new LaserJet Enterprise devices, the first printers in the world designed to guard against quantum computer attacks. And our industrial print team received 5 prestigious European Digital Press Award, recognizing our bold vision to lead the industry for automation, productivity and sustainability.\nIn April, we brought our latest generation of latest technology to life engineered to simplify production and optimize printing processes. Third, we have our print hub software print shops can now drive greater efficiency and control from a single platform. This innovation played a pivotal role in our recent collaboration with Scuderia Ferrari, where we co-engineered a high-performance car prop that's up to 14% lighter and 17% thinner, translating breakthrough technology into real-world speed. The advancements across our entire portfolio this quarter demonstrate our [indiscernible] in creating a secure and powerful AI stack that connects device data and workflows to drive meaningful productivity.\nIn Q2, we acted quickly to address tariff-related headwinds, taking decisive steps like accelerating our manufacturing rebalancing, redesigning our logistics network, shift in sourcing and qualifying new product configurations. This effort both strengthen our operational agility and led the foundation for continued resilience. We will carry this momentum into Q3 and Q4 as we further reinforce our supply chain and operational capabilities.\nAdditionally, we have implemented price increases to help offset cost pressure. While these decisions are never taken lightly, they are essential to maintaining our financial discipline. Looking ahead, the remainder of fiscal 2025 will be shaped by a range of factors, some of which remain uncertain. We have planned for today's tariff landscape, and if it changes, we will respond swiftly as we did in Q2.\nWe continue to expect the PC market will grow in 2025, but softer than originally planned, driven by increased macro uncertainty. That said, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and gain share.\nIn Print, we continue to expect the market to decline low single digits for calendar year 2025. We expect the actions we are taking to gain full traction in the second half, leading to sequential operating profit improvement. We are making progress with execution of the future-ready accelerated plan that we announced last quarter, and we are now expecting to exceed our goal and deliver at least $2 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by the end of fiscal year '25. This incremental [ actual ] savings will help mitigate macro and geopolitical uncertainties while continuing to support investments in strategic areas.\nWe are confident in our ability to navigate an evolving market. We have always excelled in managing complex environment. We have an incredible team capable of optimizing processes, implementing best practices and achieving global efficiency. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. Our focus on harnessing the power of AI to make work more personal, productive and fulfilling will drive our success now and into the future.\nLet me now hand it over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid top line growth driven by continued momentum in the Personal Systems commercial business, aligned with our vision of leading the Future of Work. We executed our strategy across multiple fronts, including growing share in high-value categories across Personal Systems and Print, driving momentum in our key growth areas and exercising disciplined cost management while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives.\nHowever, against the backdrop of a dynamic geopolitical landscape, our non-GAAP operating profit fell short of expectations due to additional tariff costs that could not be fully mitigated in the quarter. As a reminder, our guidance for Q2 included tariffs in place at the time. While we plan for a range of scenarios in the quarter and we worked aggressively to respond to changes in the regulatory trade environment, the tariff increases announced in April were higher than expected. That said, as you heard from Enrique, we made meaningful progress expanding our supply chain and manufacturing footprint, and we accelerated actions on cost reduction and pricing.\nHowever, as we indicated last quarter, the full benefit of these mitigating actions can take a few months lead time depending on the scope. So in the quarter, our operating margin was impacted by net tariff costs, mainly in Personal Systems.\nTaking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 3% nominally and 5% in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, APJ grew 9%, Americas grew 5% and EMEA grew 1%. And while we made progress on the cost of good reduction actions we started at the beginning of the year, gross margin at 20.7% was down year-over-year with increased tariff and commodity costs. We drove non-GAAP operating expenses down year-over-year to help offset, including driving future-ready cost savings, continuing disciplined cost management and reducing variable compensation.\nAll in, our operating margin of 7.3% was impacted by roughly 100 basis points due to unmitigated tariff and related impacts, mainly in Personal Systems. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations, with lower short-term borrowing costs offset by currency losses.\nFinally, with a diluted share count of approximately 956 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.71, reflecting the tariff and related impacts net of mitigations of approximately $0.12.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. We delivered another quarter of solid growth in Personal Systems with revenue up 7% nominally and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations and driven by higher Commercial volumes and increased ASPs. We did see some demand pull forward, but estimate it was minimal, accounting for less than 1% of our revenue growth. As we signaled, we drove disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate increased tariff and component costs and shifted mix toward premium categories. And momentum continued in our key growth areas, with strong performance in AI PCs, Advanced Compute and Workforce Solutions.\nWe also drove commercial unit growth of 11%, gaining share overall and in premium categories as the market momentum and refresh activity continued. Commercial revenue increased 9% year-over-year with pricing actions and mix shift toward premium offset in part by currency impacts.\nIn Consumer, our results reflect our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix. We saw 2% revenue growth on lower volume through favorable pricing and mix shift, including share gains and gaming. Our operating margin in Personal Systems was 4.5%, below the range we guided at the beginning of the quarter and down year-over-year from higher commodity costs and tariff costs that were not yet fully offset by repricing and cost reductions. It's worth noting that excluding the impact of tariff costs, our PS margin would have been well within our 5% to 7% guidance range.\nTurning to Print. Our results were in line with expectations as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement. We increased our market share in high-value categories and drove overall hardware unit growth. Our key growth areas continued to gain momentum, including revenue and subscriber growth and consumer subscriptions and industrial growth fueled by both hardware and supplies. Across Print, revenue declined 3% in constant currency on supplies declines and hardware softness in North America.\nBy customer segment, we grew consumer units 3% year-over-year, led by strong growth in Big Tank. In Commercial, revenue declined 3% year-over-year on a 2% unit decline. We continued our purposeful focus on profitable long-term unit growth, gaining share in the higher-value categories of A4 and A3. Supplies performed as expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we drove favorable pricing and market share gains that were more than offset by installed base and usage headwinds. Yet we delivered strong Print operating margins, up year-over-year and above the high end of our range, reflecting rigorous cost discipline and pricing actions as well as the favorable impact of grant funding received in the quarter.\nWe continue to execute our accelerated future-ready plan across process efficiency, automation, portfolio optimization and operational excellence. And as Enrique mentioned, we now expect to achieve cumulative gross run rate savings of at least $2 billion by the end of fiscal year '25, with no change to our estimated restructuring charges of $1.2 billion for the program. These incremental structural savings continue to be a key lever to help offset macro and geopolitical uncertainties, while also continuing to fuel investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation, all designed to position us well for long-term sustainable growth.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Our cash flow from operations was roughly $38 million in the quarter. And as expected, free cash flow was slightly negative due to the timing of payments for intentional inventory actions we took in the prior quarter as part of our overall tariff mitigation. Those payments resulted in a decrease in DPO and corresponding increase in our cash conversion cycle in Q2, also as expected.\nLastly, we returned close to $400 million to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. A planned debt refinancing ahead of an upcoming maturity contributed to us finishing the quarter slightly above our target leverage range. So in line with our stated policy, with a temporary increase in leverage, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to navigate a dynamic environment that may be impacted by a continuing evolution in global trade policy, broader macroeconomic trends and the associated impact on customer demand. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to moderate our guidance for the second half of the year to reflect this. In our guide, we have accounted for the added cost driven by the current tariffs in place and associated mitigations, including leveraging our supply chain flexibility, future-ready cost reductions and pricing actions. We were able to mitigate part of these costs in Q2, and we are confident that we will fully mitigate them by Q4.\nIn Personal Systems, while we expect to continue to gain share, we now expect the PC market to grow low single digits for both the second half and full calendar year given the uncertain macro environment. We still anticipate Commercial PC catalysts, including the Win 11 Refresh and AI PC adoption to drive solid revenue growth in the back half of the year, and we expect the actions we are taking to offset the cost of tariffs to gain full traction in the second half, leading to sequential improvement in Personal Systems margins in both Q3 and Q4.\nIn Print, we continue to expect the market to decline low single digits for the calendar year, with the second half of the year declining closer to mid-single digits, in line with industry experts. We also expect our operating margin to continue to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range for the year.\nBeyond the segments, we expect Corporate Other to be slightly higher, approaching $1.1 billion as we integrate the operations of our humane asset acquisition into our technology and innovation organization. With this all in, we now expect FY '25 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3 to $3.30 and FY '25 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.62.\nTurning to Q3. In Personal Systems, we expect revenue to grow high single digits sequentially as we continue to see strength in commercial aligned with our future work efforts and pricing actions. And we expect Personal Systems margins in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range, improving sequentially as a result of the mitigation efforts we are driving.\nIn Print, we expect Q3 revenue growth to perform better than typical seasonality on incremental hardware placements and pricing actions. We expect operating margins solidly within our 16% to 19% range as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement, tariff mitigation and disciplined cost management. With all of this, we expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.80 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.69.\nIn line with our revised earnings, particularly in Personal Systems, where we have a negative cash conversion cycle, we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for FY '25. With regard to working capital, we expect our cash conversion cycle to also be impacted by the timing of purposeful actions we are taking to mitigate the fluidity of the tariff situation. It is important to note, however, that we not only expect the impact of these actions on working capital to be temporary, but as mentioned earlier, we also expect to fully mitigate the current cost of tariffs by Q4. And on our balance sheet and capital allocation, given the impact of tariffs, we expect our leverage ratio to continue to be above our target range in Q3. That said, we remain fully committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x and we do not see more attractive investment opportunities.\nIn closing, we responded quickly to the changing market dynamics in the quarter to address headwinds from a rapidly changing trade environment. We remain focused on what we can control and are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to position us for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.\nFor more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials into forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered top line revenue growth, increased momentum across our key growth areas and maintain our focus on positioning HP for long-term success.\nToday, I will focus on 3 main areas: first, our Q1 results and key innovation highlights. Second, a deeper dive on our business unit performance. And finally, I will share our outlook for the year ahead including the actions we are taking to respond to evolving market conditions while continuing to fuel our long-term growth.\nLet me now turn to our Q1 results. Overall, we delivered revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, up 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by growth in our Personal Systems, commercial business and key growth areas. Non-GAAP earnings per share of 74 sales was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.\nOperating profit margins for both Print and Personal Systems were in line with our expectations. These results demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments and execute our strategy to build a stronger HP.\nLast quarter, I outlined our ambition to lead the future of work. We know companies need highly productive workforces to drive growth and employees are seeking fulfillment in the work they do. With our robust portfolio of PCs, printers, peripherals and more, we not only have a unique competitive advantage as we sit at the intersection of this opportunity.\nI am pleased to report we are making solid progress against our strategy. We are doubling down our efforts in the commercial segment and aggressively investing and innovating in new AI and software capabilities. As an example of that, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire strategic assets from [ Human]. Once completed, we will benefit from their AI-powered platform [ Cosmos ] highly skilled technical team and hundreds of patents. With this acquisition, we will accelerate our plans to build an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices, from [ AITCs ] to smart printers and connected conference rooms. We look forward to boosting our technology and innovation organization by integrating the [ Human ] team to HP.\nWe're also realigning our key growth areas to reflect the shift of our investment focus on the future of work. In addition to hybrid systems, workforce solutions consumer subscriptions, industrial graphics and CD, we are now including AI PCs and [ aducompute ] solutions, such as workstations and retail solutions.\nGaming will no longer be one of the key growth areas and will instead be managed as part of our core portfolio because even though it will continue to be a very important business for us, is not directly related to the future of [indiscernible]. Collectively, we expect these realign key growth areas to continue to grow faster than the core and to be accretive to our margins over time.\nTurning to our innovation highlights. In Q1, our vision for the future of work was brought to life at with AI-powered innovations. For example, we announced several new models of AI PC. We are empowering professionals with faster decision-making an effective collaboration with the EliteBook Ultra, adapting to how and where people work best, our EliteBook X offers flexibility and enhanced security protection.\nAnd these new PCs now bring HP's award-winning AI companion to our Intel platforms. And for product designers and data scientists, the [ Zbook Ultra ] recognized with the best laptop award at [ CES ] can help manage complex projects and data sets with ease.\nWe are strengthening the end-to-end experience of hybrid workers with [ under books ] with a quick connect locking experience employees are instantly connected to their workspace before they even sit down at their desk.\nIn gaming, we introduced [indiscernible] AI beta, a groundbreak in [indiscernible] innovation that automatically adjust or optimize performance. Our customer-centric approach also expands our print innovation. To meet the growing demand for convenience, we recently added [ Mark Tank ] printers to our HP all-in subscription plans, is all-inclusive print program has strongly resonated with our customers.\nIn Industrial, we're empowering print providers with new equipment and capabilities. With the introduction of 2 game changes, HP PageWide process, we are delivering high-speed, high-quality prime production.\nAs we continue to innovate, we remain committed to technology that fastest connection improves access and support sustainability. In 2024, HP reached nearly 20 million people through digital equity programs and partnerships. And I am proud to share earlier this month, HP jumped to the #2 spot on America's most [ just ] companies listed.\nOur progress was driven in large part by how we invest in our employees, support our communities and treat our customers. We were recognized as the leader in our industry or all 3. In a few weeks, we will host Amplify, our flagship conference to engage with customers and partners. This event provides an opportunity to share our vision and the progress we have made including how we are delivering AI-powered innovation and technology experience. This past quarter, HP led the way in shaping the future of work, thanks to the dedication of our talented team, and I want to take the opportunity to thank all of them.\nLet me now turn to Personal Systems performance for the quarter. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, with conversion continuing to power the growth more than [indiscernible] a decline in consumer and continued softness in China. We drove share gains in the PC commercial windows market, particularly in high-value categories such as commercial premiums.\nHowever, we lost share in consumer with units down year-over-year. While [indiscernible] is not to gain share for the sake of gaining share you should expect us to improve our performance through the year in this segment, especially in the premium category.\nWorldwide PC commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year, fueled in part by the growing adoption of AI and the positive impact of the Windows 11 refresh cycles. The AI PC market experienced remarkable momentum achieving a sequential growth rate of 25% in calendar quarter 4, and we continued to gain share in this market.\nWe believe the refresh cycle, combined with an increasing mix of AI PCs will further propel our commercial growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Internally, we are empowering our teams with enhanced AI tools. Going forward, all new PCs we purchased will be AI PC, giving our teams greater insights and helping them better address customers' needs.\nIn our growth areas, hybrid systems, advanced compute and AI PCs delivered strong performance with revenue up year-over-year. We believe there is more opportunity here, and we'll continue to prioritize investments in these categories.\nShifting to Print. We saw strong unit growth and share gains in home and specifically big tanks. In office, we maintained our share overall and importantly, gaining share in our strategic areas, A4 value and A3.\nWe continue to see a competitive pricing market in office and weak demand in China that will continue to push us to improve our operational execution. For the Print business, revenue declined 1% in constant currency year-over-year, in line with our expectations. In growth areas, consumer subscriptions revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year.\nThis quarter, we achieved a milestone of 1 million instant paper subscribers with double-digit revenue growth, and we continue to drive revenue growth in industrial graphics.\nIn Workforce Solutions, momentum continued with revenue growth year-over-year. We had [indiscernible] for a new managed print wins during the quarter, including Prime Healthcare. This new customer in a growing industry enables us to support their [indiscernible] journey in 44 hospitals and more than 45,000 employees.\nAnd we saw notable wins in managed device services in multiple verticals, which include automotive, industrial, banking, agriculture and pharmaceuticals in multiple geographies. The range of deals demonstrates our ability to close and manage diverse customer deals around the globe.\nBefore I close, important that I take a moment to share the efforts underway to address the evolving external environment. We have been tracking geopolitical developments and are well prepared to respond to these shifting dynamics. Over the past few years, we have taken proactive measures to ensure manufacturing resiliency.\nWe have built a globally diverse supply chain, and we are continuing to expand our footprint across multiple countries to meet growing customer demand and multi-source production. We have made significant progress. And by the end of fiscal year 2025, we expect more than 90% of HP products sold in North America will be built outside of China. China will continue to be an important manufacturing hub for the rest of the world.\nAs we look ahead, we are managing the current tariff increases on China and have included them in our outlook. Should additional tariffs be implemented we would manage them the same way we have with China, leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network, along with cost improvements and pricing actions as needed. Depending on the scope, while some of our mitigating actions can take a few months lead time, we would be focused on fully offsetting over time.\nDuring the first 2 years of our future ready plan, we have made excellent progress across process efficiency, automation, portfolio optimization and operational excellence. This has given us visibility in traditional opportunities aligned to our future of work strategy. There is more we can do to reduce our structural costs and we now plan to deliver [ $19 ] billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by the end of fiscal year '25. These incremental structural savings to help mitigate macro and geopolitical uncertainty while continuing to support the investments in strategic areas. Karen will share more details about this shortly.\nI will close by reiterating our confidence in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver on our strategy to lead the future of work. As demonstrated in Q1, we have continued to build strong momentum while taking the measures necessary to mitigate risks, navigate policy changes and importantly, invest in our long-term growth. Let me now turn it over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter and the solid progress on delivering towards our financial commitments for the year.\nWe drove revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter with continued strength in the Personal Systems commercial business and momentum in our key growth areas. We also gained share in a stabilizing print market, while executing against our plan to drive strong operating margins. We have made excellent progress in accelerating our future-ready plans. And as Enrique said, have increased the gross annualized run rate savings target for the program by the end of fiscal year '25. And through disciplined execution and rigorous cost management, we delivered on our EPS commitments while maintaining important investments in strategic areas, including the future of work.\nNow taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and 3% in constant currency with growth across all regions. In constant currency, APJ grew 5% and Americas grew 3% and EMEA grew 2%.\nGross margin was 21%, down year-over-year due to increased commodity costs. As mentioned last quarter, we have put in place cost reduction and pricing actions to offset these headwinds. However, they will take time to ramp through the year, leading to stronger margins in the second half.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in key strategic initiatives and our people, offset in part by disciplined cost management, including future-ready cost savings. All in, non-GAAP operating profit was $984 million, in line with our expectations.\nBelow the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was also in line with our expectations and flat year-over-year with lower levels of short-term financing activity offset by higher currency-related losses. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.74.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. We drove solid growth in Personal Systems with revenue up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency from higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs as we continue to take disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate increased component costs.\nWe are focused on leading the future of work and doubling down on commercial which represented over 70% of our PS revenue mix for the quarter. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas across AI PC, advanced compute solutions and hybrid systems.\nAligned with our strategy, we drove commercial revenue up 10% on 6% unit growth with stronger pricing and mix shift towards premium in a market that is beginning to show signs of accelerating refresh activity. However, the consumer market remained competitive, with revenue down 7% on lower volume as a result of our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix.\nOur operating margin in PS was 5.5%, in line with the range we guided at the beginning of the quarter and down year-over-year from higher commodity costs that were not yet fully offset by repricing and cost initiatives. We also continued to invest in important strategic initiatives.\nIn print, our results reflect our focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined execution. While total print revenue was down 2%, we increased our market share with strong performance in consumer hardware. We also drove double-digit revenue growth in [ consumer subscription ] and maintains momentum in industrial. By customer segment, we grew consumer 5% year-over-year on 7% unit growth and drove share gains with double-digit growth in big tank.\nIn commercial, while units were flat year-over-year, revenue declined 7% in a competitive pricing environment, particularly in China, where the market remains weak. We continued our purposeful focus on profitable long-term unit growth, gaining share in the higher-value categories of A4 and A3 and across all markets in the Americas and EMEA.\nWe increased market share and drove favorable pricing and supplies, though revenue declined 1%, with currency and usage headwinds. And we delivered print operating margin at the high end of our range, as expected, reflecting rigorous cost discipline in a competitive market.\nNow turning to our future ready plan. We have continued to drive progress, not only accelerating our initial plan, but also identifying additional initiatives to further reduce costs in our core and drive efficiencies. Given this, we are raising our cumulate gross run rate savings target from $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal year '25.\nWe expect restructuring charges associated with the plan to increase by approximately $150 million to $1.2 billion and anticipate approximately $400 million in charges this fiscal year as we complete the program. These incremental structural savings will be a key lever to help offset macro and geopolitical uncertainties while also continuing to fuel investments in our key growth areas and AI innovation, all designed to position us well for long-term sustainable growth.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. As expected, our cash flow from operations was approximately $375 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $70 million. Our results reflect normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in Personal Systems.\nWith regard to working capital, as part of the tariff response actions, we purposely produced additional inventory and also took advantage of strategic buy opportunities as part of overall cost mitigations. While these actions will be economically beneficial to the year, they increased our cash conversion cycle.\nAnd as we pay for and sell the increased inventory, we anticipate a further impact in cash conversion, resulting in negative free cash flow in Q2. It is important to note that these are timing impacts only and do not impact our full year outlook. Lastly, we returned close to $400 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to monitor the evolving geopolitical environment. And as Enrique mentioned, we have been focused for some time on response plans to mitigate potential adverse impacts. In both our full year and Q2 guide, we have accounted for the added cost driven by the current tariffs on China and associated mitigations, including our higher future-ready cost reductions. I would note that those tariffs mostly impact our Personal Systems business.\nThough the environment ahead remains fluid, we will be focused on offsetting any additional tariffs with further leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network, along with cost and pricing actions as needed.\nWe continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.45 and to $3.75. FY '25 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.86 to $3.16 including increased restructuring costs for our future ready plan.\nAs we said at the beginning of the year, we expect EPS to be stronger in the second half with consistent levels of sequential growth each quarter. Normal seasonal strength in Personal Systems, combined with the timing of the Windows 11 refresh and increased penetration of AI PCs are catalysts that we expect to drive revenue strength in the back half of the year.\nAnd we continue to execute on our offset commodity costs, including repricing efforts and cost reduction actions that are ramping and will have a more significant impact in the second half. These actions and the overall measures we are taking to deliver incremental structural cost savings from our future-ready plans are expected to drive EPS improvement throughout the year, particularly in Q4.\nThere is no change to our beginning of the year projection for print revenue to grow at least in line with the market in fiscal year '25. And we now expect Personal Systems to grow faster than the market, driven by share gains in commercial.\nOur focus on premium categories, including AI PC, is also expected to contribute to increased levels of revenue growth in the second half. We continue to expect PS operating margins to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% range for the year due to the actions I described earlier as well as the sustained efforts to drive higher ASPs through the increased mix of premium products. And for Print, we continue to expect our operating margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range as we exercise disciplined cost management and execute on our future ready plans.\nFor the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. In Personal Systems, we expect Q2 revenue to perform better than typical seasonality as we continue to see strength in commercial aligned with our future work efforts. And we expect Personal Systems margins to remain in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range given the timing of tariff mitigation.\nIn Print, we expect Q2 year-over-year revenue growth to be in line with full year growth rates and operating margins to remain near the top of our 16% to 19% range as we continue to focus profitable unit placement and disciplined cost management.\nAnd just to note, we expect corporate other expense to continue to be higher in Q2, though not as high as Q1 with the timing of some stock compensation expenses. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion for FY '25 with the second half of the year stronger than the first. And on capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x, and there aren't better return opportunities.\nIn closing, we drove solid progress in Q1 against our strategic objectives and full year commitments while taking action that will help us navigate through the dynamic geopolitical environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution as we continue to invest for the future and believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term profitable growth. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Desre, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Brown, who is the Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.\nAs always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings.\nDuring this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me start by welcoming our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who joined HP earlier this month. Her expertise and background are a great addition to our leadership team, and we are delighted to have her on board. Thank you to Tim Brown, for stepping in as Interim CFO over the last 3 quarters.\nToday, I will cover our third quarter results, a few of the new innovative experiences we have introduced, how we are tracking against our strategic priorities and our expectations for Q4. Karen will provide additional details on our financials and outlook.\nStarting with our results, let me first focus on revenue. I am pleased to share we are building solid momentum. The company returned to revenue growth for the first time in 9 quarters, up 2% year-over-year. This was driven by strong performance in Personal Systems and our key growth areas. Commercial PC recovery was strong, in line with our expectations, and a signal of ongoing market stabilization. That said, the recovery of the print market was slower than expected, which impacted print revenue.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was down 7% and non-GAAP EPS was within our previously provided outlook range, but below our expectations. We have been taking decisive actions to address this. We see an immediate opportunity to drive additional structural cost savings in Q4 as part of our future ready program. We're accelerating our plan, raising our exit goal for fiscal year '24. We expect to reach 80% of the 3-year structural cost run rate target by the end of this year.\nWe will also keep executing our plan to strengthen momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. This includes investments in support of our growth businesses. And these combined efforts will help us win in the market, drive profitable growth and build a stronger HP.\nTurning to new innovations, Q3 was another strong quarter. We continue to deliver industry-leading experiences by putting our customers at the center of everything we do. In the AI PC category, we are charging ahead. Our next-gen AI PCs are empowering everyone from knowledge workers to data scientists to unlock the power of AI. In May, we launched our first generation using the latest Qualcomm processor. As the world's thinnest next-gen AI PCs with the longest battery life, they are made for mobility. And in July, we introduced a new premium model powered by the latest AMD processor. It is the most powerful AI PC in the industry with up to 55 types of NPU performance.\nIt delivers personalized experiences like real-time translation, personal communication coaching and quick professional recreation and to help protect against AI-assisted cyber attacks, the new OmniBook Ultra includes the industry-leading protections and capabilities of HP Wolf Security.\nWe are doing even more to raise the bar for data scientists and AI developers. Our HP AI studio, Worlds' most comprehensive workstation solution for AI development. In Q3, we made it even stronger by being the first and only to build GenAI trust into our solution. This means developers can more effectively detect, correct and monitor inaccurate outputs from AI model, making it faster and safer for companies to deploy AI-powered applications.\nIn Workforce Solutions, our proprietary workforce experience platform is exceeding our expectations. Customers are now leveraging our AI capabilities to manage over 250,000 devices and growing. We have recently added several managed devices, wins and deployments including larger companies like Our continued partnership with this global intelligent power management company, will help support the right journey in serving more than 90,000 employees around the world.\nWe set a new standard for industrial printing at drupa, producing advanced digital process and intelligent automation solutions. This included autonomous mobile robots that save up to 2 hours of production a day per press. We also enhanced our print OS platform, giving customers the ability to monitor their entire production floor from jobs mission to delivery. We were honored to take home more best of awards than any other exhibitor at the shelf. We also announced a new partnership with Canva, where 185 million monthly users can now similarly design and create online and print\nWe also secured major deals with print and digital industry leaders like AR Donnelly, all for labels and Cimpress. We are excited about what's ahead. In September, we will host our second annual HP Imaging Here, we will unveil even more new experiences that help our customers drive growth and professional fulfillment. In Q3, we further invested in our long-term success. We acquired Cybercore Technologies, a leading provider of secure supply chain management, cyber solutions for the U.S. federal government. The addition of Cybercore to the HP family will help further strengthen our security expertise and enhanced our offerings.\nAnd just yesterday, we announced we have received $50 million award from the U.S. Department of Commerce. This funding from the Chiefs & Science Act will help modernize and expand our microfluidics semiconductor up in Corvallis, Oregon. It will also help us further expect the potential of our microfluidics technology in new areas such as Life Sciences.\nIn Q3, we released our Annual Sustainable Impact Report, highlighting the important progress we have made. In 2023, our initiatives helped us reach a 27% reduction in value chain greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to roll out easily recyclable packaging created from recycled content. In 2023, we reached a 62% reduction in single-use plastic packaging. And our digital equity efforts have reached 45 million people since 2021.\nWe know there is always more that can be done, but we are proud of our progress. And we are honored to be ranked first in our industry on time magazine's world's most sustainable companies list.\nNow let me share more details on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Personal Systems, revenue was up 5% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Operating profit was 6.4%, in line with expectations. Globally, our PC share was flat year-over-year, but up 1.3 points quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by growth in high-value categories, including workstations and consumer premium.\nWe continue to see strong progress in key growth areas with revenue up year-over-year in Personal Systems Services and in hybrid systems, driven by strong demand for video collaboration. And we grew gaming revenue quarter-over-quarter, in line with normal seasonality. We remain very excited about the AIPC's opportunity. Shipments are ramping and initial reactions overwhelmingly positive. We have a strong portfolio with an unprecedented level of HP Engineering. Our growing ecosystem of developers and AI software providers are a huge competitive advantage.\nForbs declare, HP wants the AIPC crown, and they are right. Our focus is on delivering new AI experiences for our customers. Overall, our AIPC expectations across shipments, higher ASPs and premium mix remains on track with our expectations for the second half.\nShifting to Print, net new was down 3% year-over-year. We delivered print operating profit of 17.3%, which was below our expectations. We saw a softer demand, unfavorable geo mix and a more aggressive pricing environment. Even in this type of challenging environment, I expect us to do better. And as I said earlier, we are taking actions to accelerate our structural cost savings for this year.\nWe have made progress on gaining profitable share with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in home and in office when excluding China. We gained share in our strategic areas especially in big tanks, A3 and A4 value. Key growth areas in print continue to make progress. Consumer services revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year. Industrial graphics did as well, and we have strong momentum coming out of And supplies continue to perform as expected. Overall, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter and return $29 billion to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Our Board of Directors are just increased the total share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This reaffirms our commitment to deliver strong and sustained capital return to our shareholders. Looking forward to Q4, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our markets will continue to be competitive. We expect the PC commercial momentum to continue and our key growth areas to progress. At the same time, the competitive pricing environment will remain in Q4 and the Print market recovery will continue to be slower. As a result, we decided to moderate our expectations for Q4 and the full year.\nWe will maintain investments and progress in high value and key growth areas, and accelerate our cost reduction plans. We are confident in our strategy and well equipped to drive meaningful progress as we round out fiscal year '24. Across our entire portfolio, leveraging AI and enabling hybrid work experiences will remain central to creating solutions that deliver growth and fulfillment for all HPE customers.\nI will pause here and turn it over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Enrique, for the warm welcome. I'm thrilled to join HP, and I'm eager to meet you, our analysts and investors in the months ahead. Though I've been here just a few weeks, I'm incredibly impressed by the innovation all around me. HP is an iconic company, and I'm excited to work with Enrique and our leadership team to create an even stronger future ahead. Building upon our market-leading portfolio, attractive growth businesses, and culture keenly focused on delivering value for our shareholders.\nNow on to the quarter. Starting high level, we are building on the progress we made in the first half. And as Enrique said, are pleased with our return to revenue growth for the first time in 9 quarters. Solid performance in Personal Systems, which grew for the second quarter in a row and in our key growth areas drove our Q3 revenue growth. And double-digit sequential growth in Personal Systems drove strong free cash flow in the quarter. We also returned nearly $870 million to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and remain focused on returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow this fiscal year.\nLooking across the company, the print market was softer than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. And both Print and PS saw a dynamic pricing environment that put some pressure on our margins. As did our focus on continuing to invest for long-term sustainable growth. As a result, and as Enrique mentioned, we are accelerating our future-ready plan and intend to deliver savings sooner than expected.\nAs a reminder, our plan incorporated our goal to deliver gross annualized structural cost savings of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year '25, with approximately 70% or $1.1 billion achieved by the time we exit the fiscal year.\nGiven our focus to mitigate near-term market challenges and just as importantly, maintain investments to drive longer-term growth, we have accelerated our efforts and now expect our cumulative savings target exiting the fiscal year to be approximately $1.3 billion or 80% of the planned target.\nNow let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and up 3% in constant currency. In constant currency, revenue increased in all regions with Americas, EMEA and APJ each growing 3%. Gross margin at 21.5% in the quarter was up slightly year-over-year. Our cost-saving efforts offset both competitive pricing in the face of rising commodity costs and a mix shift given the strong PS performance.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year from continued investment in key initiatives and our people. And of course, we continue to drive cost reductions, including the future-ready cost savings. All in, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was down year-over-year, benefiting from less short-term financing activity and lower interest expense from the debt tender we completed last year. Finally, with a diluted share count of roughly 1 billion shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83, a year-over-year decrease of $0.03, and GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.65.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. Personal Systems revenue was up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency, with higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs, as we worked to adjust pricing where possible to mitigate increased commodity costs.\nTotal units were up 1% year-over-year with strength in commercial. And sequentially, revenue was up 11% and units were up 14% with seasonal strength and overall share gains. Of note, fiber systems revenue grew in the double digits year-over-year, including strong growth in video collaboration.\nDrilling more into the details, Consumer revenue was down 1% with units down 6% and commercial revenue was up 8% on 6% unit growth. Improved pricing in consumer, along with favorable commercial mix and a shift to premium, consistent with our strategy, drove higher overall ASPs. In fact, we continue to see Commercial representing greater than 70% of Personal Systems revenue.\nAnd while calendar Q2 market share was flat year-over-year, we gained share sequentially, driving improvements in high-value categories. And of course, we remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets.\nPersonal Systems operating margin of 6.4% was down slightly year-over-year. We had higher commodity costs and purposely continued our strategic investment, offset in part by future ready savings.\nIn Print, our results reflected the slower pace of market recovery and an incrementally aggressive pricing environment as our Japanese competitors continued to benefit from the weaker yen. Overall, the market came in below expectations, particularly in China. Total print revenue was down 3% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. And while hardware units declined 2% year-over-year, total print market share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. And momentum in industrial graphics continued with supplies and services driving the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.\nBy customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 5% with units down 4%. And as mentioned, we felt the impact of market declines, most notably and competitive pricing. Consumer revenue returned to growth increasing 2% on flat units with favorable mix offsetting pricing. Of note, hardware units grew 5% sequentially, driven by strength in consumer. And supplies revenue was down 2% nominally and 1% in constant currency, in line with our outlook.\nPrint operating margin of 17.3% was down year-over-year, with headwinds from pricing and increased investments, not fully offset by savings from our future-ready actions. On our future-ready transformation plan, we continue to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency across the company. For example, we're using generative AI capabilities to reduce customer call times in Workforce Solutions. And in our commercial organization, our move to more end-to-end processes is enabling much faster deal quotes for contractual customers and allowing customers to more easily buy and renew on hp.com.\nThere is more to come as we accelerate and complete this program, particularly in Print, where we are driving further reductions across the core, including business consolidation, supply chain optimization and reductions in platforms.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated more than $1.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We continue to improve our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving inventory days down with seasonally higher volumes in Personal Systems, offset in part by an increase in strategic buys as we focused on reducing the near-term impact of rising commodity costs.\nLastly, we returned close to $870 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends, and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. Just as a reminder, unless higher ROI opportunities arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remained below 2x, we expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders over time.\nLooking forward to the fourth quarter and our fiscal year-end, we will continue to navigate a dynamic environment. And have, therefore, modeled multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. In Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to increase sequentially low to mid-single digits. We are expecting continued strength in commercial. But given the lingering softness in the consumer market, we are expecting less seasonal growth than we have seen historically.\nWe anticipate Personal Systems operating margin to remain in the upper half of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q4 as we were to offset increased commodity costs through pricing and disciplined cost management, while continuing to invest in strategic priorities.\nIn Print, we see improving trends in the market, but the pace of recovery is slower than we expected with continued competitive pricing pressure. For Q4, we expect Print revenue to increase low to mid-single digits sequentially, driven by typical seasonal strength as well as strong momentum in our industrial business coming out of drupa. We expect supplies revenue in FY '24 to decline low single digits, and we anticipate Q4 Print margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% range, given seasonal strength and acceleration of future-ready cost savings.\nTaking all of these considerations into account, we are moderating our guide for Q4 and fiscal year 2024, and we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.10, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.99. And fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.84. For the full year, we now expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.45, and FY '24 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.72.\nLastly, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY '24. As a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows.\nAt this point, we want to open the lines for your questions. But before we do, I want to express my gratitude to my HP colleagues for their help in making my onboarding as smooth as possible. And in inticular, I want to thank Tim Brown for his leadership in the interim, and his continued help these past few weeks with me. Tim is also on the call with Enrique and me to help answer your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Eric, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Brown, HP's Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is webcast and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.\nWe posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. When we started the fiscal year, we committed to very specific goals, drive profitable growth in our core, accelerating key growth areas and deliver operational efficiency. I am pleased to say we accomplished this and delivered a solid quarter and first half. The focus of our teams and actions we have taken continue to drive results and build momentum. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nWe made good progress against our future ready plan, and we continue to invest in innovative technologies with a strong emphasis on AI and hybrid. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, including the recovery we are starting to see in commercial PCs, progress against our strategic priorities, key innovations we are bringing to market, and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal year 2024.\nThen I will turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. I will start with our results. We continue to navigate well, dynamic and competitive environment. While our net revenue was down 1%, the rate of decline slowed for the fourth third quarter. Personal Systems also returned to growth for the first time in 8 quarters. This is a good indicator of overall market stabilization and solid execution. Non-GAAP operating profit grew 2% and non-GAAP EPS was up year-over-year, which was slightly above the midpoint of our last quarter's guide. In terms of new innovations, Q2 was one of our most significant quarters. At our Amplify Partner Conference in March, we showcased over 100 AI-enabled solutions redefining productivity and collaboration.\nThis event is our largest annual channel conference, attracting over 1,500 of our top partners from 95 countries. It inspired our partners and will help us to drive long-term sustained growth. Let me share some of the key innovations we announced. For the more than 0.5 million data scientists, who are using our workstation solutions to create AI models that improve company workflows, we had a lot to share. We announced the HP AI creation center, the world's most comprehensive workstation solutions for AI development.\nAnd we unveiled a strategic collaboration with NVIDIA to integrate their pretrained models and software into our AI studio set of tools. They will allow customers to access share and edit their data science workflows more easily from anywhere. At the same time, we launched the industry's largest portfolio of AI PC, the first to deliver the benefits of running AI locally on the device for improved performance, efficiency and privacy. In Print, we shared how AI will unlock opportunities to make printing smarter, more efficient and more personalized. And we unveiled our new color laser jet series optimized for small and medium businesses.\nWe also stepped up in our key growth areas. In hybrid systems, we expanded our portfolio of room solutions with a Poly Studio 360-degree camera, enabling more immersive meeting experiences. In Workforce Solutions, we introduced an enhanced workforce experience platform, providing CIOs with an AI-enabled digital experience to unlock the full potential of their teams. In addition, we are enabling our partners and sales teams to capitalize on the AI opportunity. We have introduced the industry's first ever role-based AI master class training and certification program.\nDoubling down on our momentum last week at a Microsoft copilot plus PC event, we introduced the world's most powerful ultra-mobile next-gen AI PCs. Designed from the ground up, they enable on-the-go leaders and freelancers to harness the most powerful AI technologies available. We also showcased our new AI Helix logo that helps you easily identify and select this new category of devices. Initial reaction has been overwhelmingly positive with our next-gen devices being recognized as some of the most premium [ announced ] and having beyond cutting edge hardware. We are already helping customers unlock tangible value from their AI PCs.\nFor example, collaborating with Deloitte Consulting, together, we have created an on-device assistant to drive efficiency around common IT support challenges. The solution has the potential to return close to 100,000 hours of productivity to their practitioners. This is a powerful example of the positive impact of AI PCs. One of HP's most important assets is the strength of our brand, and we continue to invest in it to build even greater value. This quarter, we announced a historic title partnership with Scuderia Ferrari. This is an opportunity to elevate our brand and reach new audiences and geographies, particularly younger and premium customers.\nIt also improves the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing spend. And we are excited to work with Scuderia Ferrari leveraging the latest HP innovations to help them drive their competitive advantage. HP is a trusted brand. We are a company that stands for more than just the products we make. For the fifth year in a row, HP has earned a AAA rating from CDP. Next month, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining the progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals.\nLet me now share in more detail what we saw in each of our businesses in Q2. In Personal Systems, we executed our strategy, driving both revenue growth and increasing profitability year-over-year. The PS revenue was $8.4 billion. That's up 3% year-over-year, driven mainly by market growth and signs of commercial recovery. Our PS operating profit was 6%, in line with our expectations and solidly within our long-term target range. Our teams continue to show their focus by driving profitable PC share in calendar Q1 in high-value categories like commercial premium and mobile workstation.\nImportantly, we continue to invest and grow in high value and key growth areas. In gaming, we grew revenue year-over-year again this quarter. PS services was up with strong growth in managed services. And in hybrid systems, we saw signs of recovery. Here, we drove sequential growth and strong performance in video collaboration. We remain confident that this evolving market will be a long-term growth opportunity. In the second half, we expect to see the introduction of AI PCs, accelerate demand over and above the anticipated PC refresh cycle and Windows 11 rollout.\nWe believe the AI opportunity in front of us will help drive higher ASPs and premium mix. We have a comprehensive portfolio of AI-enabled devices from consumer, commercial, gaming, accessory, room solutions to advance workstation solutions. We're innovating beyond hardware with software and security solutions like HP, AI companion and HP Wolf security that uses deep learning, behavior analysis and AI-based protection against malware and deepfakes. With a rich history and proven track record of integrating meaningful AI technologies such as noise removal and gesture controls, together with our strong innovation pipeline, we are well positioned to capture the opportunity and lead the industry.\nTurning to Print. Results were in line with what we expected. Revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China and some parts of Europe. The pricing environment remains competitive in consumer with intensifying pressure in commercial. We continue to make progress on pricing and share gains in supplies with revenue results as expected. We delivered print operating profit of 19%, in line with our guidance.\nOnce again, we demonstrated disciplined cost management, improved mix and the benefits of the strong innovations we have brought to market. Our focus in Print remains on regaining profitable share, and we are making progress. We grew share quarter-over-quarter in home and in office. Importantly, we gained share year-over-year and sequentially in Big Tanks and Business ink. We also grew in key growth areas like consumer services. We saw growth in revenue and in subscriber numbers across Instant Ink and our new [ all-in plants ].\nIn Industrial Graphics, we continue to accelerate the adoption of digital technologies. In Q2, we grew year-over-year and for the third straight quarter. We also expanded our portfolio adding new end-to-end automation processes, leveraging AI and robotics. These are on full display right now at drupa 2024, the largest trade fair for the printing and graphics industry worldwide. 3D continued to be impacted by elongated purchasing cycles in Q2, reflecting constraints on capital spending. The decline in hardware was partially offset by growth in services and supplies.\nOverall, in Q2, we made good progress against our future-ready strategy. We continue to execute according to plan, and we are on track to deliver on our 3-year annual gross run rate structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and over time. As long as our gross leverage ratio remains below 2x and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q3 and the second half of fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our market will continue to be very competitive.\nThat said, we're encouraged by the progress we have made delivering a solid first half, and we expect a stronger second half. The anticipated commercial PC refresh as well as early gains from the AI PC, together with our plans to gain share in print gives us confidence we are well positioned to drive growth in our core businesses. At the same time, we see significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas. As you have seen repeatedly, we are delivering to expectations and will continue to maintain our focus as we enter the second half. We remain confident in our strategy, and we'll continue to execute on our plan. Let me now turn it over to Tim.\n\nTimothy J. Brown\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q2 driven by disciplined financial management and focused execution while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment. We are pleased with our continued progress we made in Q2 toward delivering on our financial commitments. Total revenue decline slowed further. Our gross profit dollars and margin, our non-GAAP operating profit dollars and margin and our non-GAAP EPS all improved both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.\nIn addition, we generated solid free cash flow, we achieved these results while simultaneously reinvesting in our key growth areas and in AI and managing through a mixed market environment characterized by slightly stronger PS commercial performance balanced against continuing print market demand challenges. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.8 billion in the quarter, down 1%, both nominally and in constant currency. In constant currency, Americas increased 2%. EMEA declined 3% and APJ declined 5%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 23.6% in the quarter, up 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 14.8% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by continued investments and higher variable compensation, partially offset by cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 2%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $158 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.03 or 4% to $0.82, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $205 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments.\nAs a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.61. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.4 billion, up 3% or 2% in constant currency, driven by higher volumes led by commercial partially offset by a decline in ASPs and continued weakness in China. Total units were up 7% with Consumer down 1% and Commercial up 12%. Personal Systems revenue returned to growth exceeding our expectations. We are encouraged by the positive momentum exiting Q2 as we head into the seasonally stronger second half of the year. Drilling into the details, Consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial revenue was up 6%, representing greater than 70% of Personal Systems revenue. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by a favorable mix shift towards commercial and increased consumer pricing, offset largely by an increased mix of lower-end devices. While our market share decline in calendar Q1 as competition intensified, we drove share improvements in high-value categories, including mobile workstations and commercial premium.\nWe remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Last week, we announced the launch of our next-gen AI PC, which is part of a series of launches planned for this year that will expand our portfolio of AI PCs as we enable our customers to deploy advanced AI technology at the edge.\nPersonal Systems delivered $508 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.0%. Our margin increased 0.7 points year-over-year driven by lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, including future-ready savings, offset partially by competitive pricing and investments. In Print, our results reflected our focus on improving execution and diligently managing cost as we continue to navigate a very competitive print market.\nIn Q2, total print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% on a reported basis and down 7% in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in both hardware and supplies. Hardware revenue was down 18% year-over-year, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand, especially in China and EMEA as well as share loss in both home and office due to aggressive pricing partially driven by further depreciation of the yen.\nTotal hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue for the third consecutive quarter driven by supplies and service, offsetting softer hardware demand as we believe our customers delayed purchasing decisions in anticipation of Drupa, which started yesterday. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 17%. Consumer revenue decreased 16%, with units down 17%. In Big Tank, we increased our volumes and market share sequentially, partially offsetting continued market softness and competitive pricing in the traditional home ink market.\nIn Consumer Services, we drove revenue and subscriber growth in both our Instant Ink and All-In Plans. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, down 5% on a reported basis and down 4% in constant currency. This was in line with our outlook. Print operating profit was $829 million, down 8% year-over-year and operating margin was 19%. The Operating margin was flat year-over-year, driven by disciplined cost management, including future-ready savings and favorable mix offset by competitive hardware pricing.\nTurning to our future-ready transformation plan. We are on track to achieve our fiscal year-end '24 goal of delivering a cumulative 70% of our year-end '25 goal of gross annual run rate structural cost savings of $1.6 billion. We expect to achieve this by driving efficiencies in our core businesses. We are pleased with our progress in reducing our cost across print MPS. We continue to see the benefits of initiatives we launched in prior quarters. For example, we continue to optimize our location strategy with plans for additional site actions this year.\nIn our digital transformation initiatives, we're accelerating our generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot to approximately 60% of our developers as well as implementing HP-specific large language models to improve efficiencies across our sales and service organizations. In marketing, we continue to optimize and in-house our digital media capabilities and maximize programmatic investments. Specifically, we are delivering savings through AI-enhanced capabilities, scaling content production, and working towards translation cost efficiencies, helping us improve our NPI marketing efficiency with lower agency costs and next-gen market insights and measurement.\nIn PS, we are simplifying our portfolio. As we announced last week, our brand simplification strategy across our consumer and commercial portfolios. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $581 million and free cash flow was $481 million, driven by net earnings. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This decreased 2 days sequentially due to days inventory increasing 9 days, days payable increasing 16 days and days receivable increasing 5 days.\nThe increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and sea shipments, both of which drive economic value. The strategic buys continue to allow us to take advantage of attractive economic offerings from suppliers to reduce the near-term financial impact of rising commodity costs. The increase in DPO was driven by an increase in accounts payable due to purchase timing and a higher strategic buy inventory. In Q2, we returned approximately $369 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $269 million in cash dividends.\nWe finished the quarter within our target leverage range and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in FY '24 and over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below 2x and less higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to the second half of FY '24, keep the following in mind related to our FY '24 and Q3 financial outlook. As Enrique said, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first half.\nWe continue to model multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '24, we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.30, but we continue to see a range of potential outcomes for H2 '24, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We remain focused on improving our cost structure and our performance while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.6 billion in FY '24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY '24, improving sequentially in both fiscal Q3 and Q4.\nAs a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems, specifically for Q3, we expect Personal Systems revenue will increase sequentially by a high-single digit, though slightly less than typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be towards the high end of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q3 augmented by disciplined cost management actions.\nFor FY '24, we expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC revenue in the back half of the year, continued mix improvements and cost efficiencies. In Print, we expect print to stabilize in the second half of the year, consistent with the market outlook. For Q3, we expect Print revenue to decrease sequentially by low single digit, in line with typical seasonality. We continue to expect supplies revenue in FY '24 to decline by a low to mid-single digit in constant currency.\nFor Q3, we expect print margins to be in the upper half of our 16% and 19% range and now expect FY '24 margins to be at the high end of the range, driven by rigorous cost management. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2024. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.92. And third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.77. We expect FY '24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.60. And FY '24 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Brown, HP's Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me begin by saying it was a solid start to the year. we delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth year-over-year, and our future ready plan is positioning us well to deliver on our long-term growth targets. I'm going to focus my remarks today on our first quarter performance, our progress against key strategic priorities and our expectations for the market for the balance of 2024.\nI will then turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. Starting with our results, we are managing through a volatile external environment that continues to impact demand across our industry. This is reflected in our top line with net revenue down 4% year-over-year.\nIt's worth noting that the rate of revenue decline slowed for the third third quarter, which we see as an encouraging sign of market stabilization. We continue to make progress in our key growth areas. We're maintaining our investments in a down market to strengthen our competitive position and there are several bright spots this quarter. We grew revenue and market share year-over-year in gaming. Orco Solutions delivered solid revenue growth and won several new accounts, including large global companies in the energy retail and telecommunication sectors, and we drove continued momentum in consumer subscriptions with Instant Ink delivering another quarter of revenue and net subscriber growth year-over-year.\nAlongside the progress we are making in our growth areas, we are also driving disciplined execution across the business. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 5% year-over-year, and we delivered 11% non-GAAP EPS growth which was right at the midpoint of our last quarter's guide. This reflects our focus on managing our mix, reducing our costs and maximizing operational efficiencies and we remain well on track to deliver on our 3-year gross annual run rate structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by fiscal year '25.\nQ1 was also a quarter of strong innovation across our portfolio. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we are making on the company-wide AI strategy we shared with you previously. As you will recall, we are focused on creating new product categories, expanding our digital services and solutions and driving internal productivity. We took a big stake forward this quarter at CES, where we launched our first laptops using Intel's new core [ OTA ] processors. This launch help us to win over 100 innovation awards at CES. More importantly, this is just the start of what will be an exciting year for AI PC innovation as we bring new products to market with our silicon and software partners in the coming quarters. Alongside the PC opportunity, we continue to develop new AI applications to run on top of our installed base of more than 200 million commercial devices.\nThe best example of this is the workforce central platform we have discussed with you previously. We have since expanded and renamed the offering which we now refer to as the HP Workforce Experience platform. It integrates data and telemetry from our PC printer and poly devices into a single dashboard to improve productivity, security and collaboration, and it is now available to all of our managed solution customers.\nWe're also shifting more of our offerings to subscriptions in consumer segment. This week, we will be launching our HP all-in subscription plan, which we previewed with you at our Investor Day last October. For a monthly fee, consumers will receive a printer in delivery premium 24/7 support and an option to upgrade their hardware every 2 years. This has tested extremely well in our pilots with customer satisfaction exceeding Instant Ink's already high scores. All of this gives us great momentum heading into our Amplify Partner Conference next week. Amplify is our largest channel event of the year, drawing our top 1,500 commercial resellers from around the world.\nWe will have several of our top silicon and software partners with us to discuss the AIPC opportunity. And we will be launching a range of new innovations across personal systems, print and workforce solutions.\nIn addition to our innovation, I'm really excited about the work we are doing to elevate the HP brand. To lead this work, I am pleased that Antonio Lucio, who joined HP last month as our Chief Marketing and Corporate Affairs Officer. Antonio was our first CMO following the creation of HP Inc. in 2015. Under his leadership, we strengthened our reputation as one of the world's most trusted brands. And you will see us launching new brand campaigns that are globally scalable and locally relevant.\nFor example, earlier this month, we announced a multiyear deal with Real Madrid football club with millions of funds and more than 0.5 billion followers on social media, Real Madrid is one of the most loved brands. And as the club's newest technology partner, who will be collaborating to create new fun experiences. We also recently announced a global collaboration with Riot Games, one of the world's top game developers, and we will be working with them to develop future gaming products, technical innovation and co-branded marketing campaigns. Underpinning all of this, we are continuing to advance our sustainable impact strategy, which continues to drive innovation and help us to win new deals. I was proud to see HP ranked #13 on this year's list, of America's most just companies from Just Capital and CNBC. This was our fifth straight year on the list and our highest ever ranking, up 34 spots year-over-year and putting us in the top 2% of companies measured.\nLet me now provide some additional color on our business unit performance. The external environment remains dynamic. In Consumer, we anticipate that a post holiday slowdown, and this was a bit more pronounced than initially expected. Commercial customers remain cautious. While we saw signs of stabilization in the SMB and education markets, we saw a slowdown in U.S. enterprise and federal sales especially in the month of January. We also continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions, partially offset by strength in India.\nPersonal Systems net revenue was $8.8 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency, reflecting market dynamics and seasonality. Consistent with the industry estimate, we continue to expect the PC market to grow low single digits in 2024 and we expect to grow at least in line with the market. Our PS team continued to show resilience and operational rigor, delivering operating profit of 6.1%, which was solidly within our long-term target range, so slightly below our expectations. Importantly, we once again gained PC share in calendar Q4, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. This shows that HP innovation is winning in the market, and we are winning in the right areas with a focus on high-value segments such as premium work stations and gaming. Peers services revenue was up year-over-year with strong growth in digital services. And while hybrid systems remains impacted by the current enterprise spending environment, we are investing in the portfolio for deferential market recovery and long-term growth opportunity.\nTurning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion. That's down 5% year-over-year, reflecting market headwinds. China softness and the aggressive pricing environment. And I am pleased with the progress we are making on pricing and share gains in supply. We continue to effectively manage our costs and mix between consumer and commercial, with operating profit of 19.9%. We're also making progress on our efforts to regain profitable share. We gained share in big tanks, both year-over-year and sequentially and we drove sequential share gains in office in parts of Europe, India and China.\nWe're also pleased with our progress in industrial graphics and 3D both of which grew revenue year-over-year in Q1. We also saw continued recovery in labels and packaging, and we are ramping up for Drupa in May. Held every 4 years, this is the world's largest printing event, where we will launch a range of new innovations to accelerate our momentum in the market.\nConsistent with the capital allocation strategy we have shared with you previously, we resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we plan to remain active in the market for the remainder of the year.\nLet me now close by providing some insight into how we see the market for the balance of the year. Despite pockets of softness in Q1, we saw signs of improvement overall. While we expect the pace of recovery to be uneven across different segments, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow targets. And as we said before, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal year '24 to be seasonally stronger than the first half. By remaining focused on things we can control and investing in our future, we have proven our ability to navigate current market dynamics while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. This is exactly what we did in Q1.\nAnd it what you can expect from us moving forward as we drive progress against our future trade plan. I now want to introduce Tim Brown. As you know, he took over as our interim CFO in January. For those of you that don't know, TIM is one of HP's most successful and respected financial executives. He has over 30 years of HP experience, including as CFO of Print and Personal Systems and he is a steady hand on the wheel while we complete our CFO search process. Tim, thank you for your leadership, over to you.\n\nTimothy J. Brown\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Enrique, for the kind introduction. It's great to be with you all today.\nWe are pleased with the progress we made during Q1 toward delivering on our financial commitments this year. On a year-on-year basis, our revenue declines continued to slow sequentially, consistent with the stabilizing trends we expected heading into the year. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew margins expanded in both Personal Systems and Print and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits. We remain on track with our future-ready plan to achieve our gross annual run rate structural cost savings target for this year and continue to reinvest these savings in our growth areas. We also returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we actively repurchased shares during the quarter.\nTop line results were impacted by lower market TAMs in both Personal Systems and Print. We saw cautious commercial demand as macro challenges persisted and a bit more pronounced slowdown than initially expected in consumer following Q4. As Enrique said, HP remains focused on executing each quarter while also driving long-term shareholder value. Our overall results reflect disciplined financial management and investment for sustainable profitable growth all while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment in the near term.\nWe will continue to manage our business prudently while seizing opportunities to improve our market position as we continue to execute on our plan to deliver our fiscal year commitments.\nNow let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency, driven by declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 7%, EMEA declined 2%, and APJ declined 7%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 21.9% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year primarily due to improved commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by competitive pricing. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 13.5% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses were driven primarily by investments in growth initiatives and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation and structural cost reductions.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $144 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.08 or 11% to $0.81 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $186 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.62.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $8.8 billion, down 4% or 5% in constant currency, driven by soft demand and an unfavorable mix shift partially offset by market share gains in both consumer and commercial, including categories such as premium notebooks and workstations. Total units were up 5% with consumer up 10% and commercial up 2%.\nYear-over-year growth rates for units and revenue improved sequentially in both consumer and commercial as stabilizing trends continued, consistent with our outlook for a PC market recovery this year. Drilling into the details, commercial revenue was down 5% and consumer down 1%. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by a favorable mix, including improved commercial premium mix offset primarily by an unfavorable mix shift in consumer. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets.\nPersonal Systems delivered $537 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.1%. Our margin increased 0.9 points year-over-year primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings. This was partially offset by pricing and investments in growth areas. Sequentially, our operating margin declined primarily due to higher commodity costs and marketing expenses, offset in part by favorable mix towards our commercial business segment.\nIn Print, we remain focused on improving our execution and driving rigorous cost management as we navigate a challenging and competitive print market. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5%, both nominally and in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in hardware. Hardware revenue was down 19%, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand in China and Greater Asia and share loss largely due to aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. Total hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue again this quarter, driven by hardware, supplies and services. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 18%. Consumer revenue decreased 22% with units down 15%.\nThe market for big tank printers continue to increase sequentially, partially offsetting continued soft demand and aggressive pricing in the traditional home ink market. In Consumer Services, Instant Ink revenue and subscribers continued to grow year-over-year. Total subscribers now exceed 13 million, including more than 700,000 subscribers to our Instant paper add-on service. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency primarily driven by favorable pricing actions, share gains and an easy compare, partially offset by a lower installed base. Print operating profit was $872 million, essentially flat year-over-year and operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 1 point driven by lower hardware volumes, cost improvements, including lower variable compensation and supplies pricing, partially offset by hardware pricing headwinds. Regarding our structural cost saving initiatives, we continued the momentum we had exiting FY '23, making progress in Q1 against our year 2 goals of our 3-year plan. We are on track to deliver on our $1.6 billion gross annual run rate structural cost savings goal exiting 2025, including achieving approximately 30% of those savings in FY '24. Recall that we expect to generate these savings across both our cost of sales and OpEx line items, enhancing our margin performance and enabling investments in our key growth areas. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to benefit from portfolio simplification initiatives in both Personal Systems and Print, digital transformation, automation and process improvements, leveraging our AI capabilities and structural cost reductions across our business.\nWe still expect to incur onetime restructuring cost of approximately $1 billion over the term of our plan, including approximately $0.3 billion of primarily cash charges in the fiscal year '24.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $120 million and free cash flow was $25 million. Our results were impacted by normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in Personal Systems. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter. This increased 3 days sequentially due to days of inventory increasing 4 days, days payable decreasing 1 day and days receivable decreasing 2 days. The increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and [ C shipments ] during the quarter partially offset by our progress on optimizing our operational inventory, as we have discussed in the past.\nIn Q1, we returned approximately $775 million to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases and $275 million in cash dividends. We continue to prudently manage our leverage ratio and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. We resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we expect to return 100% of our FY '24 free cash flow to shareholders. As we have previously stated, we are committed to returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time. As long as our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 2x, and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY '24, we expect the macro and demand environments will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will continue to be very competitive. We remain focused on rigorously managing costs, improving our performance and investing in growth. Specifically, keep the following in mind related to our FY '24 and Q2 financial outlook.\nGiven the challenging macro environment, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '24, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we expect the performance in the second half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first half.\nRegarding OI&E expense, we continue to expect it to be approximately $0.7 billion in FY '24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion in FY '24 with the second half of the year stronger than the first. Our free cash flow outlook does include approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows.\nTurning to Personal Systems. We continue to expect the overall PC market unit TAM to recover over the course of this year, increasing by a low single-digit percent. Specifically for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will decline sequentially by a high single digit, in line with typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range in Q2 as the PC market continues to recover and has strong cost management and pricing actions helped to offset rising commodity costs.\nFor FY '24, we expect margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC market demand, a seasonally stronger second half of the year, continued mix improvements partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, we expect consumer demand will remain soft and pricing competitive, while market uncertainty continues to impact our commercial print business. Disciplined cost and mix management should help to partially offset these trends, driving flattish revenues sequentially in [indiscernible] below typical seasonality. We expect Q2 supplies revenue to be down mid-single digit in constant currency, and we still expect Supplies revenue will decline low to mid-single digits for the year. Quarterly results can vary. For Q2, we expect print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 19% range and solidly within the range for FY '24. We continue to focus on driving print operating profit dollars through new business models and rigorous cost management, including future-ready transformation savings.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2024. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.68. We expect FY '24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 and FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.61 and $3.01.\nIn closing, we started off our new fiscal year making solid progress against our strategic objectives and full year commitments while managing through demand and competitive challenges that have persisted in the current dynamic environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution and cost management and are confident that we have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy to deliver for both our customers and our shareholders for the long term. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. And welcome to HP's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining our final earnings call of 2023. It was great to host many of you for our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. As I said at the time, we have made significant progress against our strategic priorities, and we see attractive opportunities ahead.\nOur Future Ready Plan, combined with our relentless focus on the things we can control, enable us to make steady progress against our plan in fiscal year '23. We are very pleased with our Q4 results, and we have finished the year in a much stronger position than we began. We knew from the start that it would be a tough year. A challenging external environment constrained demand across the industry, and this is reflected in our full year results. Net revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% year-over-year. And non-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14%. We executed well in the face of these market dynamics, growing non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially throughout the year.\nAnd our second half results were significantly stronger than the first. We also made good progress in our key growth areas, which grew mid-single digits and drove approximately 20% of our total company revenue for the year. Our plan is designed to grow these businesses to at least $15 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '26. And we over-delivered on our gross annualized structural cost savings plan, putting us well on track to achieve our recently increased 3-year target of $1.6 billion.\nOur results reinforce our confidence in the financial outlook we shared with you in October. And I want to say a big thank you to our entire HP team for paving the way toward our next phase of growth. I am going to use my time today to summarize our Q4 performance, provide insight into each of our segments and reiterate some of the thoughts I shared last month about the market in 2024. Let me start with Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion. That was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected market dynamics we discussed last quarter. Revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting our progress.\nI want to mention our key growth areas. Collectively, they grew 10% sequentially or 2x faster than our total company growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, up 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was strong at $1.9 billion, enabling us to meet our full year target of approximately $3 billion. I'm particularly pleased with the strength of our innovation. This was on display at our HP imaging event last month, where we gathered media and industry analysts from around the globe to showcase more than 20 new products and services.\nThis included the expected fall a device that reflects HP's culture of innovation at its best. Seamlessly transforming from laptop to tablet to desktop. It has widespread recognition as one of the most innovative form factors the industry has seen. And it recently received a red design award, one of the highest owners in industrial design. We also continue to build momentum in AI.\nWe are the first company to offer a dedicated workstation solutions with NVIDIA's AI enterprise software. And more broadly, we're advancing our work to create the IPC category. We have built the widest range of client products based on Intel's next generation of processors, Intel core alter, giving us a strong foundation on which to build as we co-engineer and commercialize new AI architectures next year. And I am very encouraged by the work underway with all of our silicon and software partners. The emergence of the IPC in 2024 will start a new cycle of market expansion and refresh. As I shared last month, we believe this can double the overall PC category growth rate over the next 3 years.\nIn Print, we have refreshed our entire A3 and A4 portfolio, making devices smaller, more modular and easier to manage and secure. We also continue to leverage our IP to create new categories. This includes our site print construction solution, which has already laid out more than 1 million square feet at construction sites in North America and the U.K. and is launching in new geographies.\nWe expanded our poly solutions for large conference rooms and small hidden spaces. We also launched a new conference room as a Service subscription to help customers optimize usage and create better employee experiences. And we launched HP workforce Center, which integrates data for more than 60 service tools across PCs, printers and poly devices into a single platform. This will drive simplicity, productivity and security for IT departments. We're in beta with over 2,000 customers and will be rolling it out to all managed solution accounts. As we innovate across our portfolio, we remain equally focused on our sustainable impact priorities.\nA great example is our recently announced HP free new solutions. By enhancing our refurbishment capabilities, we are now able to extend the life of devices and drive secularity at scale. In addition to supporting our sustainability goals, this reduces total cost of ownership and creates an accretive business. We have launched in India and will be expanding to other markets during fiscal year '24.\nWe're also playing an active role to support our communities. Right now, we are particularly focused on the needs of those an Israel and gas. Since the attacks of October 7, our #1 priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees in the region. I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work our team is doing to keep our business in usual fully operational in the phase of an extremely difficult situation.\nHP Foundation has committed $1 million to human Italian release partners in the region. We will continue doing everything we can to support our local teams. Let me now turn to our business unit performance. external environment remains consistent with what we discussed at our at our Securities Analyst Meeting.\nOur baseline scenario of market stabilization across fiscal year '24 has not changed, and our markets largely behaved, as we expected in Q4. Consumer showed a more typical seasonal uptick. Commercial customers remain cautious, but we saw some signs of stabilization, especially in Personal Systems. And we continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions.\nPersonal Systems net revenue was $9.4 billion in the quarter, that's down 8% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. But what's most important is we continue to drive significant sequential improvement in the business, with PS revenue up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our disciplined execution delivered strong peers operating margin of 6.7%. We once again gained share in Commercial and Consumer year-over-year.\nWe saw a continued recovery in Consumer and Gaming, both of which grew double digits sequentially. And through our stepped-up focus on Workforce Solutions, we grew our peer service TCV double digits, including new wins with several large global customers spanning multiple industries. Hybrid systems grew sequentially, largely driven by seasonality in consumer peripherals.\nThis market is currently impacted by enterprise spending, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity and the breadth of our offering across hardware peripherals and services is a huge advantage.\nTurning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion. That's down 3% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. Print revenue grew 4% sequentially. While units were flat. Supplies revenue was up in constant currency in Q4 on an easier compare and finished the year down 1% in constant currency, in line with our long-term outlook.\nWe drove strong print operating margins of 18.9%, reflecting disciplined execution and cost management. HP Plus enabled and big tank printers, once again comprise approximately 60% of our shipments. In standing delivered another quarter of revenue and subscriber growth year-over-year, and we drove strong momentum in Workforce Solutions with double-digit TCV growth and significant new NPS wins.\nWe remain focused on regaining profitable print share and improving our performance in office, and we are starting to see the impact of our efforts, with solid share recovery in Americas, parts of Europe and China quarter-over-quarter. As well as strong share gains in A3. Our industrial graphics business returned to growth year-over-year and was up double digits sequentially, including continued recovery in labels and packaging.\nAnd while 3D is impacted by the current environment, we continue to build momentum in the market. At FormNext earlier this month, we showcased our work with partners and customers like BMW, Decathlon and Siemens, to scale our 3D solution.\nOverall, Q4 was a solid quarter. We are showing the resilience, agility and operational rigor, needed to win in the market, while advancing our long-term growth priorities. And we feel good about the outlook we shared with you in October. We also remain committed to returning at least 100% of free cash flow, over time. Unless opportunities with a higher return on investment arise, and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. We expect to resume share repurchases in Q1.\nLet me close by reiterating something I said at our Securities Analyst Meeting. HP is a compelling investment. We have market-leading portfolios in the PC and print categories, and we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in our core markets going forward. We have significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas.\nWe have world-class operational capabilities, to deliver on our targets and reduce our structural costs. And we have a shareholder-friendly capital return strategy. These are core strengths of HP. Our Q4 and fiscal year '23 results reflect the consistent progress we are making. And we are confident in our plan to deliver sustained revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow growth. Let me now turn the call over to Marie for a deeper dive into the numbers.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThanks, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. We delivered another strong quarter financially, due to outstanding operational execution and good progress in our future ready transformation.\nWe generated solid results across revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, building on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding our goals. Our team is executing well despite the challenging macro environment, delivering Q4 sequential growth in revenue and non-GAAP operating profit dollars in both Personal Systems and Print.\nMargins were at or above the high end of our ranges, resulting in a return to year-over-year growth in non-GAAP EPS. While free cash flow more than doubled sequentially, consistent with our outlook. We exceeded our future-ready transformation cost savings target for fiscal '23 and are on track in '24, to continue reducing our structural costs, while investing in our key growth areas.\nWhile we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business. We will continue our efforts to drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term, while prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses. With the savings we generate, we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, so that we are well positioned to deliver on the longer-term financial outlook, we outlined at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month.\nNow let me begin by providing some additional color on our results. Starting with the full year, we stayed focused on what we could control, disciplined execution and cost management, and we delivered solid performance despite the macroeconomic and competitive dynamics we faced. Revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% nominally and down 12% in constant currency. Revenue in our key growth areas grew mid-single digits, constituting approximately 20% of total revenue.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14% or 8.5% of total revenue, flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP net earnings per share was down 18% to $3.28. We generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow consistent with our full year guidance. And we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and raised our dividend by 5%.\nNow, let's take a closer look at the details of Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 6% normally and 5% in constant currency. Year-over-year declines improved sequentially across each of our regions in constant currency, Americas declined 6%, EMEA declined 2%, and APJ declined 8%, as demand remained soft in China. Gross margin was 21.6% in the quarter, up 3.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs and a favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing in Personal Systems.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion, the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by reinvestment of some future-ready savings in growth initiatives, investment in people and 1 extra month of Poly, offset in part by structural and other cost reductions.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 11.5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $173 million, up sequentially due largely to higher currency losses and up year-on-year due to higher currency losses and factor costs. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, increased $0.08 or 10% to $0.90, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $72 million, primarily related to tax adjustment related credits and pension and post-retirement benefit, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.97.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $9.4 billion, down 8% or 7% in constant currency, but up 5% sequentially, reflecting seasonal strength ahead of the holiday season. Total units were flat on a net basis with Commercial down 6% and a Consumer up 9%.\nNevertheless, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q3, on a year-over-year basis for the third consecutive quarter. And year-over-year Commercial revenue declines stabilized sequentially even as Commercial customers remain cautious.\nDrilling into the details, Consumer revenue was down 1% and Commercial was down 11%, driven by lower TAM, increased competitive pricing and unfavorable mix, offset in part by market share gains in both Consumer and Commercial. Strong profit and margin results in both customer segments were driven by our emphasis on profitable growth and effective cost management.\nCompetitive pricing pressures eased somewhat in Q4, resulting in increased ASPs, contributing to the sequential improvement in Personal Systems revenue this quarter, consistent with our outlook. Our channel inventory is back to normalized levels.\nPersonal Systems delivered $631 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.7%. Our margin increased 2.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and structural cost savings. This was partially offset by mix, currency and investment in people. Sequentially, our operating margin held firm towards the high end of our target range, driven by strong profitability in both our Consumer and Commercial business segments.\nIn Print, our results reflect our continued focus on execution and disciplined cost management, as we navigate a weak and competitive Print market. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 3% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share loss and currency. Offset partially by supplies revenue growth.\nHardware revenue was down $188 million, driven by lower volumes attributable largely to continued soft demand in Greater Asia and China and share loss as our Japanese competitors continued to price aggressively. Total hardware units decreased 19% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics finished the year positively with revenue returned to growth in Q4, driven by hardware and services with performance improvements across all major geographical regions.\nBy Customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 4% on a reported basis and in constant currency with units down 24%. And Consumer revenue decreased 21% or down 19% in constant currency with units down 18%. Demand for traditional home ink printers remain soft but was offset partially by increased demand for big tank printers.\nIn office hardware, ASPs were up double-digit year-over-year as favorable mix, offset competitive pricing and currency headwinds driven by improved contractual A3 demand across multiple markets. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, increasing 3% nominally and 4% in constant currency.\nFor FY '23, supplies revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis in line with our long-term outlook of down low to mid-single digits. Print operating profit was approximately $836 million, down 6% year-over-year, and our operating margin was 18.9%, Operating margin decreased 0.8 points driven by investments in people, competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by favorable mix and cost reductions.\nTurning to our Future Ready Transformation plan. We successfully completed the first year of our 3-year program and delivered better-than-expected performance, against our goals for fiscal year '23. Given the strong progress, we made during the year and confidence we have to drive additional structural cost savings, we recently raised our cumulative program target to $1.6 billion.\nIn FY '23, we generated gross annual run rate structural cost savings across COGS and OpEx, exceeding our revised target. Let me briefly recap some key accomplishments across each of the 3 core pillars of our program that we achieved during fiscal '23. Under our operational excellence pillar, we continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our businesses, particularly in corporate.\nWe embraced hybrid work, enabling us to rationalize our real estate portfolio, executing 13 site consolidations or exits during the year. We also simplified our go-to-market organization, including streamlining our management structure. We made solid progress on our digital transformation efforts by driving additional automation and process improvements. We modernized our data infrastructure to leverage AI machine learning to deliver richer, data-driven insights from business decisions.\nLooking ahead, we are accelerating a generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools like GitHub Copal to approximately half of our developers as well as implementing HP-specific large language models to improve efficiencies through a chatbot for our sales and service representatives.\nFurther, there are significant opportunities ahead, across many additional use cases. Our third pillar is focused on simplifying our product portfolio. Significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. In FY '23, the actions we took in Personal Systems continued to impact our overall performance.\nAt the end of FY '23, we were approximately halfway to our year-end FY '24 goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately 1/3. In addition, we made great progress reducing our commodity complexity by decreasing the number of client SKUs at our Personal Systems portfolio. We expect these initiatives will optimize our overall supplier ecosystem increase our supply chain efficiency and drive better forecast capabilities.\nAnd in Print, by rationalizing our investments, we plan to simplify our Print portfolio to drive a 40% reduction in ink hardware platforms shipped by FY '25. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting, we see significant opportunities ahead of us to focus on our Future Ready Plan and position the company to optimize our cost structure and enhance our margin performance.\nShifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was strong at $2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.9 billion, on the strength of the sequential growth in Personal Systems. Free cash flow for fiscal year '23 was approximately $3.1 billion, consistent with our outlook. The cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days in the quarter. This improved 3 days year-over-year, driven exclusively by an increase in days payable.\nIn Q4, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, given that we were in possession of material nonpublic information, but we expect to resume repurchases in Q1 and and be active throughout FY '24. For fiscal year '23, we returned greater than $1.1 billion to shareholders and retired $1.6 billion of debt.\nRegarding FY '24, we are reiterating our outlook provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. We intend to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, next year, as long as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains under 2x and unless higher ROI opportunities arise, such as strategic acquisitions.\nLooking forward to FY '24, consistent with what we said at our October Securities Analyst Meeting, we assume the market will stabilize in our base case scenario, underlying that outlook for Personal Systems is for revenues to grow in line with the Personal Systems market and for Print revenue to be in line with the Print market. We expect operating margins for both Personal Systems and Print to be solidly within their respective target ranges, as we continue to manage costs and pricing in this dynamic and uncertain environment.\nRegarding our non-GAAP FY '24 EPS outlook, consistent with historical seasonality, we expect second half performance will be greater than the first half. As we said at our Security Analyst Meeting, we expect corporate other expense for fiscal '24, to be relatively flat year-over-year at approximately $1 billion.\nKeep in mind that due to the timing of compensation expense, we expect approximately 1/3 of FY '24's corporate other expense in Q1. And in Q1, we expect the economic and demand environment to remain challenging but stable. As we continue to manage cost aggressively to help offset some of these pressures, we expect our operating profit margins for both Personal System and Print to be toward the high end of their respective target ranges for the quarter.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q1 and fiscal year 2024. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. And first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. We expect FY '24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65. And FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.08.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our Q4 results, as we delivered on our commitments, even in light of the continued challenging macro environment. Our longer-term financial framework that we outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting last month, remains unchanged, and we have good momentum to execute on our near-term FY '24 objectives.\nOur focus remains on profitable growth in the higher value segments of the market and structural cost savings across our P&L, while returning 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. When we spoke last quarter, we said that our second half performance would be stronger than the first half. We outlined a clear plan to drive sequential improvement and this is exactly what we delivered in Q3. We grew net revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow quarter-over-quarter in a tough market environment. And our Future Ready plan is enabling continued progress against our long-term growth priorities while driving structural cost savings.\nToday, I'm going to spend a few minutes recapping Q3. I will then talk about the market dynamics we see in each of our business units. And I will close by sharing my thoughts on the external environment heading into Q4 before handing the call to Marie. Starting with our results, net revenue was $13.2 billion. That's down 10% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Even so, third quarter net revenue was up 2% sequentially despite macro headwinds continuing to impact demand across the industry.\nWe also made good progress in our key growth areas. While these businesses are not immune to end market challenges, collectively, they delivered solid sequential growth in the quarter. This reflects the power of the portfolio we are building to meet a wider range of customer needs. And we are continuing to invest in these areas to strengthen our position and accelerate our momentum. We remain on track to deliver at least 40% of our 3-year structural cost savings target by the end of this fiscal year. And I want to thank all of our teams for driving disciplined execution and cost management across the business. Because of their work, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.86. This is at the midpoint of our previously provided guidance and was up 9% sequentially.\nAs we reduce our structural cost, it's enabling sustained investment and innovation aligned with our long-term growth priorities. At SIGGRAPH, we launched our new Z4 Rack workstation for data scientists, content creators and engineers. With the option of our HP Anyware remote computing software, users can access the high performance power of the Z4 from any device. At Computex, we introduced our next-gen Hyper X Cloud III gaming headsets, which creates immersive audio experiences for gamers. We unveiled our new Poly Studio video solution for hybrid meeting rooms. on AI-driven software that automatically detects and frames participants to enable a better experience between people in the room and colleagues connecting remotely. And we launched HP SitePrint, an innovative robotic solution that empowers workers to print the most complex construction site layout with pinpoint accuracy while achieving 10x productivity.\nI am even more excited about the progress we are making with our silicon and software partners to co-engineer new platforms that run generative AI at the edge. As I mentioned last quarter, this is a massive opportunity for PC reinvention. Being able to run AI applications locally enables lower latency as well as more robust security and privacy protection. I am very pleased with pipeline of innovation our teams are building, and we view this as a significant driver of PC refresh in 2024 and beyond. We will be unveiling a wide range of new products and services at our first-ever HP Imagine event on October 5. This is a moment for us to showcase innovation across our portfolio, and I invite you all towards the live stream.\nLast quarter, we also released for annual Sustainable Impact Report. It outlines the progress we have made against our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. We have now reduced our absolute carbon footprint by 18% since 2019. And we achieved our goal to enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people 3 years ahead of plan. I hope many of you were able to watch our webcast on these topics earlier this month. This work has a positive impact on our communities and helps us to win business.\nLet me now turn to our business unit performance. Starting at the macro level, we continue to navigate an uneven environment, including FX headwinds. From a customer segment perspective, the picture is somewhat mixed. We are seeing enterprise spending remain cautious, with a rising cost of capital being a notable factor. The SMB segment is showing resilience. And in consumer, we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. Geographically, we see various dynamics playing out in different parts of the world. Most markets are experiencing some weakness, although at different levels. For example, we saw a downturn in the China market, where demand is not even yet back in the lower GDP recovery.\nPersonal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion in the quarter. That's down 11% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Even so, we saw a significant improvement this quarter with PS revenue up 9% sequentially. This reflects back-to-school demand as well as higher unit volume resulting in share gains. Our PS operating margin was strong at 6.6%. Operating profit dollars grew sequentially, driven by higher volume, our disciplined cost management and structural cost reduction. We also gained share in both Commercial and Consumer while still focusing on profitable share. Year-over-year, we gained 2.9 share points while retaining our #1 position in Commercial.\nGaming saw a significant recovery with double-digit sequential growth. And PS services TCV grew strong double digits sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to Print, revenue was $4.3 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China as well as aggressive pricing in the consumer print market and delayed enterprise spending in the industrial space. Supplies revenue was broadly flat year-over-year in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We delivered Print operating margin of 18.6%. This reflects our disciplined cost management as well the work we are doing to rebalance overall system profitability.\nFor example, this quarter, about 60% of our shaped units where HP+-enabled or profit upfront big tank printers. And Instant Ink once again grew revenue and new enrollees year-over-year. We also see opportunities to improve our Print performance. We are specifically focused on regaining profitable share and improving our performance in office through stepped-up execution. And given the competitive environment in home printing, we need to improve our cost structure to maintain long-term profitability.\nTurning to our industrial business. The graphics and 3D markets continue to be impacted by macro environment and delayed ordering cycles. That said, they remain important parts of our plan to drive long-term growth and value creation, and we continue to innovate to strengthen our position. I also want to acknowledge the continued progress we are making in our workforce services and solutions business. We delivered solid growth in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. And we are building a strong funnel as we spend time introducing our newly integrated portfolio of services with customers. We are very encouraged by the opportunities to grow this business moving forward.\nOverall, Q3 was a solid quarter, given current market conditions. Our Future Ready plan is on track. We're investing in innovation and making good progress against our long-term growth priorities, and we are doubling down on execution across every facet of our business. This is important as we expect the market to remain challenging in Q4. The macro situation is not improving as quickly as anticipated. And while we expect to deliver another quarter of sequential growth, we are moderating our expectations for Q4 and the full year, consistent with the revised market outlook.\nThis outlook is largely driven by the continued aggressive pricing environment in PCs, sluggish demand in China and enterprise demand softness. Notwithstanding the actions we are taking to mitigate these headwinds, we believe it's prudent to lower our outlook based on near-term market reality. Let me be clear, we will use this moment as an opportunity to double down on the things we can control. We have already begun identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our cost structure where we believe we can overdeliver on our cost saving target.\nThis is certainly not the first time we have had to adapt market volatility. It's something we have been doing consistently over the past few years. We know how to manage the business to this situation. And we have a strong track record, taking actions that protect our profitability and free cash flow, which is what you can continue to expect from us. And while we clearly have some additional work to do in the near term, we remain confident in our long-term trajectory.\nWe have consistently said that progress won't always be linear, but we are focused on what we can control and driving disciplined execution to unlock value. We will also continue to execute the capital allocation strategy we have shared previously. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in Palo Alto in October for our Securities Analyst Meeting. As many of you know, this was an event we hosted each fall prior to 2020. We hosted it virtually in 2021 and it will be great to be back together in person.\nWe will use the meeting to share more detail on the progress we are making against our Future Ready plan, including some of the opportunities we see to accelerate our digital transformation and structural cost reduction. We will also highlight exciting innovation across the HP portfolio. And we will talk a lot about the significant long-term opportunities we see to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. With that, let me stop here and turn the call over to Marie to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered positive results in Q3 and continued to build on the progress we made during the first half of the year despite the challenging macro environment. We have increased our non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially over the course of the year in line with our outlook. In Q3, our Personal Systems business drove high single-digit sequential revenue growth, which in turn helped drive strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. We successfully completed a debt tender exceeding $1.1 billion late in the quarter that reduced our gross leverage ratio as planned.\nAnd our Future Ready transformation plan is on track to achieve at least $560 million in gross annual run rate structural cost savings this year. While there are pockets of our business where we are working to improve our execution, we made good progress during the quarter.\nNow let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 10% nominally and 7% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 8%, EMEA declined 5% and APJ declined 9%, driven by weakened demand in China. Gross margin was 21.4% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs in Personal Systems and favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing across both of our businesses.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion or 12.6% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the Poly acquisition and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready structural cost savings. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, down 15.1%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $143 million, down sequentially due to lower short-term financing activity and up year-on-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.17 or 17% to $0.86 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $93 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments, offset partially by the debt extinguishment benefit and nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.76.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion, down 11% or 8% in constant currency. Total units were up 3%. Sequentially, revenue was up 9% and total units were up 21% with Commercial up 17% and Consumer up 28%. Improved sequential demand was driven by seasonal strength with back-to-school demand. We also saw continued commercial enterprise softness driven by cautious spending and delayed purchase decisions. We improved our overall market share in calendar Q2 on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by gains in both Commercial and Consumer markets. We continued to see Commercial representing approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter.\nOur strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Our channel inventory levels are normalizing. However, our estimate is that the industry-wide channel inventory continues to remain elevated. As a consequence, ASP pressures offset volume growth accounting for year-over-year revenue decline in Personal Systems in the quarter.\nDrilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 12% and Commercial was down 11%. Increased competitive and promotional pricing drove ASPs lower, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue and higher unit volumes resulting in share gains. We increased our market share and higher-value premium categories, including Commercial Windows and Gaming. Personal Systems delivered almost $600 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.6%. Our margin declined 0.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased pricing competition, mix, currency and higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs, structural cost savings and logistics expense.\nIn Print, our results reflect our continued focus on key initiatives as we navigated the challenges of a softer and increasingly competitive print market. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.3 billion, down 7% nominally or 5% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share [indiscernible] currency and lower supplies revenue. Hardware revenue was down $256 million, driven by lower volumes, primarily due to China market softness and aggressive pricing competition as our Japanese competitors have leveraged the weaker yen to their advantage. Total hardware units decreased 19%, driven by softer print demand in both home and commercial. Industrial graphics revenue, particularly hardware, remains pressured by persistent soft enterprise demand with the greatest impact seen in Europe.\nBy customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 6% or 5% in cost currency with units down 8%. Consumer revenue decreased 28% or down 26% in constant currency with units down 20%. ASPs were down year-over-year, driven by the promotional and competitive pricing and currency, offset partially by a favorable mix in both Consumer and Commercial. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, declining 2% nominally and roughly flat at constant currency, in line with expectations. The decline was driven by demand softness, particularly in China, lower usage and a lower installed base. This was offset partially by pricing actions earlier in the year and share gains\nPrint operating profit was approximately $800 million, down 12% year-on-year, and operating margin was 18.6%. Operating margin decreased 1.2 points, driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by structural cost savings and favorable mix. I would also like to note that we recorded accounting adjustments primarily related to a revenue contract in our Personal Systems segment. This has been reflected in our prior quarter compares which I just covered. It was not material to any of our previously filed financial statements and does not impact our current quarter results.\nWe continue to make strong progress on our Future Ready transformation in Q3, and we expect to deliver at least 40% of our 3-year gross annual structural run rate savings target of $1.4 billion for FY '23. As I've mentioned previously, we are working on a range of programs, which should enable us to achieve and potentially exceed key milestones for reducing costs across our business. Given the dynamic in Print, we are building the plan to accelerate cost reductions in that business.\nLet me update you on our progress in Q3. A key pillar of our transformation plan is focused on simplifying our product portfolio, significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. We've made great progress in Personal Systems as the actions we've taken have positively impacted our Q3 operating profit rate performance. Specifically, we continue to make great progress standardizing our Personal Systems platforms. At the end of Q3, we were nearly halfway to our goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately 1/3 by the end of FY '24.\nIn addition, we continue to reduce our commodity complexity, decreasing the number of client SKUs in our Personal Systems portfolio. In addition, we continue to look for new opportunities to reduce our cost structure across the organization. In Q3, for example, we optimized our media spend by consolidating our marketing programs and expanding our in-housing model further. We expect marketing will continue to deliver additional savings in headcount productivity and cost optimization as we unlock new digital solutions.\nWe are aggressively pressing forward with our AI agenda to reinvent various functions inside the company to accelerate both our products and productivity. We are enhancing our software coding practices to accelerate code development to improve speed, efficiencies and quality reviews. We are also leveraging our telemetry data to proactively address customer needs and to provide tailored recommendations and solutions to improve their efficiency and productivity.\nShifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations was solid at $1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $900 million. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This improved 2 days year-over-year, primarily due to days of inventory decreasing 1 day and days payable increasing 4 days, partially offset by days receivable increasing 3 days. The sequential growth in Personal Systems has improved the overall cash conversion cycle as expected.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we expect operational improvements will help drive a sequential increase in free cash flow, including an increase in Personal Systems revenue and an improvement in working capital. In Q3, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. In addition, we successfully completed a debt tender during the quarter, retiring greater than $1 billion of debt. Consistent with our outlook, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.\nLooking forward to Q4, we expect the challenging economic climate and continued demand softness will remain headwinds for our business near term. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY '23. We intend to start managing dilution this quarter as we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy over the long term while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.\nFor Personal Systems, the PC market size for the second half of calendar year '23 is smaller versus prior expectations, driven mainly by demand weakness in China. We expect industry CI levels will normalize by the end of Q4, resulting in improving ASPs as the quarter progresses but by less than initially expected and that enterprise demand will be softer. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q4 to be at the higher end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, driven by sequential revenue growth, lower commodity costs and strong structural and operating cost savings.\nIn Print, we expect overall Print revenue will rebound sequentially due to seasonality. We expect supplies revenue in FY '23 to decline by a low single-digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in Q4. We expect Print enterprise demand softness, including industrial, which will remain under pressure due to elongated sales cycles. We expect Print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for Q4, driven by disciplined pricing in a competitive environment and cost management that will help to offset softened demand.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We are lowering our FY '23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range by $0.11 at the midpoint. The primary factors driving our guidance include our revised outlook for Q4 due to the macro challenges I discussed previously and the effect of the accounting adjustments I referenced earlier, which impacts our H1 '23 non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.97 and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.77.\nWe expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.35, and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.07. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion for FY '23, in line with the low end of our prior guidance range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.\nWhen we began our fiscal year 6 months ago, we were clear about 2 things. We said we would focus on the things we can control to navigate a demand-constrained market in fiscal year '23. And we said we would continue driving progress against our long-term growth priorities. Halfway through the year, this is exactly what we have done. And I am pleased to say the actions we are taking as part of our future-ready plan have started to take hold. Because of this, we delivered non-GAAP EPS towards the high end of our guidance, and we have built strong momentum for the second half of the year.\nToday, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results and the progress against our future ready plan. I will then provide color on our business unit performance and I will close with some insight into how we see the balance of the year before turning the call over to Marie.\nStarting with our results. Net revenue was $12.9 billion, that's down 22% or 18% in constant currency. As expected, the industry-wide headwinds we described last quarter continued to impact our business. Against this backdrop, our teams did an excellent job controlling our costs, managing our pricing and shifting our mix. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.80. We also grew non-GAAP EPS and operating profit quarter-over-quarter. And we delivered on our year-to-date cost target, keeping us on track to deliver at least 40% of our 3-year savings by the end of fiscal year '23.\nA key part of our strategy is to reinvest savings into innovation. We are doing this in our core business and our key growth areas. We believe this is very important because even though both our core and growth markets are impacted by the current macro environment, we see opportunities to further strengthen our position during this down cycle. Our innovation was on full display at our Amplify Partner Conference in March, where we launched more than 50 new products and solutions. This was our largest channel event of the past 4 years, attracting more than 1,500 of our top partners from around the world.\nIt has sparked strong energy and momentum across our sales teams and our partners could see the significant progress we are making in our key growth areas. The benefit of our acquisition of Poly was one of our key areas of focus at the conference. Hybrid work is a long-term secular trend that we believe will continue to create attractive growth opportunities. We showed our partners how we are leveraging our combined hybrid system portfolio to create new solutions for customers. A great example is our new Poly video operating system, which uses AI-driven speaker tracking and auto framing to enable better remote collaboration. We also showcased the progress we are making in workforce services and solutions, including the launch of HP Wolf \"Protect and Trace\".\nThis is the world's first digital service capable of remotely locating blocking and [indiscernible] a PC, even if it is turned off or off-line. And we unveiled new advanced computing solutions through our Zbook line including specific offerings designed for data science, AI and machine learning applications.\nLet me now give you some more color on what we saw this quarter in each business. Looking first at the market level, global economic uncertainty remains elevated. The macro environment is challenging across more geographies. We continue to see cautious consumer discretionary spending, while enterprises are delaying capital investments.\nWith that as a context, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion. That's down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Like last quarter, we estimate that the sellout to customers exceeded sell-in to the channel, which means that end-user demand was stronger than revenue shipments. This helped us further reduce our channel inventory. There are still pockets where we need to improve, but we are making good progress as per our plan. Our peers operating margin was 5.4%, in line with our expectations.\nPS margins remained flat sequentially, reflecting our disciplined mix strategy and cost reductions in a competitive pricing environment. We delivered solid per services growth with particularly strong performance in digital services. We also continue to improve our execution. Our teams are showing a relentless drive to win in the market. We gained PC share in calendar Q1, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And we are not simply gaining share for the sake of share, we are gaining in more profitable areas such as commercial, where we now have the #1 position and gained 2.5 share points year-over-year. We will keep acting with urgency to build on this momentum while improving our results in segments like premium and gaming. And while the broader gaming market is currently challenged, it remains a massive long-term opportunity where we continue to invest. This quarter, we launched a wide range of [indiscernible] Victor's gaming innovation incorporating the latest NVIDIA RTX graphics technology.\nWe are equally focused on the opportunities, generative AI is starting to create for our PS business. We are actively working with our major software and silicon partners to engineer new architectures that will integrate AI applications into everyday use cases. This is a very exciting opportunity. In the same way, the Internet age fundamentally changed the way people use computers. I believe the age of AI will transform the role PCs play in our lives.\nTurning to Print. Revenue was $4.7 billion, that's down 5% or 2% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand and aggressive pricing in the consumer print market. This was offset by favorable mix in our office business, including 10% revenue growth in commercial hardware and supplies performed better than expected, driven by better demand in office. We delivered print operating margin of 19%. This shows the continued benefit of our disciplined cost management as well as favorable pricing in office as we bring strong innovation to market.\nFor example, this quarter, we launched a new lineup of Laserjet printing systems designed to help businesses maximize productivity. We also continue to make progress rebalancing overall system profitability. Our HP plus and big tank printers once again represented more than 50% of our shipments in the quarter. We gained share year-over-year and sequentially in big tank and Instant ink grew revenue and new enrollees.\nJust as we have done in Personal Systems, we need to improve our execution in print to gain share. We aim to do this in a thoughtful way, focused on winning in the right areas to drive profitable growth and increasing our mix of profitable customers.\nTurning to our Industrial segment. Graphics continued to be impacted by macro headwinds. While flexible packaging and folding cartons are back to growth, this was offset by a decline in leveling. In 3D, the business returned to growth this quarter with good momentum in both plastics and metals. And we recently introduced our new HP Jet Fusion automation solutions, which simplify workflows and reduce cost for high-volume 3D production. Overall, this quarter's results show that we are making progress against our priorities.\nYes, we have more work ahead, but we are continually upping our game as we execute our future-ready plan, and our teams are playing to win. We also continued to win the right way.\nNext month, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report. It will disclose the continued progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. As you know, this work is integrated into how we run the company. It has been an important factor of new sales wins for the past several years.\nAnd we see this trend continuing across commercial and consumer segments. Going forward, we are taking a more comprehensive approach to measuring the total business impact of our sustainability initiatives. Specifically, we have adopted the corporate night sustainable economic taxonomy. This is a well-established industry benchmark to measure what's called sustainable revenue. This measure allows us to quantify revenue generated from products and services that meet leading environmental standards and reduce our environmental impact.\nUsing the corporate night methodology, sustainable revenue represented more than 60% of our total revenue in fiscal year '22.\nLet me now turn to capital allocation. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach. We are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time and less opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA.\nAs planned, we did not repurchase any shares in Q2 given where we finished the quarter on our gross leverage ratio.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect our second half performance to be stronger than the first half. We see this being driven by improved channel inventory and seasonality, primarily in Personal Systems as well as the positive impact of our cost savings measures.\nEntering the second half of the year, we believe we have full line of sight to deliver on our structural cost reduction goal for fiscal year '23. We remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. We have talked before about creating a simpler, more focused company. There are many ways to deliver on this, such as reducing our number of SKUs rationalizing our portfolio or teaming our various lines of business.\nWe will continue to approach this work in a way that enables us to best meet customer needs while creating value for our shareholders. We are also capitalizing on infrastructure investment to become a more digital company. This is driving greater speed and efficiency across our operations while enabling new value propositions for customers as we expand our services and subscription offerings.\nTo sum up, we are confident in our future ready plan. We strongly believe we have the right strategy and team in place to deliver on our priorities and drive long-term sustainable growth and our continued execution of our plan will allow us to emerge stronger as the market improves.\nLet me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe delivered solid financial results in Q2 against the backdrop of a tough macroeconomic environment. We generated sequential growth in non-GAAP operating profit and margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Non-GAAP EPS was at the high end of our guidance range, while free cash flow was better than we expected. We delivered these results by remaining focused on prudently managing costs and optimizing our cost structure further under our future-ready plan.\nAt the same time, we prioritize strategic investments that will help drive future growth when the macro economy recovers. We remain focused on what we can control in the current environment, which enabled us to deliver on our commitments for Q2.\nNow let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.9 billion in the quarter, down 22% nominally and 18% in constant currency driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 21%, EMEA declined 22% and APJ declined 7%. Gross margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 2.5 points year-on-year, primarily due to mix shift to print and lower commodity costs in Personal Systems, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing, particularly in consumer print.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 14% of revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by rigorous cost management, including future-ready structural cost savings and lower variable comp, partially offset by the Poly acquisition. In addition, recall last year, we provided aid related to the war in Ukraine.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 22.4%. non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $172 million, relatively flat sequentially and up year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.28 or 26% to $0.80 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $269 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges more than offset by other tax adjustments and nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.07, mostly due to onetime noncash tax benefits related to tax planning.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion, down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial driven by weaker economic activity as customers in both market segments were more cautious with spending.\nDespite this, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q1 by 1.3 points year-over-year, driven by gains in the commercial market, where we improved our share by 2.5 points. Improved market share contributed to commercial representing greater than 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter, while constituting about [ 53% ] of our PC unit mix.\nWe continue to make solid progress on reducing our channel inventory level sequentially, but levels remain slightly elevated for us and across the industry. As a result, we continue to see aggressive pricing in the quarter. We estimate sellout declined less than sell-in during Q2, which means that end-user demand was stronger than sell-in shipments.\nDrilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 39% and commercial was down 24%. Lower volumes, FX and increased promotional pricing remained headwinds, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue. We increased our market share in high-value more profitable segments, including commercial and premium notebooks. Our strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Personal Systems delivered almost $450 million of operating profit with operating margins of 5.4%. Our margin declined 1.5 points year-over-year primarily due to currency increased pricing competition and the higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs and structural cost savings and services mix.\nIn Print, our results reflect our focus on key initiatives and improving execution within the context of a softer print market. In Q2, total print revenue was $4.7 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven mostly by lower consumer hardware and lower supplies revenue and currency. Hardware revenue was down about $100 million driven by lower volumes and competitive pricing actions in consumer, partially offset by an increase in commercial hardware revenue. Industrial Graphics revenue declined, reflecting continued demand weakness in the enterprise space.\nTotal hardware units decreased 4%, driven by market share loss and soft home printer demand. By customer segment, commercial revenue increased 5% or 8% in constant currency with units roughly flat. Consumer revenue decreased 19% or down 15% in constant currency with units down 5%.\nASPs were mixed. Favorable mix shift towards commercial helped to offset promotional pricing and incremental price reductions in consumer across multiple geographies to remain competitive. Supplies revenue was $3 billion, declining 4% nominally and 3% in constant currency; better than expected. The decline was driven primarily by lower usage as expected as home printing normalizes further a lower installed base and a gradual recovery in commercial. This was partially offset by favorable pricing actions last year and [indiscernible] New Year timing as well as continued market share gains.\nPrint operating profit was approximately $900 million, down 5% year-on-year and operating margin was 19%. Operating margin decreased 0.1 points driven by promotional pricing, higher commodity costs and unfavorable currency, partially offset by cost improvements and pricing actions. The cost [indiscernible] improvements were largely due to lower variable comp and transformation plan related savings. Our future-ready transformation continues to build on our strong start through the first half of FY '23 and we remain on track to deliver at least 40% of structural run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in FY '23. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive further structural construction across our business.\nLet me update you on our progress in Q2. We further enhanced our digital capabilities, driving additional automation and process improvements. In our Workforce Solutions and Services business, we harvested more proactive data insights from more connected devices with our enhanced diagnostic tools that drove repair cost efficiencies. In our supply chain, we delivered significant improvements in reducing portfolio complexity, improving continuity of supply and increasing our forecast accuracy to facilitate material cost and profit improvements. We saw further opportunities to drive structural cost reductions through headcount reductions and driving efficiencies in our core businesses.\nIn Print, we focused on platform consolidations and road map reductions in our large format business. Looking ahead, we see potentially significant and incremental opportunities to leverage AI and generative AI to positively impact both our products and solutions and how we operate. We are actively exploring opportunities such as expanding our product portfolio to include a new category of high-performance PCs, accelerating software development productivity and enhancing the customer service experience to drive higher value offers while optimizing pricing.\nShifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was solid at $0.6 billion and free cash flow of $0.5 billion was better than expected. Free cash flow results benefited from better purchasing linearity. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter. This improved 4 days sequentially, primarily due to days payable increasing 10 days more than offsetting an increase in DOI. While we decreased our inventory by $0.1 billion sequentially in Q2, the upward pressure on days inventory was driven by strategic buys, increased ocean transit mix and a change in business mix. We have more opportunity to improve our core inventory turns and are focused on doing that. But when it is economic to do so, we intend to continue to drive value via strategic buys or more sea transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory.\nIn Q2, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. Given where we finished the quarter on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter consistent with our outlook. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy longer term, but near term, we'll continue to manage our leverage profile prudently and maintain an investment-grade credit rating in the current challenging environment.\nLooking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY '23, we expect the macro environment will remain challenged and we will remain focused on rationalizing our cost structure further while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We are narrowing our FY '23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range, reflecting greater visibility into the potential range of outcomes for H2 '23. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY '23. For Personal Systems, we expect our and the industry's channel inventory will normalize in Q3 and the back half of the year will be seasonally stronger from an end-user demand perspective. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q3 to be in the mid-range of our 5% to 7% long-term target, driven by increased volumes, the continued progress on normalizing CI levels as well as further cost reductions and efficiencies.\nFor FY '23, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing future-ready transformation savings.\nIn Print, we continue to expect suppliers revenue at FY '23 to decline by a low to mid-single digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in the back half of the year. We expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for H2 '23, driven by disciplined pricing and cost management and continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2023. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91, and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.71. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50, and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 and $3.11. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY '23.\nAnd now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.",

Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today. Since our Q4 call last November, the macro volatility we described has continued. Our approach remains consistent. We are taking decisive actions to improve our performance while continuing to invest in long-term growth.\nBy doing what we said we would do, we delivered on our Q1 EPS guidance. And we are reaffirming our full year outlook. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on 3 areas: I will begin by summarizing our results and progress against our future ready plan. I will then cover our business unit performance. And I will conclude with our outlook before handing the call to Marie.\nStarting with our results. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter. That's down 19% nominally and 15% in constant currency. This reflects industry-wide headwinds including corporate budget tightening that has started to impact large enterprise demand. Despite this top line pressure, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.75. This is in line with our previously provided outlook, and it reflects the actions we are taking on cost as well as disciplined execution on pricing and mix.\nThe future ready plan we shared with you last quarter is already having an impact. As a reminder, the plan has 2 primary objectives. One is to further reduce our cost structure. The second is to continue to assess and optimize our overall portfolio and to develop a required operational capabilities to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We are making clear progress in both areas.\nIn terms of costs, our teams have done an excellent job reducing spend and driving efficiencies. We delivered on our Q1 cost target, and we are on track to deliver at least 40% of our 3-year savings by the end of fiscal year '23. This is allowing us to maintain our investments in long-term growth.\nCollectively, our key growth businesses grew double digits in Q1, including Poly. We're investing in a down market so we can accelerate our growth when the external environment improves. For example, new hybrid work models are fueling demand for peripherals and other collaboration solutions. We will now refer to this part of our business as hybrid systems. Our hybrid systems business more than doubled year-over-year, and our Poly integration is going very well. The combined HP and Poly portfolio is creating better experiences for customers and building a strong funnel.\nHybrid work is a long-term secular trend driving innovation across our portfolio. We introduced more than 25 new products that earn over 50 innovation awards at CES. This included our new Dragonfly pro series, which we co-engineer with AMD. It reflects how we are building deeper partnerships with our silicon partners to co-create better experiences for customers.\nIn addition, we launched our new Poly Voyager wireless earbuds, with 3 mics per earbud they deliver higher quality voice transmission and audio experiences. We are also doubling down on services and subscriptions. There is growing demand for new consumption models that allow us to deliver a better value proposition. And we have created dedicated teams to drive greater focus on these growth opportunities.\nThis supports our strategy to foster lifetime customer relationships and drive recurring revenue. Last year, we created our Workforce Services & Solutions organization. It is providing customers with an integrated set of offerings and expanding our addressable market. We delivered healthy WSS revenue growth in Q1, and we drove margin expansion by shifting more of our mix to digital services and achieving cost efficiencies. We are excited about the opportunities ahead.\nOur investments in software, security and AI will enable us to develop new solutions. For example, our HP workstations and data science stack is accelerating machine learning and AI workflows, which is leading to the creation of a new category of high-performance PCs specifically designed for data science and AI applications. And we are partnering closely with NVIDIA on new products and platforms for this growing use case.\nAnd this quarter, we also created a new organization focused on consumer subscriptions. It's designed to expand upon the success of Instant Ink. Our long-term goal is to ultimately offer the HP portfolio as a subscription.\nLet me now touch on our business unit performance, starting with Personal Systems. At the market level, we continue to see soft demand in consumer and commercial. We also see pricing pressure given elevated channel inventory across the industry. In addition, corporate budget tightening began to affect large enterprise demand. This is leading to longer sales cycles in our commercial business. Against that backdrop, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion. That's down 24% or 20% in constant currency.\nRollout to our customers was higher than selling to the channel with a corresponding reduction in channel inventory. Our estimate is that end-user demand was stronger than revenue shipments. PS operating margin was better than expected at 5.4%, and we grew operating profit sequentially. This reflects our actions on cost and a favorable mix shift improving our performance.\nWe accelerated the growth of our hybrid systems and PS services businesses, and we remain focused on growing profitable share. In calendar Q4, we grew share sequentially in the high-value segments we have prioritized. Our commercial PC share increased by 2.8 points. And our overall PC share grew by 2.5 points as we regained the #1 or #2 position in all regions.\nTurning to Print. Current market conditions are more stable, and we see different dynamics playing out by business. The consumer print market continues to see demand softness and pricing pressure. In supplies, the situation in Q1 was better than expected and we continue to see strong adoption of profit upfront and subscription models. The commercial print market is being impacted by macro uncertainty corporate budget tightening and the uneven pace of return to office.\nWithin commercial, office printing has seen improvement as the supply situation normalizes. Taking all this into account, our Q1 Print revenue was $4.6 billion. That's down 4.5% or 2% in constant currency. We delivered Print operating margin of 18.9%. Operating profit was flat year-over-year in a very tough market. This shows that our strategy is working.\nDisciplined cost management and favorable pricing in office had a positive impact. Our office hardware revenue grew 13% year-over-year or 5% sequentially, and we gained share in office quarter-over-quarter in calendar Q4. Although return to office is uneven the pages per device remain in the range of 80% of pre-COVID expected levels. We also continued to rebalance system profitability. HP+ and big tank printers represented 56% of printer shipments in Q1 and we gained share sequentially in big tank.\nWe now offer the industry's broadest lineup of tanks from the low end of the market to the world's first and only laser tank printer. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in Instant Ink surpassing 12 million subscribers. And we drove early adoption of our Instant Ink with paper add on.\nIndustrial graphics and 3D were impacted by macro headwinds, with revenue down year-over-year. We view this as a short-term situation. and we plan to continue investing in these areas to drive long-term growth and value creation. This quarter, we expanded our Jet Fusion lineup and we drove adoption of our metal jet solution with key customers such as John Deere and Schneider Electric.\nAcross our business, sustainable impact remains at the core of our strategy and our leadership on important topics like climate change, human rights and digital equity is building trust in our brand. and it's helping us win new business. It's also driving innovation.\nOur new all-in-one lineup is a great example. It includes the world's first PC with recycled coffee grounds, which are used in the finish of the device. The enclosure is made with more than 40% post-consumer recycled plastics. The arm stand uses 75% recycled aluminum. And the stand base uses 100% reclaimed polyester. We have also reduced the product's packaging, so we can ship up to 66% more units per pallet.\nI am proud we were recently named America's Most Responsible Company by Newsweek for the fourth consecutive year.\nLet me turn to capital allocation. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, and we are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time, unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise. And as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA.\nGiven the volatility of the market and our growing contractual business, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we moderated our share repurchase activity in Q1 as planned while maintaining a leverage ratio within our target range.\nLooking ahead, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect our second half performance to improve relative to the first half, driven by our cost-saving measures and as the improved channel inventory levels create a more normalized pricing environment. This is consistent with the view we shared in November. The PC market in units may regress to pre-COVID levels in the short term, but we expect it will remain at a structurally higher level with more premium and high-value mix.\nAs we said last quarter, we expect the overall print market to be down low single digits this year. This is mainly driven by the challenging macro environment and slower-than-expected return to the office. And as I said at the top of the call, we are maintaining our full year financial outlook.\nTo sum up, we are operating in a tough market right now. But we are taking decisive actions as part of our future ready plan to improve our performance, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver. By focusing on what we can control, we believe we are well positioned to navigate near-term volatility. And by maintaining investments in our growth priorities we are strengthening the company for the future. This is what we did in Q1. And it's what you can expect from us moving forward.\nLet me now hand the call over to Marie for more details.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Enrique said, we continue to focus on what we can control and deliver on the commitments we have made. In Q1, we remain disciplined in rigorously managing our costs and investing strategically while delivering on our outlook. However, our results were impacted by ongoing soft demand.\nMacroeconomic challenges persisted and corporate budget tightening began to affect large enterprise demand this quarter. We are adapting quickly to the current environment but see continued opportunity to drive further improvement in our cost structure and operational execution.\nLet me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 19% nominally and 15% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 16%, EMEA declined 15%, and APJ declined 13%. Gross margin was 20.3% in the quarter, up 0.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to improved commodities and favorable print mix, partially offset by competitive pricing, including currency.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion or 12.5% of revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by lower variable compensation, rigorous cost management and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by the Poly acquisition. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 28.3%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $183 million, up primarily due to higher interest expense driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.35 or 32% to $0.75, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $262 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, debt extinguishment costs and other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. Let me start with pointing out that we have changed our revenue reporting presentation for Personal Systems this quarter. We are now reporting revenue by business capability, consumer and commercial versus our previous disclosure by product category, which better aligns with how we think about and manage the business.\nThe composition of our consumer and commercial business capabilities remains consistent with what we have outlined in the past, with the exception of Poly, which is now included in commercial. Also note that Q1 reflects the first full quarter of Poly results.\nIn Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion, down 24% or 20% in constant currency, with FX headwinds as expected. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial, driven by soft demand and a tough prior year compare. And while commercial constituted about 60% of our units, it represented approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter.\nWe made solid progress on reducing our channel inventory levels sequentially. However, levels remained elevated for us and across the industry. With that, combined with improved supply availability, pricing competition intensified incrementally in the quarter. Our backlog remains consistent with prepandemic levels and still skews favorably towards commercial higher-value units.\nDrilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 36% and Commercial was down 18%. Lower volumes, FX and increased promotional pricing were again headwinds. Within Commercial, these were partially offset by favorable mix. During calendar Q4, we improved our go-to-market execution and grew our overall market share sequentially. We also increased our market share in high-value, more profitable segments, including commercial, desktops and notebooks. Our focus continues to be on driving profitable share growth, especially in the premium segment of our consumer and commercial markets.\nPersonal Systems delivered almost $500 million of operating profit with operating margins of 5.4%. Our margin declined 2.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency headwinds, increased promotional pricing and favorable prior period R&D partner funding. This was partially offset by Poly contributions and lower costs, including variable compensation and commodity costs.\nIn Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and growing our NPV positive units as well as the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven mostly by lower supplies revenue and currency. Hardware revenue was relatively flat, driven by favorable pricing actions in Commercial, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing actions.\nIndustrial Graphics and services revenue declined slightly, reflecting emerging demand weakness in the enterprise space. Total hardware units increased 2% as component availability and logistics constraints improved sequentially, augmented by better-than-expected China demand. We continued to make solid progress reducing our backlog and are largely back to our pre-pandemic level.\nBy customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 2% or 5% in constant currency, with units down 8%. Consumer revenue was down 3% or up 1% in constant currency with units up 3%. Consumer printer demand remained soft in the Americas and EMEA regions, driving incremental promotional activity as supply constraints continue to ease. Commercial hardware demand remained tepid due to both the slow and uneven pace at which the return to office progressing and enterprise budget tightening.\nSupplies revenue was $2.9 billion, declining 7% nominally and 6% in constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by further normalization in home printing and a gradual recovery in Commercial. This was partially offset by favorable pricing actions and continued market share gains in ink and toner. Print operating profit was $870 million, essentially flat year-on-year and operating margin was 18.9%.\nOperating margin increased 0.8 points driven by pricing actions and cost improvements, partially offset by promotional pricing of favorable currency and higher commodity costs. The cost improvements were largely due to lower variable comp expense management and transformation savings.\nNow let me turn to our future-ready efforts. We saw strong progress on our plan in Q1 and are on track to deliver at least 40% of our targeted $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '23. In Personal Systems, we are targeting structural savings by streamlining our portfolio to better target customer needs.\nWe are increasing leverage in our product and engineering operations by standardizing on fewer platforms to reduce component complexity. We expect these initiatives to reduce duplication and improve our agility and response time to shifting market needs. We also took actions to optimize costs in our corporate business where we drove significant savings. We continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our core businesses, particularly in office print and in our supplies, supply chain, including headcount reductions.\nIn addition, we continue to see benefits from our investments to transform our customer support and services organization enhancing our capabilities to provide a more digital enabled customer-centric support experience. We continue digitizing our customer support engagement assets using AI-based interactive voice response technology. We expect this initiative will help automate our processes to deliver a more seamless and connected support experience.\nLastly, in January, as part of our future-ready target to reduce employee head count by 4,000 to 6,000, we announced a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. The offer provided eligible employees the opportunity to retire from HP with enhanced benefits. More than 900 participants have opted into the plan with the majority expected to exit during Q2. I continue to be confident in our ability to drive operating cost reductions consistent with our future-ready goals, enabling investments in our key growth areas.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was nominally negative and free cash flow was an outflow of $0.2 billion, in line with our expectations. Our results were impacted by normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable comp payments as well as restructuring charges and lower volumes in Personal Systems.\nAdditionally, our free cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of receipts and payments related to our factoring program. This is expected to be net neutral to our full year free cash flow.\nThe cash conversion cycle was minus 22 days in the quarter. This increased 7 days sequentially, primarily due to an increase in strategic buys driving up DOI and an unfavorable business mix impacting both DOI and DPO.\nWhile we decreased our inventory $0.3 billion sequentially in Q1, we have more work to better align our inventory to our business volumes through operational excellence. We will, however, continue to take advantage of economic opportunities like strategic buys, or more seed transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory.\nIn Q1, we returned approximately $360 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $259 million in cash dividends. We finished the quarter towards the high end of our target leverage range. Consistent with our disciplined financial management and our strategy to prudently manage our leverage profile and maintain our credit rating in the current challenging environment, we limited our Q1 share repurchases to an amount needed to offset share dilution.\nLooking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY '23, we expect the macro and demand environment will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will remain competitive. We remain focused on what we can control as we navigate these difficult market conditions. We will continue to rigorously manage costs, streamline operations and improve our performance as the year progresses while continuing to invest in our growth businesses.\nIn particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '23, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges I will discuss shortly. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal 2023.\nWe will continue to focus on driving structural cost savings and efficiencies in our business consistent with the progress we made in Q1 regarding our future ready transformation strategy. We expect these cost savings will scale into the back half of the year.\nGiven recent weakness in the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency to be about a 3 percentage year-over-year headwind for FY '23. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.7 billion for FY '23 based on Q1 as a run rate for the year.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY '23, with the second half of FY '23 stronger than the first. As a reminder, our FY '23 free cash flow outlook includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash outflows.\nTurning to Personal Systems. We now expect the overall PC market unit TAM to decline by a high teens percent in FY '23. Specifically, for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will remain under pressure near term and decline sequentially by a high single digit. We expect revenue to improve over the course of the back half of the year as elevated channel inventory levels are expected to normalize by early fiscal Q3.\nWe expect to continue to drive improved mix shifts toward high value, more profitable units and services and expect this will help partially offset the headwinds we've discussed today. We expect Personal Systems margins to be in the lower half of our 5% to 7% long-term range in Q2 as commodities and logistics costs improve in the quarter. But given elevated industry and HP channel inventory levels, pricing continues to be very competitive.\nFor FY '23, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing future-ready transformation savings. In Print, we expect consumer demand softness will persist and macro uncertainty and corporate budgeting tightening will remain headwinds for commercial. Disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as office gradually improves should help to partially offset these trends.\nWith regard to print supply chain, similar to what we saw in Q1, we expect component shortages will continue to improve but persist into at least Q2 particularly for office hardware, providing continued support for favorable pricing. Regarding supplies, we expect Q2 revenue in constant currency to decline by a high single digit versus our previous expectation to be down closer to double digits. Given its variability, we do not believe inter-quarter growth is indicative of our long-term supplies growth.\nWe continue to expect revenue to decline in FY '23 by low to mid-single digits in constant currency. We now expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% range for Q2, driven by continued hardware constraints. We expect FY '23 margins also will be above the high end of our range, driven by disciplined pricing, continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability and rigorous cost management, including future ready transformation savings.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2023. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.83 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.60 and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.62.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress against both our short- and long-term strategic priorities in a demanding environment. I am confident we are taking the right actions and making the right decisions to create long-term value for our shareholders. I'll stop here so we could open the line for your questions.",

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of IR, HP Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.\nWe posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm going to focus my remarks on 3 key topics. First, I will recap our Q4 and full year results. Then I will discuss actions we are taking to position our business for the future, including a new 3-year plan focused on structural cost reductions that will drive the next phase of our digital transformation and the investment in our growth businesses. And I will close by talking about our outlook for 2023.\nBut let me start by setting some important context. It has now been 3 years since I became CEO. From the day I took over, my top priority has been to deliver long-term, sustainable, profitable growth while transforming our business for the future, and we have made important progress. We started by launching an aggressive plan to unlock value. We implemented a new global operating model that brought us closer to customers and helped us significantly reduce structural costs.\nWe initiated actions to rebalance profitability in our Print business. And we began to diversify our portfolio to capture more value per customer. We expanded into adjacent growth categories such as peripherals. We extended our services and solutions offering, and we shifted more of our business to subscription and contractual models. These changes helped us to improve our operational performance. They also position us well for the disruption caused by the pandemic, which we were able to use as a catalyst to accelerate our transformation.\nAnd our track record over these past few years provides a window into what you can expect from us moving forward. We have proven to be resilient in the face of changing market conditions. We delivered strong free cash flow, controlled our costs and scaled our growth businesses. At the same time, we will continue challenging ourselves to do better regardless of the external environment, and there are areas where we need to do better.\nWhen we see things that aren't working, we will fix them, and we will embrace every opportunity to improve our performance because our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders deserve nothing less. You can expect us to take the same approach in 2023 and beyond.\nLet me now turn to our results for the quarter. Revenue was $14.8 billion, down 11% nominally or 8% in constant currency. This reflects macro headwinds in the market and is very consistent with what we described last quarter. We continue to focus on what we can control. We managed our pricing mix and costs to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, which is towards the high end of our previously provided outlook. And we delivered strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, while returning $1 billion to shareholders.\nVery importantly, we also maintained our momentum in our growth portfolio. In short, we did what we said we were going to do last quarter. Turning to our Q4 business unit performance. Personal Systems revenue were $10.3 billion. That's down 9% in constant currency year-over-year, but up 2% sequentially or 4% in constant currency, including 2 months of Poly's results. The Poly integration is going well so far with the business performing better than expected.\nWe continue to receive very positive feedback from the market about the opportunity ahead. We are well positioned to accelerate our peripheral growth, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP operating profit and EPS in fiscal year '23. Our PS operating margin was 4.5% in the quarter, below our long-term target range due to increased competitive pricing, particularly in EMEA. Still, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of PS as we navigate near-term volatility in the market. The PS TAM remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we are making progress against our long-term strategic priorities.\nThis includes shifting more of our mix to high-value segments. In Q4, our Commercial business continues to account for more than 2/3 of our overall PS revenue. However, we are not satisfied with our PS market share results this quarter. We know we can do better, and we will. We see many opportunities to improve our execution and gain share in key segments of the market. In Print, revenue was $4.5 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency, largely due to continued softness in the consumer market, both hardware and supplies and supply constraints.\nThat said, our operating margin of 19.9% was well above our target range, reflecting disciplined cost management and pricing. Our Commercial business made a good recovery during the quarter, with office hardware revenue growing double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was offset by declines in home and supplies, both of which were in line with our expectations. We also made progress against our plan to rebalance system profitability and further reduce our reliance on transactional supplies. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing about 55% of our printer shipments. And we had another good quarter in industrial graphics and 3D, both of which grew revenue year-over-year and sequentially.\nNow turning to the full year. Our Q4 results capped off a solid 2022 in the face of tough market conditions in the second half. Fiscal year '22 revenue was $63 billion. That's down 1% nominally and up 1% in constant currency. We exceeded our full year revenue target for our key growth businesses, each of which delivered double-digit organic growth. Collectively, they generated more than $11 billion in revenue. That's $1 billion above our target and reflects the strong momentum we are building.\nWe delivered non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. That's up 8% year-over-year and within our target range. We generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We also continued to advance our Sustainable Impact Agenda. This is a key differentiator for our brand, and I am proud of the work our teams are doing to make it a competitive advantage.\nThis year, we were the only technology company globally to receive an A rating from CDP, one of the world's leading NGOs dedicated to environmental sustainability reporting. And almost all the new printers, laptops, notebooks, displays and workstations we launched in 2022 included recycled materials. Sustainable impact will remain a key strategic priority moving forward.\nFiscal year '22 also marked the completion of our 3-year value creation plan, and we exceeded all the key targets we set. In addition to delivering on our financial commitments, the plan drove important investments in our future. Most notably, we invested in our digital infrastructure to begin replatform in the company. And we invested in both R&D and M&A to accelerate the growth of our businesses. These investments have strengthened our resilience and positioned as well for the volatile market ahead.\nI now want to talk about what comes next because while we have delivered on our value plan, we are not done, and we have initiated the next phase of our transformation. Our ultimate goal is to create a Future Ready HP. Future Ready is our strategic framework that we are driving across the company. It has 2 primary objectives. One is to develop the portfolio and operational capabilities needed to drive sustainable growth. The other is to further reduce our cost.\nMarie will talk more about the cost side of this transformation. Today, I am going to walk you through 3 key elements of our Future Ready plan, digital transformation, portfolio optimization and operational efficiency. They are also the major drivers of savings of the plan we are announcing today.\nI will start with digital transformation. We are continuing the process of digitizing the company. We plan to capitalize on the infrastructure investments we made over the past 3 years to simplify and accelerate many processes through automation and end-to-end management. For example, we are launching end-to-end initiatives that will enable faster conversion from lead generation to free cash flow.\nOur digital transformation will also drive productivity, speed and quality of our execution across supply chain, customer support and go-to-market. In addition, our new digital backbone will enable us to scale key growth businesses by delivering new customer value propositions such as personalized services and solutions that allow us to capture more value per customer. The second area of focus is on optimizing our portfolio. In the current environment, I believe it's essential that we zero in on businesses where we can drive significant competitive advantage and market leadership.\nWe have an opportunity to create a more focused and more growth-oriented line of businesses based on innovation that meets the changing needs of our customers. We also have opportunities to simplify our portfolio. For example, in Personal Systems, there is an opportunity to significantly reduce our number of unique SKUs. And we plan to significantly reduce complexity and cost in businesses where we don't expect to achieve growth but can drive value.\nA significant portion of the savings we generate is expected to be invested to drive innovation in our key growth businesses to increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll give you some examples. In hybrid work solutions, we intend to leverage the combined strength of Poly and HP to drive attach, while expanding in software and services to deliver differentiated hybrid work solutions for meeting rooms and home offices.\nIn gaming, we see significant opportunity to drive better collective experiences through both software and hardware. And we will create seamless experiences across PCs, displays and peripherals. Through our newly informed workforce services and solutions business, we will simplify IT management for customers through new Device as a Service offering tailored for hybrid ecosystem. We will also expand our consumer services offerings beyond Instant Ink to include new areas such as paper and print hardware.\nIn industrial graphics, we will continue to lead the industry in innovation that drives that analog to digital transformation. And in 3D, we will continue to invest in our own 3D end-to-end printing applications and in our Metals portfolio. And we expect these businesses collectively to continue growing organically double digits next year. The third area of focus I'm going to cover today is delivering operational excellence. We plan to continue to optimize our performance by driving efficiencies, simplifying organizational structure and removing unnecessary costs.\nThis work will build on our previous transformation initiatives to unlock new structural savings. We will be taking actions across the company to reduce our variable spend and structural costs. For example, in our Print business, we will further reduce our core fixed cost structure and align it to post-pandemic market sizing. And our consumer subscription offerings will allow us to be more efficient in simplifying our portfolio.\nThe cost actions of our Future Ready plan will generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by year-end fiscal year '25. They will allow us to mitigate near-term market headwinds, mitigate softness in the core businesses and just as importantly, to maintain investments in long-term growth. As part of the actions we are taking, we will be reducing the size of our workforce over the next 3 years. We expect to reduce it by 4,000 to 6,000 people. These are the toughest decisions we have to make because they impact colleagues we care deeply about.\nWe are committed to treating people with care and respect, including financial and career services support to help them find their next opportunity. But while these are difficult decisions, we are doing what's best for our business. Let me now provide some color on our outlook for the year ahead. We expect to operate in a challenging macro environment during fiscal year '23. In our guide, we are not assuming a significant economic recovery over the next 12 months. We expect our second half performance to improve, mostly driven by the cost-saving measures we are implementing.\nWe plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, applying the same framework we have used during the last 3 years. We plan to continue to return at least 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x.\nGiven the volatility of the market, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we will temporarily reduce our share repurchase activity in the near term. We are confident in the actions we are taking to navigate current market conditions and drive long-term value creation. And today marks the start of the next phase of our strategic journey. While our growth trajectory may be uneven in the face of volatile market conditions, we remain confident to grow low single digits over the long term. Based on our track record over these past 3 years, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments.\nLet me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 results were impacted by many of the same macroeconomic challenges we highlighted last quarter, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand, FX and inflation. That said, we are adapted quickly to the current environment and have demonstrated disciplined cost management to deliver solid results to finish out the year.\nIn addition, we returned significant capital to our shareholders while successfully closing our acquisition of Poly. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities across our business and are confident we have the right strategy and portfolio of assets to drive long-term value creation.\nToday, I will cover our Q4 results and a recap of FY '22 followed by details about the cost transformation component of Future Ready, building upon the foundation we laid in our previous program and then finish with our outlook for Q1 and FY '23. Turning to our Q4 results. Net revenue was $14.8 billion in the quarter, down 11% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin was 18.4% in the quarter, down 1.2 points year-on-year driven by FX and increased pricing competition, particularly in PS.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion or 10.7% of revenue, down 18% year-on-year. In Q4, we installed further rigor in our cost management with OpEx down sequentially, excluding Poly. Year-on-year, we reduced our OpEx spend by nearly $350 million by prioritizing our spend and reducing variable compensation, while also capturing additional structural cost savings under our transformation plan. At the same time, we made and expect to continue to make prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas, which Enrique outlined earlier.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 15%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $128 million for the quarter, up sequentially, largely as a result of our acquisition of Poly. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased 10% to $0.85 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net expenses totaling $855 million, primarily related to acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangibles, tax adjustments and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was 0, mostly due to onetime noncash tax expenses.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $10.3 billion, down 13% or 9% in constant currency. This compares to the 3-point headwind we had expected. PS revenue includes just 2 months of Poly's results following the successful completion of the acquisition in late August. Total units were down 21% on tough compares. We also saw pricing competition increased sequentially due to high-channel inventory across the industry.\nAnd while supply availability has improved significantly, constraints persisted in some pockets of the business. Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was down 6% or 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 25% or 21% in constant currency, with FX remaining a significant headwind this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 6-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter, increasing 1 percentage point sequentially. By product category, revenue was down 23% for notebooks, up 1% for desktops and up 9% for workstations.\nWe saw a strong recovery in gaming sequentially with revenue up solid double digits due to better product availability. We have cleared most of our outstanding backlog and finished the quarter at a level consistent with pre-pandemic levels and with most of the remaining backlog reflecting higher value units. Personal Systems delivered $458 million of operating profit with operating margins of 4.5%. We ended the quarter below our long-term range for operating margins, largely as a result of particular weakness in EMEA consumer revenue.\nOperating margin declined 2 points year-over-year due to currency and increased promotional activity given elevated industry channel inventory levels, especially in the consumer business. These headwinds were partially offset by mix, lower commodity costs and variable compensation. We are pleased with the strong execution by the Poly team. They delivered just above breakeven operating profit and exceeded expectations for the quarter.\nIn Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigated the highly dynamic environment. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.5 billion, down 7% nominally or 6% in constant currency, driven by lower supplies revenue and lower home hardware units combined with increased pricing competition in the home business. This was partially offset by higher office hardware units and ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3% driven largely by continued supply constraints for certain IC components and lower consumer demand. We have taken mitigating actions that are beginning to yield improvements in our supply availability at a pace consistent with our plans.\nWhile this has enabled us to make progress on reducing our backlog, we still expect print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23. By customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 1% or 5% in constant currency, with units up 5%. Consumer revenue was down 7% or 4% in constant currency with units down 4%. Office continued with its gradual recovery, while pricing remained disciplined even as supply constraints eased incrementally.\nHome hardware demand softened further sequentially, particularly in the EMEA and Americas regions impacting ASPs as competitive pricing increased during the quarter. In Q4, Commercial recovery remained slow due to the gradual and uneven pace at which the return to office is progressing. There were pockets of strength with Commercial hardware units, up 5%. And in graphics, our Indigo business closed its largest deal to date for 50 digital presses with ePAC, a leader in the flexible packaging market.\nSupplies revenue of $2.7 billion declined just under 10% in constant currency, slightly better than expected as demand weakness appeared to stabilize in the quarter. The decline was driven primarily by continued consumer weakness, particularly in the EMEA region and the slow recovery in the office, partially offset by favorable pricing actions and continued market share gains in ink and toner. Supplies finished FY '22 down nearly 7% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusting for approximate 1-point headwind related to the exit of our Russia business, the year-on-year decline in supplies came in consistent with our original guidance range of a decline of low to mid-single digits. Print operating profit increased $73 million to $903 million, up 9%, yielding an exceptional operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.9 points year-on-year, driven by favorable overall pricing and OpEx management, including lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher commodity costs.\nNow turning to cash flow and capital allocation in Q4. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, exceeding our guidance for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, flat sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was offset by the decrease in days of inventory. In Q4, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders. This included $750 million in share repurchases and $249 million in cash dividends.\nAt the end of FY '22, we successfully finished our transformation plan, generating better-than-expected structural cost savings. Our strong performance and our value plan over the past 3 years, including our capital return and broader capital allocation priorities were made possible in part by the transformation journey we have been on. In 2019, we launched a 3-year plan to unlock significant value and become a leaner, simpler and more digitally enabled company.\nWe took decisive actions aligned to the principles of our value creation plan to become closer to our customers by simplifying our operations and replatforming the company. In total, our transformation program delivered growth annualized run rate savings of over $1.3 billion and reduced our headcount by approximately 7,700 as expected. As part of our simplification journey, we changed our operating model, moving to one commercial organization, and created strong centers of excellence to drive efficiency and faster decision-making.\nIn addition, we optimized our real estate footprint, creating efficient digital workspaces as we transitioned to a hybrid work model. We also made significant progress in optimizing our manufacturing footprint and continuing to enhance resiliency while reducing our cost structure. Digital replatforming was another defining enabler of our transformation efforts. We built a new digital backbone for the company with the deployment of 1 ERP system, creating the ability to deploy additional tools and capabilities.\nIn addition, this new platform provides the foundation upon which we can drive incremental cost savings as well as build new businesses with different business models as we move into FY '23 with the launch of our Future Ready transformation plan. We are now launching cost action efforts as part of that Future Ready program, continuing to the next phase of our transformation. We'll continue to take actions to reduce structural costs across COGS and OpEx to drive efficiencies while protecting the investments necessary to accelerate our transformation, ensuring we are well positioned to drive long-term growth.\nThis program is expected to run for 3 years, and we expect to generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '25. We expect at least 40% of the run rate savings or approximately $560 million to be achieved by the end of FY '23. We have line of sight to these savings, and we also have a good funnel of additional cost savings opportunities that we are betting to help us exceed these targets.\nThe total expected restructuring charge is approximately $1 billion, which includes approximately $200 million in noncash charges in FY '23. We anticipate approximately $600 million of the total charges to be in FY '23 with the rest, split roughly equally in FY '24 and FY '25.\nAs Enrique mentioned, we take workforce reductions very seriously and with the utmost care, but they remain critical to the long-term health of HP. In total, we expect to reduce headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 over the next 3 years. In addition to labor-related restructuring charges of roughly $700 million, we expect additional nonlabor charges related to IT, real estate and other corporate charges.\nWe anticipate the gross savings from this next phase of transformation will partially offset the challenging macro in the near term and incremental investments in growth opportunities we discussed earlier. In summary, these actions will help enable us to build a stronger HP. Looking forward to our Q1 and FY '23 outlook. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities and growth in our end markets, including our key growth areas and our strategy to create value for shareholders over time. Given the current macro environment, we do expect near-term volatility, in particular, keep the following in mind related to Q1 and FY '23 financial outlook.\nGiven the challenging macro environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '23, we see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in the outlook ranges we are providing today. Consistent with our Q4 results and ongoing strategy, we will continue to rigorously manage our OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. This is made possible in part by the decisive cost actions we are announcing today.\nWe expect currency to be about an approximate 5% year-over-year headwind in Q1 and 5% for FY '23 reflecting the current strength of the U.S. dollar. In Personal Systems, we expect the overall PC market to see an approximate 10-point unit decline versus FY '22. Many of the recent challenges we have seen in FY '22 will likely continue into FY '23, including softer demand in both consumer and commercial and higher channel inventory levels across the industry.\nWe anticipate these factors will put continued pressure on overall pricing at least through the first half of '23. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to improve as we focus on higher-value categories, including commercial premium and hybrid work solutions. We expect Personal Systems margins to be below the low end of our 5% to 7% target range through at least the first half of FY '23 driven by the high normalization of industry channel inventory levels. And then improve into the second half as channel inventory normalizes and our transformation-related cost actions start to more meaningfully impact our cost structure. And regarding Q1 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be down mid-single digits sequentially.\nIn Print, in terms of the overall print market sizing, we expect it to be down approximately 3% year-on-year driven by the challenging macro environment and slower-than-expected return to the office. In the office market, we continue to expect the market sizing to be approximately 80% of our pre-pandemic projections. In home, we expect the market to be down in '23 versus the exceptional performance during COVID, but still above our pre-pandemic projections.\nWe expect continued softness in consumer demand and favorable pricing in commercial units, offsetting some normalization in consumer pricing, particularly in the first half of '23. In terms of our print hardware supply chain, we expect constraints strengths to continue, particularly in office hardware, at least through first half of FY '23. We expect Print margins for FY '23 to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range, driven by the resiliency of our portfolio and disciplined pricing and cost management including our transformation efforts to reduce our print fixed cost structure, as Enrique mentioned.\nAnd finally, regarding supplies revenue, we expect to decline low to mid-single digits in FY '23 in constant currency, consistent with our long-term outlook. For FY '23, we expect to be within that range in aggregate. But for the first half of '23, we expect to be at similar levels to Q4 given the macro environment and tough compares.\nWe expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash charges.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first, largely consistent with our net earnings combined with the fact that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of prior year variable comp. Furthermore, normal, quarterly sequential seasonality does not apply for FY '23, given the dynamic macro environment. But we do expect some improvement in our revenue trajectory in the second half of '23. That said, we expect our key growth businesses collectively will continue to grow double digits organically in FY '23 as we continue to invest in innovation and adjacent market opportunities.\nWith regard to OpEx, we expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure as part of our transformation, particularly in our core businesses, where we expect OpEx to be down year-on-year However, including Poly, we do expect total OpEx to be up year-on-year. In addition, for FY '23, we expect OI&E expense will be approximately $0.5 billion, consistent with our Q4 exit run rate.\nMoving to capital allocation. We are not making any changes to our capital return framework. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to our strategy of returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x, and there aren't any better return opportunities in order to maintain our credit rating.\nGiven the challenging current environment, consistent with our disciplined financial management, we expect share repurchases will be modest near term based on our FY '23 outlook today. Lastly, we announced today that we are raising our annual dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share, reflecting confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. We have raised our dividend every year since separation in late 2015.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook -- We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.57. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.60. And FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.62.\nFor FY '23, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which is net of about $400 million in restructuring cash outflows.\nBefore we open for Q&A, I want to leave you with the following thoughts. First, as part of our Future Ready plan, we are taking clear and decisive actions, which includes aggressive structural cost reductions as we have just shared.\nSecond, we are adapting to these challenging market conditions with our Future Ready cost transformation program, which includes plans to drive significant cost savings. Third, we're confident in the long-term growth opportunities and are capitalizing on these opportunities by investing to become a more digital company with a more growth-oriented portfolio.\nFourth, we have an experienced management team with a proven track record in up and down markets. We deliver on our financial commitments. We are disciplined in our capital allocation and committed to a strong balance sheet. In short, we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value creation. We are building a stronger HP, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you at FY '23.\nOperator, please open the line so we can take your questions.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of IR, HP Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.\nAs always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.\nWe also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, and HP's other SEC filings.\nDuring this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Enrique.\n\nEnrique J. Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Orit, and thanks to everyone who is joining the call today. As part of our earnings today, we will cover 3 important themes. First, we will talk about the unexpected and very abrupt shift in the macroeconomic environment and how this is challenging our overall business in the short term. Second, we will enumerate the decisive actions we are taking in response to this macroeconomic challenge, including continued progress in our structural cost reduction programs while we continue prioritizing our investments in growth areas. Third, we will convey that our confidence in the medium- and longer-term prospects of our markets and growth drivers remains intact. We are firmly committed to our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term and disciplined capital return to shareholders.\nFirst, regarding the macroeconomic environment, like many companies, we are managing through some challenging market conditions with a focus on what we can control. Inflation increased in many parts of the world, and this led to lower consumer spending for our product categories. And demand in Europe worsened against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war. Although we highlighted pockets of consumer softness during our Q2 call, the environment deteriorated more rapidly late in the third quarter.\nThe strength of our commercial business, particularly in the enterprise, helped us to partially offset declines in consumer demand. Still, the fact that we remain supply constrained did not allow us to fully rebalance. As a result, our net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency year-over-year. Despite this, we were still able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 in line with our previously provided outlook. This reflects our very disciplined cost management and pricing strategy as well as our continued ability to shift more of our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-value segments.\nAnd while we cannot control how the economic situation evolves in the coming months, there are some very clear actions we can take to mitigate the impact of near-term headwinds and drive continued progress against our long-term growth strategy. And we are taking a very measured approach with a focus on 5 clear priorities: First, we are optimizing our performance by staying disciplined in our pricing and increasing our focus on pockets of profitable growth, such as premium, peripherals, services and solutions. Second, given volatility is becoming the norm, we are focused on continuously improving the way we respond to it. We are taking decisive actions to address issues that have surfaced due to the abrupt changes we have seen in the industry. And we view this as an opportunity to further improve our ability to adapt to quick transitions in the market in the future.\nThird, we are doubling down on our growth portfolio while protecting our core business. Collectively, our key growth businesses once again grew double digits in Q3. And we remain on track to exceed our $10 billion revenue target for the full year. We expect our key growth businesses will continue to be a critical part of our growth strategy. Fourth, we are taking actions to reduce our variable spend and further reduce our structural cost by accelerating our digital transformation.\nWe have already met or exceeded many of our objectives in our current transformation plan. And we're in the process of finalizing the foundation for a new multiyear transformation program that we plan to share with you during our Q4 call. And finally, we are maintaining our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders, and we expect to exceed our commitment to return $16 billion to shareholders as part of our value creation plan. These are the right areas of focus regardless of the macro environment. In times like this, they become even more important, and the actions we are taking will enable us to continue building a stronger HP.\nLet me now spend a few minutes discussing our Q3 business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue declined 3%, primarily driven by softening consumer demand for our categories and more price competition. In constant currency, PS revenue was flat in the quarter. We delivered operating profit margin of 6.9%. This is at the high end of our target range, driven by disciplined pricing and our mix shift to high-value segments and robust cost management.\nWithin commercial, our Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18% with commercial premium and workstations up double digits. And commercial was more than 2/3 of our PS revenue mix in Q3. We are taking actions to optimize consumer performance, and we are focusing on pockets of growth across our portfolio, such as premium and peripheral, which grew double digits this quarter. We saw overall higher channel inventory levels in the quarter, and we expect pricing will become more aggressive in Q4 to address this.\nWhile this environment creates some near-term market uncertainty, our long-term view of the PC market and its adjacencies has not changed. And we have confidence in the trajectory of Personal Systems over time. One source of our confidence is our acquisition of Poly, which we closed yesterday. We are thrilled to welcome the Poly team to HP. Poly accelerates our expansion and scale in 2 key growth businesses, peripheral and workforce solutions.\nPoly devices and software, combined with HP's leadership across compute, device management and security creates a comprehensive portfolio of highly work solutions. We continue to receive very positive feedback from resellers, partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. We expect the transaction will be accretive to non-GAAP EPS and in fiscal year '23. With the Poly deal completed, I am pleased to share that Dave Shull, Poly's former CEO, will be joining HP to lead a newly created workforce services and solutions organization.\nThis is a big step forward for our business that will allow us to drive a more integrated and expansive commercial services growth agenda across Personal Systems and Print. Dave is a terrific executive with extensive global experience, and he will be a great addition to our leadership team.\nLet me now turn to our Print business. Like PS, consumer softness and supply constraints weighed on our results. Specifically, Print revenue declined 6% or 5% in constant currency, with supply revenue declining 9%. We delivered operating profit margin of 19.9%, which is well above our target range and reflects our disciplined pricing and cost management in a tough market as well as commercial hardware supply constraints.\nWe also made progress against our plans to rebalance system profitability and accelerate in key growth areas. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing more than 50% of printer shipments in the quarter. And our focus on Big Tank in emerging markets allowed us to gain share. We delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue and cumulative subscriber growth in our consumer subscription business. This model is proving to be resilient, and its value proposition is even more attractive to consumers in this environment.\nIndustrial graphics impressions also grew year-over-year, and we built a strong funnel with recovery in all segments. And we delivered double-digit revenue growth in as customers increase their deployment of our thermoplastic solutions. Across both Personal Systems and Print, we continue to drive an aggressive innovation agenda. Last week, we kicked off a global roadshow with our top channel partners. And I will tell you what I told them. We have built our strongest portfolio ever. We have introduced more than 100 new products and solutions over the past 18 months. Much of this innovation is being driven by the rise of the hybrid office. Our devices are what's enabling people to connect, create and collaborate across multiple locations and do it securely.\nLast week, we introduced our HP Instant Ink for small business and our new LaserJet Pro with HP+. This is an intuitive printing system that's tailor-made to meet the unique needs of small businesses by enabling greater productivity, effortless device management and advanced security. And in Personal Systems, we just unveiled our next-gen Dragonfly Folio, a beautiful PC that has been thoughtfully crafted for hybrid work. Enhanced by our HP Presence video conferencing solution, the Dragonfly's advanced camera capabilities, automatic voice leveling and background noise filtering technologies and digital temp create a superb remote work experience. The Dragonfly is also made using ocean-bound plastic and other recycled materials, which supports our overall commitment to sustainable impact.\nWe continue to advance our efforts in this area. We announced last week a significant expansion of our HP Amplify Impact program, which mobilizes and rewards our channel partners as they make progress on their own sustainability and diversity goals. This work is differentiating our brand, motivating our people and strengthening our communities.\nLooking ahead, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. Consumer softness is likely to continue in the near term. We also see some companies taking a more measured approach to their spending and new orders showing signs of softening demand in commercial categories. And although we have made significant progress on supply chain, some shortages remain. Given that we do not currently foresee an economic rebound in the short term, we believe the prudent thing to do is to adjust our Q4 outlook, which Marie will discuss in her remarks.\nBut like all economic downturns, we also believe that the current situation is temporary. And just as market conditions deteriorated quickly, they could also rebound quickly. We have consistently proven our ability to manage the company through up and down markets. We are prepared for multiple scenarios and ready to act as needed. Most importantly, the fundamentals from which our long-term strategy is built have not changed. Hybrid work is here to stay. Gaming will continue to grow in popularity. The rise of digital services and subscriptions is unlocking new business models. And industrial markets are being disrupted by new technologies.\nThese are long-term secular trends. Each of them plays to HP's strength. And we are confident in our long-term growth targets even as we take the actions necessary to mitigate near-term headwinds. To give you additional insight into our performance and outlook, I'm going to pass it over to Marie.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Enrique mentioned, our Q3 results were impacted by macroeconomic challenges, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand in our categories: inflation, currency and geopolitical challenges. We took swift actions across the levers within our control to help address these headwinds, focusing on rigorous financial management in both our costs and our investments across our businesses.\nIn addition, we are executing on our strategy and returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Disciplined financial management, particularly OpEx and cost management, is core to our DNA at HP, and we are confident in our ability to navigate adeptly in up and down market conditions. Furthermore, we continue to realize structural cost savings from our transformation program and see additional opportunities to drive significant cost reductions ahead of us. Despite these recent challenges, we remain confident in both our end markets and strategy to drive the long-term value creation opportunities we see ahead of us.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency. Approximately 2 points or half of the decline was due to the change in estimated sales and marketing incentives benefit in our prior year results. Gross margin was 19.8% in the quarter, down 2.4 points year-on-year, driven by the change in estimated incentives benefit in the prior year and currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion or 10.3% of revenue, down 20% year-on-year. In Q3, we installed further rigor in our cost management. We reduced our OpEx spend by over $370 million year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter by prioritizing our variable spend in R&D and marketing aligned with our growth categories.\nLower variable compensation given the more challenging business environment was also a key driver. At the same time, we are making prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas which I will touch upon in a few moments.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, down 8%, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $104 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $1.04 with a diluted share count of approximately $1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $40 million, primarily related to nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and Russia exit charges. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.08.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.1 billion, down 3% and flat in constant currency. Total units were down 25% as a result of a decline in chrome demand as well as the rapid deterioration of demand late in the quarter, particularly in our consumer business. In addition, we continue to see ongoing supply chain constraints as expected in some pockets of PS. In spite of those challenges, there were several bright spots in the quarter. We saw solid demand in our higher-value categories across commercial and consumer, consistent with our strategy. Commercial revenue constituted over 2/3 of our Personal Systems revenue in Q3, and our commercials Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18%, with units up 6%.\nMobile workstation revenue was up approximately 60%. Consumer premium revenue was up 10%. The long-term secular tailwinds we continue to see in Personal Systems, including hybrid work, give us confidence in our long-term outlook. And regarding hybrid work, an area of focus, I want to give a warm welcome to our Poly team. We anticipate significant opportunity ahead from both a strategic and financial perspective, with clear opportunities to capitalize on both secular tailwinds and synergies to help drive long-term revenue and non-GAAP operating profit and EPS growth. I will cover the financial impact of Poly shortly.\nLet's drill into the details. Commercial revenue was up 7% year-on-year and up 11% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 20% year-on-year and down 18% in constant currency. FX was clearly a key factor in our results this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 5-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter. By product category, revenue was down 10% for notebooks, up 13% for desktops and up 38% for workstations. We also continued to perform well in many of our key growth areas, including peripherals and DaaS, which was up strong double digits.\nPersonal Systems delivered $695 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%, flat sequentially as we continue to execute despite the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Operating margin declined 1.5 points year-on-year primarily due to currency and higher costs particularly in consumer, partially offset by lower OpEx, including lower R&D and variable compensation and improved commercial product mix.\nIn Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 6% nominally and down 5% in constant currency, driven by lower supplies revenue and lower print hardware units. This was partially offset by higher home and office hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected IC component availability and logistics constraints.\nWhile we have qualified additional suppliers and our Board redesigns are on track for product inclusion later this year, we still expect Print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23. By customer segment, commercial revenue declined 3% and down 1% in constant currency on unit declines of 15%. Consumer revenue was up 1% and 3% in constant currency with units down 1%. However, we saw some softening in home hardware demand sequentially, particularly on low-end units, impacting ASPs driven by the headwinds I described earlier.\nIn Q3, commercial recovery continued to be impacted by the slow return to the office. In contrast, we did see solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D. In graphics, our flexible packaging business had another solid quarter and impressions have more than doubled versus pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM over time based on our current outlook.\nSupplies revenue of $2.8 billion declined 9% in constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by a significant reduction in consumer demand, driven by the challenging environment and continued normalization in home printing, partially offset by the gradual recovery in industrial print. The estimated impact of our decision to stop and permanently wind down our Russia business was approximately 1 point headwind to our supplies revenue year-on-year. Instant Ink services delivered another quarter of double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue, continuing to highlight the success of this business model even in a tougher macro. Print operating profit was $911 million, up 6%, yielding an operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.3 points, driven by rate improvement in hardware and OpEx management particularly lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix.\nNow let's move to our transformation efforts, where we had another strong quarter of progress and are on track to exceed our $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by fiscal year end. During Q3, we delivered on numerous fronts, driving cost reductions to help drive long-term value creation. In Q3, we took several actions to drive structural cost reductions across both our manufacturing and real estate footprint. We executed 2 significant actions intended to optimize our factory footprint, driving both efficiency and increased global resiliency across our ink and laser hardware and supplies manufacturing.\nIn addition, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint with site exits or reductions. Year-to-date, we have now executed 23 site optimizations, including 8 site exits, and our overall plan has now reached 90 site optimizations since the start of our transformation. Our efforts have established a strong foundation that we fully intend to build upon going forward. As Enrique mentioned, we are currently finalizing our next phase of digital transformation focused on further cost and efficiency opportunities and plan to provide an update during our Q4 earnings call.\nNow let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, a sequential improvement of 3 days. Free cash flow and the sequential improvement in the cash conversion days came in below our expectations, driven primarily by the larger-than-expected sequential decrease in Personal Systems volume, delays in supply availability and unfavorable manufacturing linearity. And while we saw a meaningful improvement in our days of inventory in Personal Systems driven primarily by a decrease in commodities, these benefits were more than offset by higher days of Print inventory largely from assurance of supply and increased lead times.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we expect to see further improvement to our cash conversion cycle. Driving our outlook are our expectations for additional operational improvements, including further reductions to inventory levels, and we also expect some improvement in Personal Systems volume sequentially in Q4. Strong capital returns continue to be a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $255 million in cash dividends. Since the start of our value plan, we have returned over $15.6 billion to shareholders and remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by fiscal year end while also maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating. In Q4, we expect to continue to be active in our shares.\nLooking forward to Q4 and our fiscal year end, we continue to navigate the challenging macro and demand environment, including inflation, logistics constraints and pricing dynamics. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q4 and overall financial outlook. Given the changing demand environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling several scenarios based on a range of assumptions. For FY '22, we now see a wider range of outcomes. And as a result, we are lowering our overall outlook for FY '22.\nWe expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure and OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. We expect currency to be approximately 3 percentage points year-over-year headwind in Q4 and about 1.5 percentage points for FY '22, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For Personal Systems, we expect many of the trends we saw in Q3 to continue, including softer demand in both consumer and commercial. We anticipate these factors will put some sequential pressure on overall pricing. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial premium and peripherals.\nWith regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, we expect availability and most of our key components to improve with pockets of semiconductors to remain constrained into FY '23. We expect Personal Systems margins to be in the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range in Q4. And regarding Q4 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be up slightly sequentially. Regarding Poly and our results, they will only reflect the last 2 months of the quarter, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in FY '23.\nIn Print, we expect further softening in demand in consumer similar to what we saw in the latter part of Q3. Favorable pricing in higher-end consumer and commercial units and further normalization and mix as we expect commercial to gradually improve over time. With regard to Print supply chain, we expect, similar to Q3, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain hardware revenue in some areas. We expect these conditions to continue into FY '23, but with some incremental improvement in Q4. We now expect Print margins for Q4 specifically to once again be above the high end of our range, given continued hardware constraints and disciplined cost management.\nAnd finally, regarding supplies revenue, we are holding to our long-term outlook of a low- to mid-single-digit annual decline in constant currency. In the near term, over the next few quarters, we expect to see a decline of roughly low double digits, given the challenging environment. And as a result, we expect to be above our long-term range for FY '22.\nWith regard to the impact of Poly on our financials in the fourth quarter and for FY '22, we expect a non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and approximately $0.05 headwind from Poly, including debt-related expenses and other deal-related costs. And for our GAAP diluted net earnings per share, we expect an incremental approximately $0.27 GAAP-only charge related to the Poly acquisition charges. And regarding free cash flow, we expected approximately $300 million cash flow headwind related to Poly acquisition and integration costs.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. Fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.54.\nWe expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.12. And FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.88. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.56.\nFor FY '22, we now expect free cash flow for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. For HP with Poly, we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to make progress against our priorities as we navigate through a very volatile fiscal 2022. And we are taking decisive actions with the levers within our control. Looking forward, we plan to provide guidance for FY '23 as part of our Q4 earnings call.\nTypically, we would provide guidance as part of our Annual Analyst Day or Security Analyst Meeting event. Moving forward, we plan to have these Analyst Day events biannually or as we have key updates to our strategy. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. I'll stop here so we can take your questions.",

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nOrit Keinan-Nahon\n\nVP of Finance & Head of IR, HP Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.\nAs always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThanks, Orit. And thank you to everyone joining our call today. We are now halfway for our 2022 fiscal year, and I am proud of the results our teams have delivered as we continue building a stronger HP.\nBut before I talk about our performance, I want to acknowledge the tragic events of the past few weeks. Last Tuesday, 19 children and 2 of their teachers were sensitively killed at a Texas elementary school. About a week earlier, 10 people were killed in a racially motivated attack in Buffalo. These horrific events and others like them are deeply disturbing and our hearts are with the communities who are bearing unimaginable loss right now.\nAt the same time, we're also thinking about the people of Ukraine. More than 3 months into the war with Russia, the devastation and suffering across Ukraine is difficult to comprehend. So too is the situation facing the 6 million Ukrainian refugees. We continue to mobilize resources to support them. The HP Foundation has provided additional funding to support humanitarian relief across Central Europe. And we are donating a significant number of PCs to help refugees and their families, consistent with our global efforts to promote digital equity and education.\nTimes like this are a painful reminder of how much work is still needed to create a more just future. And I believe it's incumbent upon companies to lead with purpose. These values have long been core to HP brand, and they will continue to guide us.\nLet me now turn to our results. When we held our Investor Day last October, I discussed our plans to continue our push to advance our leadership in our core markets, while creating a more growth-oriented portfolio by expanding its adjacencies and creating new businesses. I also highlighted the long-term secular trends we see propelling us forward, especially the rise of hybrid work and the exciting opportunities it creates across our broad portfolio.\nOur second quarter results show strong momentum in each of these areas. In the face of a volatile and dynamic macro environment, we executed well and grew revenue and non-GAAP EPS while returning capital to our shareholders. We are delivering on our commitment, and our business is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.\nFor the quarter, revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $16.5 billion as we continue to see strong demand for HP technology and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew 16% year-over-year to $1.08. That's at the high end of our previously provided outlook. We generated $0.4 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWe remain committed to building a more growth-oriented portfolio. Our key growth businesses, which includes gaming, peripherals, instant ink, workforce solutions and industrial graphics and 3D collectively grew double digits and delivered total revenue of $5.6 billion in the first half of fiscal '22. And we are well on track to deliver on our $10 billion full year revenue target that we announced last October. We feel very good about these results.\nWe mitigated the impact of higher commodity costs by implementing effective pricing strategies in both print and personal systems while maintaining strong demand. And as we navigate the macro environment, we are making consistent progress on our strategic priorities and bringing strong innovation to market.\nThis is reflected in our business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 9% to $11.5 billion. This was our highest Q2 revenue ever, reflecting the durability of PC demand. We also delivered operating profit margin of 6.9%, at the high end of our target range. We are managing our PS portfolio with great discipline, focused on driving profitable revenue growth more than units.\nOur continued mix shift towards commercial and premium combined with our pricing strategy allowed us to more than offset fewer unit shipments in the quarter. Increased spending on hybrid work solutions is driving strong commercial PC demand. Commercial revenue grew 18%, driven by double-digit growth in Windows-based notebooks, desktops and workstations. And commercial was trending up to 65% of our peer revenue mix in the quarter.\nIn Consumer, while the market has seen some signs of softening demand, it still exceeded pre-pandemic levels. There are pockets of growth in areas like premium and gaming that we are most focused on. And we are driving continued growth in peripherals, which grew more than 40% this quarter.\nOur supply chain actions also continue to have a positive impact. We reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter. While the backlog remains elevated, particularly in commercial, we believe the actions we are taking will drive continued improvement. And as we prioritize operational execution, we are equally focused on strengthening our portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire Poly. Once completed, we expect this transaction will strengthen our position in hybrid work solutions and accelerate our growth in peripherals and workforce solutions. Since the announcement was made, we have received very positive feedback from reseller partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. Our integration planning efforts are well underway. And we are working closely with the Poly team to prepare for a smooth transition upon deal close. We look forward to welcoming the Poly team to HP later this year.\nTurning to Print. We continue to operate in our components and logistics constrained environment, and performance was also impacted by the macro events this quarter. As a result, Print revenue declined 7% in the quarter, and our order backlog remained elevated in Q2. We expect supply chain dynamics to improve but continued shortages, especially in application-specific integrated circuit will impact Print for the remainder of the year.\nWe are actively working with our partners to mitigate the risks by executing on dual sourcing whenever possible and redesigning safety boards and components in our printers. We are also managing prices with great discipline, and we delivered another quarter of solid profitability. Our Print operating profit margin was 19.3%, our second consecutive quarter above our target range. Print consumer demand remained solid despite some softening in Europe.\nAnd we made important progress on 2 strategic objectives: rebalancing system profitability and growing our subscription business. We have seen strong acceleration with HP+ and increased adoption in developed markets since launching last spring. In addition, we see strong growth on our profit upfront units including our Big Tank model, especially in emerging markets.\nBig Tank revenue and units grew double digits year-over-year. We plan to continue expanding the Big tank portfolio with new product launches of high-end platforms in the rest of our markets. Overall, HP+ and Big Tank printers have become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing 48% of printer shipments in the quarter.\nIn consumer subscriptions, Instant Ink delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue and cumulative subscribers. In commercial print, the office segment continued to be impacted by supply availability as well as uncertainty around the timing of offices reopening. This was partially offset by our industrial graphics and 3D businesses growth.\nIn Industrial Graphics, we delivered solid revenue growth and build a strong funnel, continuing the positive trajectory we have seen in recent quarters. We had significant new installations of our latest Indigo digital presence. And I am particularly proud of the team's work for our customer Hershey as we created customized packaging to support their International Women's month campaign.\nWe also delivered double-digit revenue growth in 3D printing. This quarter, we announced a partnership with Legor Group, a leader in metal science and production for the luxury jewelry and fashion accessories market. This is an important milestone as we prepare to make metal yet more broadly available later this year.\nThe progress we made in our first half of 2022 gives us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook. And as we enter the second half, we will remain focused on disciplined execution in today's challenging and volatile macro environment.\nFrom a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong commercial demand with some softening of the consumer businesses. From a supply perspective, we see 2 quarters of constraints. First is the industry-wide component shortages that we expect will continue through fiscal '22. Second are the COVID-related disruptions in China, which we expect will primarily impact fiscal Q3.\nWe will also see an impact from the Russia-Ukraine war. Last February, we suspended shipments to Russia and Belarus across our portfolio and paused all marketing and advertising activities. Considering the COVID environment and long-term outlook for Russia, we have decided to stop our Russia activity and have begun the process of fully winding down our operations. Business there accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2021. Marie will talk more about the financial aspects of our Russia plants.\nWe remain committed to taking structural costs out of the business, and we are on track to meet our transformation cost targets. These actions, combined with top line growth and effective working capital management give us confidence in achieving our free cash flow target. And we remain committed to our share repurchase plan of at least $4 billion in fiscal year 2022.\nThe final point I'd like to make is that we are delivering on our financial commitments while making progress against our sustainable impact strategy. Later this week, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining progress against climate action, human rights and digital equity goals.\nLet me give you a few examples. From 2019 to 2021, we achieved a 9% absolute reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions across HP's value chain. I am proud that we continue to decrease absolute emissions while our net revenue increased by 8% during the same period.\nWe have reduced single-use plastic packaging by 44% compared to 2018. And we have enabled better learning outcomes for over 74 million people globally since 2015 by providing curriculum training and technology. I am inspired by the progress we are making towards becoming the world's most sustainable and just technology company. Not only are these the right things to do, they are also differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business.\nTo sum up, this quarter caps off a strong first half of 2022. We are building a more growth-oriented portfolio, while also operating with great discipline and agility in the face of macro challenges. The environment will remain dynamic in the second half. We are not immune to these challenges, but our strong performance and momentum through the first 2 quarters gives us confidence to increase our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook.\nWe are equally confident in our free cash flow outlook for the year, and we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and continuing to return capital to shareholders while investing in the business to build a stronger HP.\nI will stop here and let Marie provide a closer look into our financials and outlook.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to connect with you again. As Enrique highlighted, we have continued to build on our progress here in Q2, executing on our strategy, delivering solid results, returning significant capital to shareholders and investing both organically and inorganically to drive long-term value creation.\nOverall demand remained solid, driven by the strong secular tailwinds we see propelling our businesses forward, and we continue to execute on our objectives despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and new macro impacts from the recent round of COVID-related lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war. Overall, I am pleased with how our teams are meeting these challenges head on and remain confident in our execution as we navigate this evolving macro environment.\nLet's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $16.5 billion in the quarter, up 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 1%, EMEA increased 7% and APJ increased 10%. Gross margin was 20.2% in the quarter, down 1.5 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by proportionally higher Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities, partially offset by favorable pricing net of currency.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, down 5%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by lower R&D due to last year's ramp up in investments and lower variable compensation, including sales commissions.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $74 million for the quarter. At the key segment level, operating profit grew 6%. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.15 or 16% to $1.08 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $152 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.94.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $11.5 billion, up 9% and up 11% in constant currency. Total units were down 17%, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, lower Chrome units and the overall macro environment. Despite this, we grew revenue, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, our mix shift towards higher-value commercial categories like mainstream premium and mobile workstation, and favorable pricing. Furthermore, to highlight some of the secular tailwinds we have seen in Personal Systems versus pre-pandemic, our commercial notebook mix, excluding Chrome, now represents over 60% of our commercial unit mix, up 15 points versus Q2 2019.\nAnd in gaming, revenue has grown by over 140% versus Q2 2019. These are significant structural changes in our business. Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was up 18% year-on-year and Consumer revenue was down 6% year-on-year. By product category, revenue was up 3% for notebooks, 28% for desktops and 21% for workstations. We also continue to see strong performance across our key growth areas, including peripherals, gaming and workforce solutions, with even more opportunities to drive growth ahead of us.\nPersonal Systems delivered almost $800 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%. Our Personal Systems business has grown operating profit dollars in 17 of the last 18 quarters. This consistent performance is indicative of our strong portfolio, the strong secular tailwinds we continue to see and our ability to deliver results in very different environments.\nOperating margin improved 0.2 points, primarily due to product mix, favorable pricing and lower OpEx, including lower R&D spend due to last year's investments ramp up, partially offset by higher commodity costs in currency. Sequentially, operating margin declined 0.9 points, driven by higher OpEx due to R&D investment, more competitive pricing in several segments of consumer, partially offset by lower commodity and logistics costs.\nIn Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q2, total Print revenue was $5 billion, down 7% and down 6% in constant currency, driven by lower Print hardware units and lower Supplies revenue. This was partially offset by higher hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 23%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend at least through 2022.\nBy customer segment, Commercial revenue declined 4% on a decrease of 17% in units and Consumer revenue was down 12% with units down 24%. Home product demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by available supply.\nIn Q2, the commercial recovery, particularly in the Office segment, continued to be impacted by the slower-than-expected return to the office. We did see, however, solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D, as Enrique mentioned. We continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in Commercial over time, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM, as we have discussed previously.\nSupplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 6% in constant currency year-on-year. We continue to expect for FY '22 and over the long term, Supplies will decline in the mid- to low single-digit range, consistent with the outlook provided at our Analyst Day. In Q2, the decline was driven primarily by continued normalization in home printing, as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in both office and industrial print.\nSupplies revenue was also impacted by the China lockdowns and the Russia-Ukraine war. Adjusting for these impacts, supplies revenue was down approximately 4% in constant currency. As part of our contractual business, our Instant Ink services continued its momentum, once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue while monthly churn continues to remain low at approximately 1%.\nOperating profit was approximately $1 billion, up $7 million and operating margin was strong at 19.3%. Operating margin increased 1.4 points, driven by favorable mix and pricing, combined with lower OpEx as a result of lower variable compensation, including sales commissions, partially offset by lower volumes.\nNow let's move to our transformation efforts where we have made strong progress and are on track to deliver $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by year-end. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. For our sales teams and partners, we have accelerated the selling cycle by transforming the way we configure price and quote HP solutions for our customers worldwide.\nUtilizing advanced analytical pricing capabilities with a cloud-based platform, we have enabled the delivery of competitive quotes for HP solutions in 1/4 of the time, delivering a faster and more efficient customer sales experience. Lastly, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint, including 15 real estate actions in the first half of 2022. We are rebuilding and modernizing our key locations, focusing on collaboration hybrid work for our employees.\nA great example of this is our accelerated actions in Korea to both consolidate our sites and open a new state-of-the-art office and R&D facility, bringing together most of our employees in Korea.\nNow let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter, a sequential decline of 7 days. So free cash flow and the sequential decline in cash conversion days were driven primarily by the decrease in Personal Systems volume and back-end loaded revenue linearity driven by supply chain delays.\nLooking ahead to the second half of 2022, we expect to improve our cash conversion cycle by fiscal year-end. Driving our outlook is our expectations for Personal Systems volumes to recover in Q4, which I will provide more color on in a moment and other operational improvements in our cash conversion cycle, including reduced inventory.\nAs a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow guidance of at least $4.5 billion for 2022. Strong capital returns remain a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q2, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $262 million in cash dividends, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by year-end.\nLooking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY '22, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, inflation, pricing dynamics and the evolving macro environment while continuing to deliver on our commitments. In particular, [kept up], following in line related to our Q3 and overall financial outlook.\nWe are once again raising our full year non-GAAP outlook for FY '22 as we navigate through a challenging macro environment. We expect currency to be about a 2% year-over-year headwind in both Q3 and for FY '22, reflecting the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.\nWith regard to the financial impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent lockdowns in China, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that conditions remain fluid and highly uncertain with impacts to our top and bottom line results. Regarding Russia, as Enrique mentioned, we have made the decision to stop our activity there and have begun the process of fully winding down our operations. At FY '21, Russia accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue.\nIn China, we expect to see a reopening and easing of restrictions from the recent lockdowns beginning in June. For Personal Systems, we continue to see solid demand and pricing for our PCs in commercial with some softening of demand in consumer, driven in part by the macro factors I mentioned earlier, including currency. We expect year-over-year Personal Systems revenue growth through the second half of 2022 with a continued shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals.\nWith regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, while we expect to see a gradual improvement in the supply environment, we did experience a supplier-specific disruption late in Q2 that we expect will resolve by the end of Q3, resulting in a sequential decline in Personal Systems revenue in Q3 and a rebound in Q4, more in keeping with typical seasonality. We expect PS margins to remain near the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q3.\nIn Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022. With regard to print supply chain, we expect similar to Q2, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these conditions to continue at least through 2022, but with some improvement into the latter part of the year. We expect group margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY '22. For Q3, specifically, given continued hard work constraints, we expect Print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.08. And third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.96, which includes an incremental GAAP-only charge of approximately $0.04 related to the wind down of operations in Russia.\nWe expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.38 and FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.93. For FY '22, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion.\nWe have made excellent progress against our priorities in the first half of fiscal 2022. And I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our second half outlook while investing for long-term sustainable growth.\nI'll stop here so we can take your questions.",

Lores\n\nCEO, President & Director, HP Inc.\n\nThanks, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to briefly address the unfolding situation in Ukraine. The well-being of our people, their families and our customers and partners is our top concern. We are doing everything we can to keep them safe. We want nothing more than to see peace and stability restored to the region. We have an experienced cross-functional team in place focused on business continuity. The environment is very fluid and we are preparing for a range of scenarios.\nAnd in the meantime, in compliance with administration's recently approved sanctions, we have suspended shipments to Russia. The difficult situation in Ukraine is the latest in a series of global challenges we have faced. Time and again, our team has shown remarkable agility and determination, and I have great confidence in their ability to manage these situations.\nWhen we were last together at the end of 2021, I talked about our strategy to modernize our core, expand into valuable adjacencies and build a more growth-oriented portfolio. And our first quarter results show the progress we are making against this plan. We continue to see very strong demand, driven in large part by the secular tailwinds associated with hybrid. The way people work and live have fundamentally changed, and we see this trend continuing across our segments long past the pandemic. This creates incredible opportunities for innovation and growth.\nCompanies are reconfiguring office space to be more collaborative, and this is requiring a refresh in their IT strategies, services and security offerings. Consumers are investing to improve their home office setups as hybrid work becomes the norm. And when they are not working, people are looking for more immersive entertainment experience with improved video, audio and battery performance.\nUnderlying all these is a growing desire from both consumers and commercial customers to buy from companies with well-developed ESG goals. Each of these trends play to our strength and they drove our Q1 results. We grew revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow, continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding our commitments.\nLet me walk through the details. For the quarter, revenue grew 9% to $17 billion. This is our highest-ever quarterly revenue since separation, driven by demand for our products and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew more than twice as fast as revenue, up 20% to $1.10, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow while returning 127% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nOur results were particularly strong in the key growth areas that I outlined last year. Collectively, these businesses grew double digits this quarter. This includes more than 20% growth in gaming, more than 40% growth in peripheral and 20% growth for our industrial graphics and 3D portfolio. We are bullish in our opportunities in this area, and we expect them to become a larger part of our overall revenue and profit mix moving forward.\nWe delivered while continuing to navigate a complex environment of industry-wide component shortages and logistical constraints. Despite steady progress against our plans to strengthen our operational processes, it will take time before the gap between supply and demand fully dissipates. We are securing more parts for products, sourcing from alternate part suppliers and allocating available parts to optimize our product mix. This is an area of relentless focus for our team.\nLet me now talk about the progress we see across each of our business units. In Personal Systems, it was a record quarter with our highest revenue and operating profit since separation. Revenue grew 15% to more than $12 billion. We delivered OP rate above the high end of our target range, and our disciplined execution and pricing strategy enabled us to manage cost and component headwinds. A big contributor to our success is the improved mix we are driving. Our leadership in the commercial PC market is a significant competitive advantage as more and more offices reopen.\nThis is where we saw the most demand and highest profitability. Within commercial, we saw strong growth in Windows-based notebooks and mobile workstations, where our share expanded this quarter. In consumer, we continue to experience demand shift into high-value categories like premium and gaming. We also reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter and our supply chain actions are generating positive results. And as we prioritize operational execution, we continue to innovate at the heart of hybrid.\nLast month, we had our biggest Consumer Electronics Show ever, launching nearly 50 new innovations that are changing the way people collaborate, create and play. This included a major expansion of our portfolio of HP Presence-enabled devices as we strengthen our position in the large and growing video conferencing market. We also launched our latest gaming solutions and peripherals, including a new HyperX wireless headset that can last 300 hours on a single charge.\nTurning to Print, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain challenges. As a result of component shortages and logistics exceptions, revenue declined 4% in the quarter and our elevated order backlog increased sequentially. We now expect these dynamics to impact Print throughout March of fiscal year '22. We are driving a very disciplined pricing and allocation strategy across Print, and our operating profit rate of 18.2% was above the high end of our target range.\nWe are also making good progress against our long-term priorities. We continue to modernize core Print and drive HP+ global adoption. HP+ is a big selling point of our new ENVY Inspire lineup, which we successfully launched in the U.S. last year and roll out across Europe in Q1. And we are seeing strong demand for our commercial portfolio as companies plan for office reopenings. We are earning accolades for industry leadership in areas such as hybrid work, security and print sustainability.\nIt was an outstanding quarter for our industrial printing businesses. In industrial graphics, we generated another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This illustrates the positive recovery trend from prior quarter. And we delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth in 3D printing. More than 120 million Multi Jet Fusion parts have been printed, and we are accelerating our strategy to create high-value end-to-end applications in vertical markets.\nAlong these lines, we completed the acquisition of Choose Packaging. Choose has invented the world's only commercially available zero-plastic paper bottle, and they are working with many global brands to commercialize their offerings, including large enterprises like Henkel. This acquisition complements our molded fiber solution and positions HP well in the $10 billion fiber-based sustainable packaging industry.\nThere are more than 150 million tons of single-use plastics produced each year, and we intend to disrupt this market with fiber-based 100% plastic-free packaging. In fact, our focus on sustainability is driving innovation across our entire portfolio. In Personal Systems, we now have more than 300 products made using ocean bottle plastic. And in Print, we recently launched the most sustainable toner cartridge we have ever developed. This supports our broader ESG and sustainable impact strategy.\nThe actions we are taking on climate, human rights and digital equity are differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business forward. In fact, our sustainable impact agenda helped us to win more than $3.5 billion in new sales in fiscal 2021. This is a threefold increase over the previous year, reflecting the power of our commitments. Our partners are also doubling down on sustainability. More than 10,000 channel partners across over 40 countries are now able to participate in HP Amplify impact, a first-of-its-kind partner program aligned with our sustainable impact strategy. It is a great example of how we are leveraging our global scale to help address some of society's biggest challenges while also positioning our business for success.\nThe progress we are making across our strategic priority is driving strong cash flow. And we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust return-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation strategy. We expect to continue to make organic and inorganic investments in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders, and we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year '22.\nIt was an excellent start to the year. We are delivering on our commitment and creating significant value for our shareholders. We are returning highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth as we build a stronger HP. Let me now turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q2 outlook. Marie, over to you.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to connect with all of you again. I want to start where Enrique left off in terms of our performance in the quarter. It was a very strong start to the year. Demand for our technology, favorable trends such as hybrid and powerful innovation across our portfolio are driving long-term value creation. And you see this reflected in our Q1 results as we delivered across all of our key financial metrics, including growing revenue, operating profit and EPS.\nLet me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $17 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 1%, EMEA increased 8% and APJ increased 28%. Demand remains strong, creating sustained tailwinds across our businesses. But as Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints remain a top line headwind for both Personal Systems and Print revenue. These dynamics were particularly impactful to our Print hardware results, which I will talk about in a moment.\nGross margin was 19.9% in the quarter, down 1.3 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by increased Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities and logistics, partially offset by pricing, including currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.1% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market, partially offset by lower Personal Systems R&D due to partner funding.\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 1.5% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.18 or 20% to $1.10, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $117 million, primarily related to: restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.99.\nNow let's turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $12.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Total units were down 6%, given the expected supply chain challenges, logistics delays and lower chrome mix. Despite this, we still grew revenue double digits, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, favorable pricing and our mix shift towards higher-value categories like mainstream and premium commercial. As an example, commercial PC Windows units were up over 20% year-on-year.\nDrilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 1% and commercial was up 26%. By product category, revenue was up 14% for notebooks, 17% for desktops and 40% for workstations. We also continued to drive double-digit growth across peripherals, gaming and device-as-a-service, each of which are part of what Enrique shared as our focus on creating a more growth-oriented portfolio.\nPersonal Systems delivered almost $1 billion of operating profit with operating margins of 7.8%. Our margin improved 0.7 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including currency, product mix, operating expense mix and R&D funding, partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment.\nIn Q1, total Print revenue was $4.8 billion, down 4%, driven by lower print hardware units and lower supplies revenue. This was partially offset by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 28%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend into the second half of 2022.\nBy customer segment, consumer revenue was down 23% with units down 31%. Commercial revenue grew 9% with units down 3%. Consumer print demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by the current supply chain and logistics environment. The commercial recovery showed further progress, with hardware revenue growth and double-digit increases in both industrial graphics and large format. We expect to see a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending through 2022.\nSupplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook that we provided at our Analyst Day. The decline was driven primarily by further normalization in home printing, as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in commercial. We saw momentum in our contractual business, with Instant Ink once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth in revenue. We also drove Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with renewal TCV up double digit.\nPrint operating profit was $879 million, declining $119 million and operating margin was 18.2%. Operating margin decreased 1.6 points, driven primarily by a tough prior year compare and higher costs, including commodity and logistics costs. This was partially offset by pricing, including currency and improved performance in industrial graphics and 3D.\nNow let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we move into the third year of our cost savings program, we remain steadfast in our focus on delivering on our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. In Print, for example, we are modernizing our digital ecosystem by consolidating our software and firmware platforms. Our new architecture provides a digital ecosystem, allowing us to develop modern capabilities and services offerings to drive differentiated customer experiences via our HP Smart App.\nIn addition, we are leveraging these digital ecosystem enhancements to streamline and scale our big data platform capabilities, allowing us to gain valuable real-time insights about our customers and business operations. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are enabling these types of strategic growth drivers, and we see many more opportunities to drive business enablement through additional software, services and solutions offerings.\nNow let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow for operations and free cash flow was strong at $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 33 days in the quarter. This improved 8 days sequentially as higher days payable outstanding and lower days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the increase in days of inventory.\nSignificant capital return remains a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 127% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $271 million in cash dividends. We expect to aggressively buy back shares of at least $4 billion in FY '22, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target.\nLooking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY '22, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the overall macro environment. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. We are raising our full year outlook for FY '22 to reflect the strength of our Q1 results and expected strength of our Q2 performance. We expect currency to be about 1% year-over-year headwind for FY '22. With regard to the financial impact of the unfolding situation in Ukraine, including the current sanctions on Russia, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that the situation remains fluid and highly uncertain.\nIn Q2, we expect a negative impact to our top line and bottom line as a result of the sanctions that have been imposed. In total, net of mitigations, we have factored in a $0.02 to $0.03 EPS headwind to our Q2 guidance. For the second half of '22, the broad ramifications of the situation in Europe and beyond are uncertain and we are monitoring this closely.\nFor Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue through fiscal '22 with a further shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. Specifically for Q2, we expect our top line results to be incrementally constrained by a volatile supply chain and logistics environment and also the dynamic macro environment, including the Russia situation, all negatively impacting our top line.\nIn total, we expect a high single-digit decline quarter-on-quarter to Personal Systems revenue. We expect PS margins at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q2. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022.\nWith regard to print supply chain, we expect, similar to what we saw in Q1, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these supply chain constraints to continue into the second half of 2022. We now expect Print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY '22. For Q2 specifically, given the continued hardware constraints we are anticipating, we expect Print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range.\nTaking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.08, and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.01. We expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.38, and FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.87 to $4.07.\nFor FY '22, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. We are making excellent progress against our priorities, and I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth. I'll stop here so we can take your questions.",

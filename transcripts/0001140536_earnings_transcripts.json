Please go ahead, sir. Carl Hess, you may begin.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for WTW's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer; Julie Gebauer, our President of Health, Wealth & Career; and Lucy Clarke, our President of Risk & Broking, are also joining us for our Q&A session.\nWe delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by consistent and strong execution of our strategy. In the third quarter, we generated 5% organic growth, 230 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS of $3.07, up 11% year-over-year. We've sustained our momentum in the market and remain on track to deliver our full year financial objectives. I want to thank all my WTW colleagues for their hard work and dedication to achieving our strategic and financial goals.\nAs these results show, the strategy we laid out nearly 1 year ago to accelerate performance, enhance efficiency and optimize our portfolio continues to drive value for all our stakeholders despite the volatile macroeconomic environment. Against that backdrop, I'd like to provide some observations on current market conditions. Concerns about global trade, inflation and geopolitical conditions remain, creating both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, some clients are looking for support to manage the related people and risk issues, and on the other, some companies are continuing to limit discretionary spending. We continue to monitor relevant economic indicators such as employment levels, which may affect our business prospects over the short term. In addition, we're facing headwinds from declining rates in certain segments of the commercial insurance market across various geographies. In the face of this dynamic environment, our businesses continue to be resilient as we remain intensely focused on providing relevant services that deliver value to our clients.\nHealth, Wealth & Career career delivered steady 4% organic growth or 5% when excluding book of business settlement activity and interest income with strong margin expansion. These results reflect our diversified and recurring revenue base and disciplined cost management. Like last quarter, we saw robust demand for our solutions that help clients manage their health care costs, derisk their defined benefit pension plans and adapt to new legislative and regulatory requirements such as the EU pay transparency directive. We also experienced an increase in M&A due diligence and integration work as well as in workforce management support. Our suite of technology tools continues to be a prominent factor in our success.\nFor example, our talent flow analysis utilizes web crawling and data mining to identify clients' real competition for talent, which is essential for meaningful benchmarking. And our Health and Benefit Scout tool informs health plan design through an in-depth evaluation of health care access, quality and cost based on a client's workforce location, demographics, claim experience and more. Through predictive analytics, we help forecast benefits cost and attrition risks, identify skills gap and detect pay equity issues. We're also using AI tools to improve the employee experience.\nIn Risk & Broking, we generated 6% organic growth in the quarter and expanded adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter that our Corporate Risk & Broking business recorded high single-digit growth, excluding the impacts of book of business activity and interest income. I'm pleased with the strong returns on our investments in talent and innovation, and we continue to look for opportunities to invest further. In particular, our investments in digital tools, AI and automation have helped R&B capture growth opportunities and create efficiencies. As declining rates continue to pressure certain areas of the market, the impact of these investments has been increasingly valuable in driving meaningful efficiency gains and advancing our progress on delivering 100 basis points of annual average adjusted operating margin expansion in R&D over the medium term. We continue to launch a steady cadence of new tools and products that support our growth and margin objectives.\nFor example, we recently launched the newest version of Radar, an end-to-end rating and analytics software widely used by insurers. Radar 5 brings advanced capabilities, including GenAI techniques, to provide greater speed and agility for pricing, portfolio management, claims and underwriting, enabling insurers to unlock smarter data-driven decision-making at scale. We also launched Gemini, our global digital placement facility in the quarter. This innovative solution provides efficient access to additional insurance capacity, addresses the increasing complexity of risk and market volatility, offers competitive pricing declines at a guaranteed discount and is backed by A+ rated void syndicates.\nNow I'll turn to some of our new business wins in the quarter. In Health, Wealth & Career are customer-centric solutions, differentiated technology and focus on making smart connections continue to drive growth across all our businesses. In a notable example, we unseated the long-time incumbent providing global actuarial work for our Fortune 250 engineering company, not only because of consistent actuarial expertise and tools across our global network, but also because of the innovative ideas we brought them to better manage pension risks around the world and to address retirement readiness for their workforce.\nIn a win featuring smart connections across HWC we were selected to support the planned spin-off of a global Fortune 50 company with overall program management, communication and change management and the implementation and administration of a new U.S. health plan. We won this business, which encompasses 40,000 employees after building a strong reputation as a trusted partner to the parent organization. Another innovative HWC win involves the extension of our Embark Employee Experience portal to potential new hires of a health system to showcase their total rewards and culture with the aim of boosting new higher acceptance rates.\nIn Risk and Broking, our specialization strategy and our ability to offer differentiated value through our technical expertise, global collaboration and client-centric solutions continue to be key factors in bringing in new business. For example, in CRB, despite a challenging risk environment, we covered property damage, business interruption and liability insurance for an energy portfolio in Eastern Europe. The client reached out to us directly as our technical knowledge of these types of assets and our global industry relationships are well known in the marketplace, highlighting the value of our specialization strategy. We also secured a significant new mandate in Europe covering property damage and business interruption for a leader in the electric vehicle sector. Teams from different regions coordinated to identify and address gaps in the clients' coverage while achieving a premium reduction all in just 3 weeks. This win underscores our ability to deliver cost-efficient solutions to support high-growth, innovation-driven clients with complex coverage needs.\nBefore turning it over to Andrew, I want to provide an update on we do, our enterprise delivery organization. We were especially pleased with the margin expansion we delivered this quarter across the business. Over the past quarter and as we look ahead, we do is helping us continue to improve how we operate, leveraging automation and AI to enhance efficiency and deliver savings. Our approach combines generative and analytical technologies to identify opportunities, design more efficient solutions and automate processes. With we do back automation projects, we've streamlined billing, collections and payments to drive stronger margins and free cash flow, which were reflected in our results this quarter.\nOverall, I'm pleased with how we performed this quarter. We delivered solid financial results in line with our expectations with mid-single-digit organic growth and meaningful margin expansion across both segments. We have good momentum across the business, giving us added confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2025 targets.\nAnd now I'll pass it on to Andrew for a more detailed discussion of the financials.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In the third quarter, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 5% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 230 basis points year-over-year to 20.4% or 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement when excluding TRANZACT. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.07, which is an increase of approximately 11% over the prior year. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of TRANZACT on December 31, 2024. And for the full year 2025, this will create a headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14.\nAs Carl discussed, our solid third quarter results reflect the strong foundation we've built and the benefits of our investments in talent and technology. Our strategy is resonating with clients and colleagues and our businesses remain highly resilient despite the macro uncertainty. We remain firmly focused on our strategic objectives and the financial framework outlined at Investor Day to create long-term shareholder value.\nTurning to our segment results. Health, Wealth & Career revenue grew 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of book of business settlement activity and interest income growth was 5%. Our results for the third quarter are in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver mid-single-digit growth and margin expansion for HWC in 2025. As a reminder, the vast majority of HWC's business is recurring, with only a small portion being more economically sensitive and discretionary. Our Health business achieved strong growth of 7% this quarter or 8% growth, excluding the impact of book of business settlement activity and interest income. This growth was primarily driven by double-digit increases in international and solid performance in North America. Results in International were driven by new global benefit management and local appointments, successful renewals, health care inflation and market expansion. In North America, focused sales efforts generated growth across all market segments. In Europe, growth was offset by a significant book of business sale in the prior year third quarter.\nExcluding the impact of interest income and book of business settlement activity, Health has grown 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect strong demand across the global business driven by health care inflation and employers continued focus on managing costs while maintaining competitive employee benefits. With a healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year, even with a high double-digit growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year.\nWealth had revenue growth 5% in the third quarter primarily from strong levels of retirement work in Great Britain and North America. Demand for our core defined benefit work, including financial forecasting, compliance support and data projects remain strong. We also saw growth in project work to support pension derisking, surplus utilization and workforce restructuring. Our investments business delivered growth primarily from new products and client wins. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in the Wealth business for the year.\nCareer growth was 2% in the third quarter, with solid growth in Europe, driven by strong demand for EU pay transparency support and employee communication projects. While compensation benchmarking survey work increased across all regions, a change in the survey delivery pattern limited growth this quarter when compared to the same period last year. We are confident revenue growth will increase meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to this change in the pattern combined with the continued demand for advisory work related to the EU pay transparency directive that goes into effect mid-2026. We continue to expect Career to grow low to mid-single digits in 2025. Over the long term, we expect mid-single-digit growth based on our track record and continued focus on product and technology offerings alongside recurring services.\nBenefits, Delivery & Outsourcing, or BD&O, grew 2% versus last year's third quarter, driven by growth in outsourcing due to increased project and core administration work in Europe which was partially offset by lower commission revenue in the individual marketplace, our B2B2C Medicare Exchange business. Keep in mind that our Medicare Exchange generates about 80% of its revenue in the fourth quarter due to the timing of the Medicare enrollment period. In combination with the timing of new business, BD&O overall generates nearly half of its revenue in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we forecast BD&O growth to be strongest in the fourth quarter of the year, reflecting the expected timing of commissions, new client implementations and new projects to support regulatory changes. We continue to expect BD&O to grow at mid-single digits for the year.\nHWC's operating margin in the third quarter was 28.6%, an increase of 390 basis points compared to the prior year or an increase of 100 basis points, excluding the impact of the TRANZACT divestiture. This result demonstrates our ability to consistently deliver incremental margin expansion regardless of cyclical macro conditions and supports our strong track record of margin expansion in HWC.\nLet me move on to Risk & Broking, which had revenue growth of 6%, underscoring the continued momentum in the business. Our specialization strategy and our investments in talent, data and technology continue to drive sustainable growth. Corporate Risk & Broking grew 6% or 7% when excluding both book of business activity and interest income. This was on top of the 10% growth rate achieved in the prior year comparable quarter. As Carl mentioned, this is the 11th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth when excluding both book of business activity and interest income.\nCRB's growth this quarter was primarily driven by our global specialization strategy which continued to support expansion amid the more challenging rate environment. Of note, we generated significant new business across a number of markets this quarter as well as project revenue recognized in our Global Specialty businesses, with notable contributions from construction, surety and credit risk solutions. This illustrates that our commitment to global specialization continues to generate value for clients and drive growth.\nFrom a macro perspective, and relative to last quarter, we are seeing a more challenging growth environment as market rates continue to soften across various lines. Nonetheless, our specialization strategy is resonating in the market and we are pleased by the results we are seeing from our Global Specialty businesses. We continue to expect mid- to high single-digit growth in CRB for 2025. While industry-wide pricing pressure is making high single-digit growth harder, we believe it is still attainable.\nIn our Insurance, Consulting & Technology business, revenue was flat versus last year's third quarter when ICT delivered 7% growth. Our combined approach of Consulting & Technology continues to add value. However, trends we highlighted last quarter persist as the consulting environment has remained weak and clients continue to demonstrate caution for making large multiyear technology implementation decisions. While we are encouraged by our pipeline on the technology sales side, we do not expect to see a meaningful pickup in consulting activity in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit growth.\nTurning back to R&B's results overall. We are pleased with our momentum year-to-date, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. As I mentioned a moment ago, although the path to achieving high single-digit growth is more challenging given the current pricing environment, we believe it is still possible. R&B's operating margin was 18.8% for the third quarter, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year or a 100 basis point improvement when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. This was primarily driven by operating leverage from strong organic growth performance, coupled with continued expense discipline. Foreign exchange rates were a headwind of 30 basis points to R&B's operating margin in the third quarter due to weakening U.S. dollar, but we expect the full year foreign exchange impact to be slightly more modest.\nSo far this year, we achieved 90 basis points of operating margin improvement in R&B or 120 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign currency and we are committed to delivering 100 basis points of average annual adjusted operating margin expansion over the next 3 years. As Carl highlighted earlier, investments we've made in our technology capabilities continue to provide value and provide a strong platform for us to deliver ongoing operating leverage and efficiencies across the business.\nFinally, I will give some additional color on our enterprise level results. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 20.4%, a 230 basis point improvement over the prior year, reflecting strong margin expansion in the segments and prudent business expense management supported in part by our WE DO initiative. This result includes a 110 basis point tailwind from the TRANZACT divestiture. As we enter Q4, our seasonally strongest quarter of the year, all our businesses are operating with continued discipline and rigor, giving us confident in our ability to continue to expand margins. Foreign currency was a $0.04 tailwind to adjusted EPS for the quarter and a $0.05 headwind year-to-date in 2025. The U.S. dollar has been weakening during the quarter. So I want to give you some additional color on foreign exchange.\nAt the current spot rates, we expect a foreign currency tailwind to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.10 for the full year. Of course, the impact may fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.7% versus 16.1% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 19.7% for the third quarter of 2024. We expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be relatively consistent with the prior full year rate. We generated free cash flow of $838 million for the 9 months ending September 30, 2025, an increase of $114 million from the prior year. This was driven by operating margin expansion and reduced transformation program cash costs.\nThe favorable second half setup we anticipated began to play out this quarter. As we previously noted, the remaining transformation costs continue to abate and the divestiture of TRANZACT will act as a tailwind to free cash flow as we lap the prior year fourth quarter in which that business recorded net cash outflows. We remain on track to deliver our objective of annual free cash flow margin expansion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $690 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $600 million and dividends of $90 million. We continue to view share repurchases as one of our primary methods of capital return and an attractive use of capital to efficiently deliver value to WTW shareholders. We continue to expect share repurchases to total approximately $1.5 billion in 2025, subject to market conditions and potential capital allocation to inorganic investment opportunities. Looking ahead, we're confident our balanced and disciplined capital allocation approach will generate long-term shareholder value. We'll continue to be selective as we invest in talent and in our platform to ensure we're driving sustainable growth and margin expansion.\nIn closing, we are pleased by our performance year-to-date in 2025. We are increasingly seeing the execution of our strategy manifest in our results, giving us solid momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. We remain confident in delivering on our 2025 financial objectives of mid-single-digit organic growth, adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth and ongoing improvement in free cash flow margin.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please refer to wtwco.com for the press release and supplemental information that were issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW's website. Some of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law. For a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, Investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning as well as in the most recent Form 10-K and other subsequent WTW SEC filings.\nDuring the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed. To provide direct comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the company's revenue growth, results will be on a non-GAAP organic basis unless specifically stated otherwise. For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Julie Gebauer, our President of Health, Wealth and Career; and Lucy Clarke, our President of Risk & Broking, are also joining us for our Q&A session. .\nIn the second quarter, we delivered 5% organic growth, 150 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS of $2.86 up roughly 20% year-over-year. Through our focused execution, these results were in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we remain on track to deliver on our full year financial objectives.\nOur solid first half results underscore the progress we have made advancing the strategic objectives we introduced at our Investor Day last December. Our strategy to accelerate performance, enhance efficiency and optimize our portfolio continues to be a key driver of our results, especially in the face of a dynamic macroeconomic environment. We remain committed to our strategy and its execution, and we are confident in the value it will continue to generate.\nI want to sincerely thank all WTW colleagues for their commitment in executing these objectives. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty in our business, noting near-term headwinds in the Motor Consulting businesses, especially for discretionary projects as well as potential longer-term tailwinds when conditions improve and clients begin responding more assertively to change.\nThere were positive signs of improvement as the quarter went on, as capital markets rebounded and our businesses adapted to changes in demand and buyer sentiment. Clients are increasingly turning to us to help address the many people, risk and capital they're facing amidst rising global trade inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. We feel positive about both our outlook and our ability to deliver for the second half of the year.\nIn Health, Wealth & Carrier, our strong mix of recurring revenue that supports required activities and our geographical diversification continue to provide a stable foundation for growth and for margin expansion. In the current environment, there continues to be significant demand for solutions focused on managing health care costs, derisking pension obligations and core pay benchmarking work.\nAnd as we see consumer and corporate confidence begin to improve, we're also seeing increased demand for broad-based compensation design, benefits governance reviews and merger integration support. In Risk & Broking, the pace of innovation and continued challenges in global trade and inflationary and geopolitical issues are elevating both business opportunities and risk. This is demonstrated in CRB's top line performance.\nQ2 marks the 10th consecutive quarter where our Corporate Risk & Broking business recorded high single-digit growth when excluding the impact of both gain on sale activity and interest income. Our strength in specialty and the relentless focus of our team are clearly resonating with the market and clients.\nI remain confident in the growth trajectory and resilience of our business amidst economic uncertainty thanks to our proven ability to help our clients thrive in challenging circumstances, time and time again. In addition, our consistent strategy execution is yielding clear benefits. The company has taken a holistic and intentional approach to technology and its role in accelerating growth and enhancing efficiency.\nThere is observable progress in many client-centric and digital efforts such as the global broking platform, AI tools supporting digital interaction and solutions that streamline data ingestion and further automate workflows, which allow our colleagues to further differentiate WTW in the market and win new work. Our rollout of the global broking platform has demonstrated the power of seamlessly connecting brokers with the markets.\nThe adoption of our broking platform is progressing on schedule, and it has and will continue to streamline service delivery and efficiency. We're also seeing early results in through the WTW Enterprise delivery organization or we do, we are raising AI literacy and fostering adoption throughout the company. We have several AI-augmented tools that are making measurable differences for both clients and colleagues.\nAI-powered solutions are enhancing real-time analytics and reducing manual effort by streamlining data ingestion, analysis and workflows. In some instances, we've seen a 75% reduction in routine work in processing time. In other areas, AI infused voice spots, chatbots and guided digital experiences are enhancing the client experience and satisfaction. We remain committed to harnessing the potential of our investments by balancing bold innovations with sustainable returns.\nThe benefits we're seeing across the enterprise are measurable, and we intend to maintain pace and uphold rigor in ensuring these investments deliver net positive outcomes for our clients, our colleagues and, ultimately, our shareholders. I'm looking forward to sharing more about our progress and the long-term potential benefits to both growth and margins.\nThis quarter, we continue to record strong new business wins, with specialty, technology and global collaboration consistently being why we win in the market. In Health, Wealth & Carrier, our innovative products and solutions together with our focus on making smart connections continue to drive growth across all our businesses. For example, in Europe, a large global shipping and logistics company chose WTW's global benefits management program for 70,000 employees around the world.\nKey to delivering this win were our deep expertise and strong reputation in Global Benefits management alongside innovative tools and technology. In the Wealth space, our innovative LifeSight platform in the U.K. was selected by a prominent medical association as its new master trust pension provider. WTW won the business from one of our main competitors due to the deep technical knowledge and clear articulation of the value we provide, coupled with our reputation for quality client service.\nAnd another great example, a major oil and gas company began using our career business's new AI-driven automated job leveling tool to support regular restructuring across their business areas as they go through a significant transformation and change. To quote them, \"We wouldn't have been able to evaluate 300 roles in 3 days without this tool.\" It was business critical to complete this work with speed and confidence while going through their transformation.\nIn Risk & Broking, we continue to benefit from our specialization strategy and our ability to deliver differentiated value through technical expertise, global collaboration and client-centric solutions. For example, after obtaining our license to act as an insurance broker in Saudi Arabia, we successfully placed property damage and comprehensive giant enteral liability insurance for one of the world's largest chemical manufacturers.\nOur team's deep knowledge of the industry and our ability to tailor technical solutions to this client's needs were key to winning this mandate. We look forward to the opportunities for growth in the Middle East, which remains a key market for WTW. Our ability to provide tailored specialized solutions continues to resonate with clients and transform businesses and it's positioning WTW to capture market share in high-growth industry sectors to fuel our own expansion.\nFor instance, our construction specialty business is seeing strong results from sizable construction placements for data centers, an industry sector forecasted to experience significant global growth. Our specialty model and our depth of expertise allows us to add value throughout the data center life cycle from land identification through funding and construction, powering the facility and into operational management or divestment.\nIn addition, our construction and natural resources teams are working together to support clients on clean energy technologies during the construction and operational stages. We expect exponential growth with rising global demand in this area. And these are 2 great examples in our CRB business of how our highly agile specialty business model coupled with our expertise, allows us to spot opportunities and plan for rapid growth.\nFurthermore, our cutting-edge technology and analytics have proven to help clients transform their businesses. Recently, a large U.K. health insurer decided to engage our insurance consulting and technology business to lead their pricing transformation initiative using Radar vision. Radar Vision is an AI-driven modeling tool for insurer clients, and it generates early actionable insights related to inflation, markets, competitors and customer behaviors to help insurers manage pricing, underwriting and claims. The implementation of Radar Vision helped our clients sustain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market, while also reinforcing WTW's reputation as a trusted partner in pricing transformation and analytics innovation.\nLastly, I want to reinforce our commitment and disciplined approach to optimizing our portfolio. I've highlighted some of the success of our organic investments, but our inorganic growth strategy remains consistent with our prior comments, and we're deliberately patient and focused on: first, enhancing our broking and wealth presence in key markets, while strengthening our offerings in high-growth, high-margin areas of our core business.\nSecond, expanding our reach across the insurance value chain to further accelerate our growth, while filling gaps in our capabilities and footprint. And third, finding businesses that are good strategic fits that help us enhance our margin and free cash flow profile. We're pleased to have announced an investment in the United Arab Emirates, along with plans for Alpha Team Willis to become a wholly-owned WTW business. This acquisition further enhances our value proposition and client experience delivered to global and local clients and it directly complements our recent investments in Saudi Arabia by strengthening our presence in the Middle East.\nWe're looking forward to continuing to work with our partners, Al Qutaim in the UAE to build on our years of success together. Looking ahead, we will look for ways to continue to balance our capital management strategy. We'll be intentional in delivering long-term operating and free cash flow margin expansion which will ultimately create long-term value for our shareholders.\nIn summary, results this quarter were solid as we delivered organic revenue growth that contributed to meaningful margin expansion across both segments. We look forward to building on these results in the second half of the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 guidance, including mid-single-digit organic growth, adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth and ongoing improvement in free cash flow margin.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 5% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points year-over-year to 18.5% or 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement when excluding the tailwind from the divestiture of TRANZACT. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.86, which is an increase of approximately 20% over the prior year. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of TRANZACT on December 31, 2024. And for the full year 2025, this will create a $1.14 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share. .\nAs Carl discussed, our solid second quarter results reflect the strong foundation we've built and the benefits of the investments in talent and technology we've made recently. Our strategy continues to resonate with clients and colleagues and our businesses are highly resilient despite the uncertain operating environment. We are relentlessly focused on our strategic objectives, long-term shareholder value creation and the financial framework outlined at Investor Day.\nTurning to our segment results. Health, Wealth, & Carrier revenue grew 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw a sequential improvement in growth and a strengthening pipeline during the quarter, although clients remain cautious about the macro environment. 4% growth for the second quarter is in line with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver mid-single-digit growth and margin expansion for HWC in 2025. As a reminder, the vast majority of HWC's business is recurring, with only a small portion being more economically sensitive and discretionary.\nOur Health business achieved strong growth of 8% this quarter or 9% growth, excluding the impact of interest income and gain on sale activity. All regions saw a robust growth, driven by double-digit increases outside of North America and solid performance in North America. Strong new business and focus on client retention remain key drivers of growth, coupled with the ongoing appeal of our global benefits management solution.\nIn North America, focused sales efforts and mid-market growth led to an increase in commissions, while consulting projects increased with greater demand for cost management and legislative change projects. Looking ahead, we anticipate demand to remain strong for the Health business, driven by health care inflation and employers' ongoing need to manage cost while providing a competitive employee value proposition. We also successfully introduced our enhanced mid-market solution in North America and launched new panels and facilities.\nOverall, we've established a healthy pipeline for the second half of the year. Excluding the impact of interest income and gain on sale activity, Health grew 8% in the first half, and we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year 2025. Wealth had revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the retirement business, which delivered growth across all geographies and solutions. Our core defined benefits consulting offerings remained resilient and we saw growth in project work to support legislative changes, pension risk transfers and workforce actions.\nIn addition, we continue to expand our client base for our LifeSight master trust and insurance solutions. Our investments business saw a low single-digit growth with new products and client wins, offset by capital market volatility, the latter of which improved as the quarter progressed. This was a headwind we pointed out last quarter and expected it to impact investments results in the second quarter. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in the Wealth business for the year.\nCareer growth was 1% in the second quarter with solid growth outside of North America driven by healthy demand for paid transparency support, compensation design and employee communication projects, and a net positive increase in Compensation Committee appointment. As we communicated in the first quarter, advisory growth in North America was expected to be tempered by delays in certain discretionary projects.\nWhile lingering macroeconomic uncertainty may continue to impact some of our clients' decision-making, we expect revenue growth to increase in the second half due to the seasonality of compensation benchmarking surveys and increased support required to prepare for the EU Pay transparency directive that goes into effect in mid-2026.\nDiscretionary advisory project work only comprises about 1/3 of our career business or less than 5% of the HWC segment. As we previously communicated, we expect Career to grow low to mid-single digits in 2025. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in the long term based on our past and continued focus on product and technology offerings and recurring services.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing or BD&O was flat versus last year's second quarter when we delivered 7% growth, excluding TRANZACT. BD&O revenue benefited from growth in outsourcing due to increased project and core administration work in Europe, which was offset by lower commission revenue in the individual marketplace business. It is important to remember that even following the sale of TRANZACT, BD&O maintains a B2B2C Medicare business and still generates nearly half of its revenue in the fourth quarter.\nThe seasonality of this business is driven by the timing of the Medicare enrollment period and new business generation, which is even more acute within individual marketplace where the fourth quarter is about 80% of its annual revenues. Accordingly, we forecast BD&O growth to be stronger in the second half of the year, especially with the expected timing of commissions, new client implementations and new projects to support regulatory changes. We continue to expect BD&O to grow at mid-single digits for the year.\nHWC's operating margin in the second quarter was 23.8%, an increase of 190 basis points compared to the prior year or an increase of 20 basis points, excluding the impact of the TRANZACT divestiture. This demonstrates our ability to consistently deliver incremental margin expansion in cyclical macro conditions and adds to our strong track record of margin expansion in HWC.\nLet me move on to Risk & Broking, which delivered another strong quarter with revenue growth of 6%, underscoring the continued momentum in the business. Our specialization strategy and our investments in talent, data and technology continue to pay dividends. Corporate Risk & Broking delivered another strong quarter, growing 6% or 7% when excluding both book of business activity and fiduciary interest income. Notably, this is on top of 11% achieved in the prior year and, as Carl mentioned, this is the 10th consecutive quarter in a row of high single-digit growth when excluding book of business activity and fiduciary interest income.\nCRB's growth was broad based across all regions, driven by sustained client retention in the mid-90s and strong business generation around the world. Importantly, we expanded our market presence with meaningful client wins in the Middle East, some of which Carl already highlighted. Our global specialization strategy remains a key growth driver for CRB. Our investments are yielding value as demonstrated by its growth continuing to outpace the rest of the segment.\nGlobally, our construction, facultative, surety and natural resource specialty lines continue to deliver strong performance, and we're meeting full contributors to CRB's 6% growth this quarter and 7% growth in the first half of this year. Our recent investment in credit risk solutions, both organically and inorganically, is also helping to accelerate performance. From a geographic perspective, our Global Specialty business had double-digit growth in all of our geographies, underpinned by strong client retention and new business generation.\nWe are excited by the results we are seeing from our specialization investments and we expect mid- to high single-digit growth to continue in CRB for 2025.\nIn our Insurance, Consulting and Technology business, revenue was flat versus the same quarter last year. Our pipeline is strong for the second half of the year, especially on the technology sales side, but we observed a weaker consulting environment during the quarter as well as a more conservative buying behavior for large multiyear technology implementations. Consulting offer services such as reserve calculations, financial and capital modeling and discretionary projects like transaction services for insurers, whereas technology offers software products that support advanced analytics for claims, underwriting, rate making and reserving for insurance clients with large multiyear contracts that tend to have longer sales cycles.\nWe have been making a focused effort to bring the combined proposition of consulting and technology closer together to create more value for clients and to drive growth. For the full year, we are now expecting low single to mid-single-digit growth in ICT.\nTurning back to R&B segment results overall. We are pleased with R&B's momentum year-to-date, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. R&B's operating margin was 21.2% for the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year or 100 basis points improvement when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This was primarily driven by operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth performance, coupled with continued expense discipline as well as benefits from prior year transformation savings.\nForeign exchange was a headwind of 40 basis points to RMB's operating margin in the second quarter due to the weakening U.S. dollar, but we expect the full year foreign exchange impact to be more modest. We achieved 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in R&B D so far this year, and we are committed to delivering 100 basis points of average annual adjusted operating margin expansion over the next 3 years.\nThe strategic investments we made in our Global Broking platform, our global placement strategy as well as our digital automation and workflow optimization, our strong foundations for additional operating leverage and efficiencies, and we will see these investments continue to deliver benefits for years to come.\nFinally, I will give some additional color on our enterprise level results. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 18.5%, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year, primarily driven by the strong margin expansion in the segments and prudent business expense management. The adjusted operating margin includes a 50 basis point tailwind from the TRANZACT divestiture for the quarter. As we enter the second half of 2025, all of our businesses are operating with discipline and rigor, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to expand margins.\nForeign currency was neutral on adjusted EPS for the quarter, and a negative $0.09 impact for the first half of 2025. U.S. dollar has been weakening during the quarter, so I want to give you some additional color on foreign exchange. At the current spot rates, we expect an approximately $0.05 tailwind to adjusted EPS for the full year, though the impact may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was negative 6.8% versus 15.6% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 18% compared to 22.4% for the second quarter of 2024. We expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be relatively consistent with the prior year rate. We generated free cash flow of $217 million for the first 6 months ending June 30, 2025, a decrease of $88 million from the prior year.\nThis was driven by increased incentive costs, redesign of one of our ongoing retirement programs, higher cash tax payments and the absence of TRANZACT cash inflows, which were partially offset by reduced transformation program cash costs and operational improvements. Looking at the back half of the year, remaining transformation costs will reduce further and the divestiture of TRANZACT will become a tailwind to free cash flow as we lap the quarters in which that business recorded net cash outflows.\nAdditionally, we received the Willis Re earnout payment in April, and we do not anticipate any material cash tax payments on it in 2025 or beyond. We remain on track to deliver on our free cash flow objective of annual margin expansion and our outlook remains largely unchanged. During the quarter, we returned $591 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $500 million and dividends of $91 million. We view share repurchases as one of the primary method of capital return and an attractive use of capital to efficiently deliver value to shareholders and, therefore, is a central component of our capital allocation strategy.\nWe continue to expect share repurchases to total approximately $1.5 billion in 2025, subject to market conditions and potential capital allocation to inorganic investment opportunities. As we've mentioned, we are taking a more balanced disciplined approach to capital allocation to generate long-term shareholder value. We'll continue to be selective as we invest in talent and in our platform to ensure we're driving sustainable growth and margin expansion.\nIn closing, we are pleased by our business performance in the first half of 2025. We are increasingly seeing the execution of our strategy manifest in our results, giving us confidence in delivering on our 2025 financial objectives and beyond.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to the WTW First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to wtwco.com for the press release and supplemental information that were issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on the WTW website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law. For more details discussed and these other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued in this morning as well as other disclosures in the most recent Form 10-K on the other Willis Tower Watson SEC filings.\nDuring the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Carl Hess, WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Julie Gebauer, our President of Health Wealth and Career; and Lucy Clarke, our President of Risk & Broking, are also joining us for our Q&A session.\nIn the first quarter, we built on our strong finish to 2024 and delivered 5% organic growth, 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and $3.13 of adjusted EPS. This performance was in line with our expectations for quarterly pacing and supports our trajectory toward delivering our full year goals. These solid results are the product of our relentless focus on advancing our strategic objectives.\nIn particular, our efforts to enhance efficiency are strengthening our ability to generate operating leverage and support margin expansion. We remain fully committed to our strategy and are confident in the benefits it will bring, and I want to thank all WTW colleagues for their hard work executing our plans.\nOn that note, let me share our perspective on what we're seeing in the market and how it may affect our businesses. As we've discussed in the past, changing economic and regulatory conditions tend to drive demand for our services. The current heightened risk landscape and macroeconomic volatility create opportunities for us to help our clients manage their cost and risk profiles and lead their organizations through change.\nIn Risk & Broking, concerns about global trade, potential inflationary pressures and growing geopolitical risks have led to considerable uncertainty and elevated risk for many companies. These risks are not evenly distributed by industry, and we believe our specialty approach has enabled us to provide tailored counsel more quickly than we could have under our previous geographic alignment. For example, the global trade landscape has changed significantly due to new American tariffs on steel and other industrial goods, leading to unexpected cost increases in the rebuilding and replacement of damaged property. This poses a financial challenge for businesses dependent on insured property. And to address these risks, WTW introduced the Tariff Guard endorsement, a strategic enhancement to commercial property coverage for natural resources companies.\nTogether with the scale and depth of the solutions we offer, WTW is well positioned to continue to serve as a reliable and trusted partner for our clients. In HWC, the growing share of recurring revenue streams provides a stable, resilient foundation for navigating the current environment. Our deep expertise and strong analytical capabilities position us well to respond to the expected near-term increase in demand for benefits cost management projects, pension forecasting, workforce and total rewards modeling, communication support and more. That said, the heightened geopolitical uncertainty is also creating near-term headwinds in certain areas, particularly in our North America career businesses, where some clients in certain industry sectors may choose to delay discretionary advisory work until they have greater clarity on the macroeconomic outlook.\nSimilarly, we're likely to see a modest decline in assets under management-based fees in our Investments business if capital market conditions persist. As a reminder, these businesses are a small minority of HWC. The vast majority of our HWC revenues are recurring in nature, with client retention rates in the mid-90s, making us confident in our ability to sustain growth in HWC even if economic conditions weaken.\nIn addition, over the longer term, we expect macroeconomic changes to spur more demand for our services as clients seek support in responding to the new environment, a pattern we've seen in prior periods of regulatory shift. I'm confident in the resilience of our business and our colleagues, who have proven their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. Our colleagues' hard work is reflected in the momentum we have built in the market and a strong start we've made this year, implementing our new strategy to accelerate performance, enhance efficiency and optimize our portfolio. We've recorded many strategic wins this quarter that highlight our focus on accelerating performance.\nIn R&D, the strength of our specialization strategy and our ability to deliver differentiated value through technical expertise, global collaboration and client-centric solutions were key factors in these wins. In Europe, we secured a complex construction mandate tied to what is expected to become the largest urban development in the region. This opportunity was a result of the close coordination of our construction specialists globally and effective cross-selling from our regional colleagues.\nAlso in Europe, we expanded our existing mandate with a major global airline to be the sole broker for property and casualty and local lines, displacing several of our major competitors due to our specialized industry focus, long-term relationship and more efficient service model. Finally, we were appointed to provide both construction all risk and health and benefits coverage for a key player in the mining and metals sector in West Africa, driven by our innovative solutions, exceptional service offerings and competitive premiums. This appointment demonstrates our ability to offer clients integrated solutions across our R&D and HWC businesses and highlights the value of our global platform.\nIn HWC, we successfully accelerated performance by growing our core business and making smart connections. For example, a global appliance manufacturer who arrives on us for global pension actuarial work shows us their global benefits management work across more than 50 countries because of the strength of our global network and the strategic insight we delivered on program design and financing. In another example, we unseated a 20-year incumbent in winning the U.S. health and benefits outsourcing for a major hospitality company. They were compelled to make the change because of our engaging digital tools, our enterprise-grade administration platform and our track record of delivering quality outcomes.\nAgainst a wide range of competitors, a major European financial institution selected us to assist them in a multiyear effort to redesign their group-wide job architecture, implement a new remuneration system and support them with ongoing pay benchmarking. Our industry expertise and business-aligned process set us apart.\nWe continue to focus on enhancing our efficiency through technology. I'm pleased to share that Liberty Specialty Markets is now using Neuron, WTW's digital trading platform for live trading of D&O and cyber risks. Neuron connects brokers and insurers in real time, streamlining complex specialty risk placements. We expect more insurers to join the Neuron platform this year, further enhancing its value and efficiency.\nWE DO, WTW's enterprise delivery organization, is also driving greater efficiency. After investing in global service delivery centers for several years to help standardize our service delivery model, we're now better able to leverage automation, data and AI to further increase margins and deliver more value to clients. For example, as part of WE DO's [ Right Technology ] strategy, we implemented a tool to automate critical data audit and validation tasks for retirement clients. We quickly scaled the solution to 22 countries by putting it in the hands of retirement teams in our global service delivery centers. Process improvements like this helped WTW increase our agility and reduce costs while securing our clients' sensitive data.\nWith regard to portfolio optimization, I'd like to highlight WTW's purchase of Global Commercial Credit, a specialist broker focused on trade credit and political risk insurance. The acquisition adds to our fast-growing specialty strategy and our geographic footprint in a key growth area of the North American market. Though it's a smaller acquisition, it reflects our focus on increasing our exposure to attractive, high-growth and high-margin markets within our existing strategy.\nAnd finally, our reinsurance JV is progressing well. We're encouraged by the momentum and remain confident in its long-term contribution to growth and earnings.\nOverall, I'm pleased with how we started the year, delivering results in line with our expectations. We produced solid revenue growth that supported meaningful margin expansion across both segments. I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 outlook for mid-single-digit organic growth adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth and ongoing improvement in free cash flow margin. We're actively monitoring the macro environment and may adjust our outlook depending on how factors like trade negotiations affect economic stability and growth. We're prepared to proactively manage through changes and adjust priorities as needed to stay aligned with our financial objectives. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 21.6% over Q1 2024 or 80 basis points, excluding the impact of TRANZACT. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.13, excluding the impact of TRANZACT. This reflects an increase of 8% over the prior year. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of TRANZACT on December 31, 2024, which created a $1.14 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share for full year 2025. As Carl discussed, our businesses are primed to perform, and our first quarter results reflect our confidence in the foundation we've established, along with our ongoing commitment to the strategic priorities and financial framework outlined during our Investor Day.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career revenue grew 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. Growth for the quarter met our expectations, and we remain confident in HWC's full year outlook for mid-single-digit growth and continued margin expansion despite the potential headwinds from economic uncertainty in certain businesses that Carl mentioned.\nOur Health business grew 6% this quarter. All regions saw growth, with double-digit increase outside North America driven by solid client retention, strong new business, geographic expansion in Saudi Arabia and the ongoing appeal of our Global Benefits Management solution. In North America, client retention and new mid-market sales led to an increase in commissions, while consulting fees increased with more projects focused on cost management and legislative change. With the potential for health care inflation to go even higher in the current environment, we expect that demand to continue. We continue to expect high single-digit growth in Health for 2025 based on global market momentum, the successful introduction of new products, including our enhanced mid-market solution in North America and our focus on sales excellence.\nWealth revenue grew 2% in the first quarter, driven by low single-digit growth in the Retirement business and high single-digit growth in the Investments business. In Retirement, strong growth outside North America due to increased derisking activity and growth in our LifeSight solutions was partially offset due to the expected negative timing impact of project activity in North America relative to the prior year. Our Investments business delivered high single-digit growth due to new product launches and the positive impact of favorable capital markets performance in the quarter. While the recent market volatility may impact second quarter results, particularly for Investments, we continue to expect low single-digit growth in the Wealth business for the year.\nCareer growth was 1% this quarter, largely in line with our expectations. While growth was tempered somewhat as economic uncertainties led some clients to defer advisory work, we continue to see healthy demand in areas such as pay transparency, incentive design and pay benchmarking. Revenue growth is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year due to the typical seasonality in compensation surveys and timing of project work. As Carl highlighted, the lack of economic and policy clarity may impact the growth of the career business in the short term. However, support for legislative changes and cost management will continue to create demand. And as we highlighted at Investor Day, our focus on product and technology offerings will further mitigate the downside risk associated with the uncertainty. Nonetheless, we see a wider range of potential outcomes for Career this year and anticipate growth in the low to mid-single-digit range.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing saw 1% growth versus the first quarter of last year. BD&O revenue benefited from increased project and core administration work in Europe. We expect growth to accelerate throughout the year with the incidence of special project work to support regulatory changes and the timing of new client implementations. We continue to expect BD&O to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the year.\nHWC's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 26.7%, an increase of 160 basis points compared to the prior year or a 40 basis point improvement, excluding the impact of the TRANZACT divestiture, demonstrating our ability to consistently deliver margin expansion. We have a strong track record of margin expansion in HWC, and we will continue to build on that during 2025.\nMoving to Risk & Broking. First quarter revenue growth was 7%, marking 9 consecutive quarters of high single-digit to double-digit growth. Our specialization strategy and our investments in talent, technology and innovation continue to bear fruit.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter, growing 8%, or 9% when excluding both book of business activity and interest income. Notably, this is on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of 2024. CRB's growth was broad-based across all regions. Our specialization strategy remains a key growth driver for CRB, and specialty continues to outpace the rest of the segment's growth. We continue to see sustained client retention rates in the mid-90s and strong new business generation around the world.\nGlobally, our Construction, Facultative, Crisis Management and Surety specialty lines were major contributors to the strong growth performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, North America had a solid start to the year with notable contributions from our Natural Resources, Surety and M&A businesses. Furthermore, we saw a double-digit growth in our specialty lines across our Great Britain, Western Europe and International geographies, driven by strong new business generation.\nMoving on to our Insurance Consulting and Technology business. Revenue was up 3% across both our technology and consulting practices. As we discussed at Investor Day, our ongoing investment in technology is driving an intentional shift in the mix of offerings in ICT, creating value for our clients by integrating technology and consulting solutions. Q1 growth in ICT was consistent with our projections, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nFor Risk & Broking in total, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. R&B's operating margin was 22% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the prior year first quarter. This was primarily due to operating leverage from our organic revenue growth, as well as transformation savings, partially offset by a combined 100 basis point headwind from foreign currency, lower interest income and the absence of gain on sale activity. As we outlined at our Investor Day last December, we continue to expect to deliver 100 basis points of average annual adjusted operating margin expansion in R&B over the next 3 years, driven by operating leverage and additional efficiencies, including the deployment of our Global Broking platform and workflow optimization.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.6%, a 100 basis point increase over prior year primarily driven by greater operating leverage, which includes the benefits of our now completed Transformation program. Regardless of the macro environment, we remain confident in our operational visibility and control, which strengthens our conviction in delivering margin expansion this year.\nForeign exchange was a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.09 for the quarter. Based on our current outlook and current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have no material impact on adjusted EPS for the full year as the $0.09 headwind from Q1 will unwind by the end of the year.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% versus 19.9% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% compared to 22.3% for the first quarter of 2024. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be relatively consistent with that of 2024. Free cash flow was negative $86 million for the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $50 million from the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of cash collections related to TRANZACT and increased compensation payments. Since TRANZACT historically recorded cash inflows in the first half of the year, followed by larger cash outflows in the second half of the year, TRANZACT's sale will be a net tailwind to free cash flow on a full year basis. As a reminder, free cash flow and free cash flow margin now reflect cash outflows for capitalized software costs for all periods presented in the earnings materials.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect to expand our free cash flow margin driven by the sale of TRANZACT, the wind down of Transformation-related cash outflows and expected annual margin expansion, with a partial offset from cash taxes on the Willis Re earnout payment, which have not yet been paid. During the quarter, we returned $288 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $200 million and dividends of $88 million. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, share repurchases will remain our primary form of capital return and a central component of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to expect to allocate approximately $1.5 billion to share repurchases in 2025, subject to market conditions and potential capital allocation to inorganic investment opportunities.\nGiven our balanced approach to capital allocation, we plan to continue to invest in talent and our platform to drive sustainable growth and expand margins. We will also increasingly emphasize M&A aligned with our strategic priorities of improving our business mix, expanding our reach across the insurance value chain and enhancing our margins and free cash flow.\nIn closing, we are encouraged by our business performance in Q1 and expect to achieve our outlook for 2025. With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge the devastate wildfires in California and express our deepest sympathy to all those affected. For our colleagues, clients and business partners in the areas impacted, our thoughts are [indiscernible] and we will continue to lend our support through this difficult time.\n2024 was a landmark year for WTW. The completion of our 3-year Grow, Simplify and Transform strategic priorities has strengthened our competitive position and enabled us to deliver on our financial targets for 2024. Thanks to our team's focus and collaboration, we entered 2025 with strong momentum in the market and all our businesses playing to perform. As we discussed at our Investor Day in December, 3 years of hard work to Grow, Simplify and Transform have made WTW a faster-growing, more focused and more profitable company. We grew the business by making strategic investments in talent and innovation, simplified our business to become more efficient and agile and transform the business to modernize and enhance how we operate. The successful execution of our strategy was reflected in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results.\nWe delivered 5% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 36.1%, up 190 basis points over the prior year. Excluding TRANZACT, which we divested on December 31, we recorded 6% organic revenue growth and 36.6% adjusted operating margin. Our transformation program, which has now concluded, delivered $27 million of incremental annualized savings during the quarter, bringing total savings over the life of the program to $473 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.13 and 9% increase year-over-year.\nFor the full year, we had organic revenue growth of 5%, in line with our mid-single-digit target or 6%, excluding TRANZACT. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 190 basis points year-over-year to 23.9% or 24.4%, excluding TRANZACT, fulfilling our commitment to annual margin expansion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $16.93, up 17% year-over-year. We're proud of our 2024 performance and are excited for the next chapter at WTW as we implement our new strategy to accelerate performance, enhance efficiency and optimize our portfolio. We're now focused on extending and amplifying our strengths and building on the solid foundation we've created over the last 3 years.\nTo accelerate performance, we're focused on strengthening our core businesses, continuing to innovate, leveraging and expanding our global footprint and advancing connections across our business. To enhance efficiency, we're committed to continuous improvement and delivering on our [indiscernible] efforts to drive both margin and free cash flow improvement. And to optimize our portfolio, we'll proceed by investing organically and inorganically to improve our business mix, guided by a focused investment framework and a rebalanced capital allocation strategy.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, many of our strategic objectives represent an evolution rather than a revolution for our businesses. We feel confident about the path forward because we're focusing on and investing most heavily in our best-performing ideas.\nLet me take a few minutes to share some color around several of our key client wins in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strategic priorities. Our industry-leading analytics capabilities were a key contributor to signing a major global logistics provider to a cross-segment contract, which includes all its global lines of insurance coverage as well as global benefits management. We previously worked with this client a much smaller mandate and by using our Risk Intelligence Software. It changed how the client thought about their insurance portfolio and who they wanted to work with. Together with the trust our team built, our innovative and collaborative solutions led the client to appoint us over their incumbent brokers. We'll continue to focus on strengthening smart connections across our business and going to market collaboratively.\nIn the fourth quarter, this approach alongside our Global Service Delivery Model helped us expand our existing relationship with a large global IT vendor to cover a full spectrum of insurance programs, Global Benefits Management and embark and engage implementations. Similarly, collaboration between our CRB and [ H&B ] teams in Asia and Europe helped secure a brokerage appointment across both businesses for a leading communications technology group in Asia. Highlighting the connectivity of our businesses across segments and regions.\nIn HWC, we're continuing to focus on our core businesses that have sustained mid-single-digit growth in 2016 and delivered 3% organic growth or 6% organic growth, excluding TRANZACT in the fourth quarter. HWC's strategic priorities of core growth, smart connections and innovation will enable us to build on our strong financial track record with sustained revenue growth and further margin expansion. Many of our new business wins in HWC in the fourth quarter reflecting priorities. We continue to add new multiyear client contracts in our core service areas due to our deep tech work [indiscernible] sophisticated analytics and our ability to create breakthroughs that matter.\nOur focus on smart connections resulted in wins that extend across service areas. For example, one of the world's fastest-growing international airlines chose us as their ongoing pension investment adviser, global retirement governance advisor and outsourcing providers. We want Health and Benefits Plan Management and communications work for our Fortune 500 diversified manufacturing company, unseating decades-long incumbents. And one of the largest nonprofit health care systems in the United States ordered us a long-term outsourcing retirement and employee experience contracts. And so the leading logistics company based in Europe.\nIn R&B, as our specialization strategy continues to generate strong results, we're focused on deepening our expertise and expanding our existing specialty lines into new geographies while building the talent and tools to support new specialized lines. In the fourth quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic growth in R&B and won a number of large contracts that reflect the value of our specialization strategy.\nIn CRB, across border teams spanning multiple specialties created a customized construction program for a Middle Eastern mega project of an Asian manufacturing company. Our global collaboration and local expertise helped us secure the work for all risk coverage for the project. And in ICT, we won a multiyear software contract with a large insurer driven by our global analytics capabilities and the efficiency of our technology solutions. I also want to take a moment to highlight our progress on optimizing our portfolio.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of TRANZACT for $632 million on December 31 and expect this divestiture to strengthen our growth rates, operating margins and free cash flow starting in 2025. We're also reentering the reinsurance market through a joint venture with Bain Capital, and Andrew will provide some financial details on that later. And as we discussed at Investor Day, we're taking a focused and disciplined approach to organic investment. We're prioritizing improving our business mix, expanding our reach across the insurance value chain, and enhancing our margins and cash flow. We'll be thoughtful about the opportunities we pursue, recognizing the importance of minimizing business disruption and creating clear cultural alignment.\nAs I look at the year ahead, I feel confident in our position and our outlook for 2025. We have strong momentum in the market. We continue to make steady progress against our strategy and the political and regulatory changes we're seeing in the U.S. and elsewhere across the globe, tend to support client demand for our services. We introduced a financial framework at Investor Day in December that calls for mid-single-digit organic growth, continued annual adjusted operating margin expansion, annual adjusted EPS growth and ongoing growth in free cash flow and free cash flow margin and we'll share more details on our financial performance and outlook shortly.\nBut before I hand it over to him, I want to take a moment to reflect on what we've gained from the journey that we've been on these past 3 years. We have grown, we have simplified and we have transformed, and we are much better for it. I have never been more optimistic about WTW's future. We are more focused, more connected, more efficient and more aligned than we've ever been. And we're keenly focused on realizing our potential to create value for our shareholders. We're well positioned to accelerate performance and deliver profitable growth through innovation and expansion into attractive markets. We're continuing to enhance efficiencies across the company for continued margin expansion and free cash flow improvement. And we're optimizing our business next to elevate our financial performance and our strategic position.\nI want to thank all our colleagues for their contributions to improving WTW and for their continued commitment to our clients and our company.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5% or 6%, excluding TRANZACT. Adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 36.1% or 36.6% excluding TRANZACT. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.13, an increase of 9% over the prior year. For the full year, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5% or 6%, excluding TRANZACT. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 23.9%. Excluding TRANZACT, our margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $16.93, up 17% over the prior period. Our full year results reflect our strong execution against our Grow, Simplify, Transform strategic priorities, positioning us well as we entered 2025.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career revenue grew 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding TRANZACT, HWC revenue grew 6%. The full year HWC generated 4% organic growth or 5% excluding TRANZACT, which was in line with our outlook for the segment as we outlined at Investor Day.\nOur Health Business grew 18% for the quarter or 16% excluding book of business activity. All geographies achieved double-digit growth with new business and strong client retention being the primary contributors. The continued expansion of our Global Benefits Management Client Portfolio, which we discussed at Investor Day, was a meaningful driver as well. We also saw a robust consulting project activity in Europe and as expected, timing of consulting projects and commissions positively impacted our North America results. We expect Health to deliver high single-digit growth in 2025 based on our 2024 new business success in our current pipeline and sales focus.\nWealth revenue grew 3% in the fourth quarter driven by low single-digit growth in our retirement business. We saw a strong demand for LifeSight in Europe as well as consulting projects to implement legislative changes. North America also grew on the back of higher level project activity. Our investments business delivered low single-digit growth despite a strong comparable due to new business wins and successful new solutions. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in the Wealth business.\nCarrer delivered 1% revenue growth in the quarter, below our expectations. Timing limited growth in the quarter with some sold projects delayed to Q1. For the full year, Career recorded 4% organic growth, and we are confident that Career will continue growing at similar mid-single-digit levels.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing revenue declined 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding TRANZACT, BD&O revenue grew 1% with notable growth in project work Benefits Outsourcing and new client wins and retirees shopping for new plans in individual marketplace. Excluding TRANZACT, BD&O grew 2% for the full year 2024, despite facing a significant headwind from a large client that insourced its Health and Benefits administration as we've discussed in previous quarters. Looking ahead, we expect BD&O to grow at a mid-single-digit rate.\nHWC's operating margin for the fourth quarter was 41.9%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by transformation savings. For the full year, HWC's operating margin grew by 170 basis points to 29.7% and by 180 basis points, excluding TRANZACT to 31.4%. As we mentioned at Investor Day, for 2025, we expect continued margin expansion in HWC.\nMoving to Risk & Broking. Fourth quarter revenue was up 7% on an organic basis or 8% excluding book of business activity on top of a double-digit comparable in the prior year. Operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 33.5% despite an 80 basis point combined headwind from book of business activity and a decline in interest income. For the full year, Risk and Broking revenue saw 8% organic growth. Excluding the impact of book of business activity and interest income, R&B's growth rate was also 8%.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had a solid quarter, growing 6%. Excluding book of business activity and interest income, CRB revenue grew 8% on top of a double-digit comparable with contributions from all regions and driven by continued improvement in client retention levels globally and strong new business generation.\nAs Carl mentioned, our specialization strategy continues to lead the way with Facultative, Surety and Marine specialty lines having been major contributors to the strong growth performance this quarter. Robust new business activity across a wide range of lines drove growth in Great Britain and Western Europe which delivered double-digit growth as a whole and in a number of countries in the region with particular strength in Facultative, Construction, Natural Resources, Financial Solutions, FINEX, Marine and Aerospace. North America's growth was supported by strong client retention and new business growth. Our international region had strong organic growth across the board with notable double-digit increases in Latin America, Central Europe and Asia as well as many of our specialty lines.\nMoving to our Insurance Consulting and Technology business. Revenue was up 11% led by strong technology sales and modest growth in consulting services. As we discussed at Investor Day, our ongoing investment in technology is driving an intentional mix shift in ICT creating value for our clients by integrated technology and consulting solutions. Looking ahead, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit growth from both CRB and ICT.\nR&B's operating margin was 33.5% for the quarter, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to operating leverage from our organic revenue growth as well as transformation things partially offset by headwinds from book of business activity and declining interest income. As we outlined in December, we continue to expect to deliver 100 basis points of average annual adjusted operating margin expansion in R&B over the next 3 years driven by operating leverage and additional efficiencies, including the deployment of our Global Broking platform and workflow optimization.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. Adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 36.1%, a 190 basis point increase over prior year, primarily driven by greater operating leverage and continued benefits from our now completed Transformation program. We had $27 million of incremental annualized transformation savings, bringing the total to $473 million of cumulative savings since the program's inception. Foreign exchange was a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.08 for the quarter. Based on our current outlook and at current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $0.18 on adjusted EPS for 2025.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus 15.7% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.3% compared to 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be relatively consistent with that of 2024, though we do see some potential for a modestly more favorable rate.\nAs Carl mentioned, WTW completed the sale of the TRANZACT business on December 31. We believe this sale will help us sharpen our strategic focus, simplify our portfolio and accelerate our progress towards our long-term free cash flow margin goals. The transaction resulted in a pretax loss and related impairment charges of over $1 billion each, which are reflected in the full year GAAP results. These are onetime noncash charges and are not included in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated free cash flow of $0.4 billion for the full year of 2024, an increase of $184 million from prior year, primarily driven by operating margin expansion partially offset by cash outflows related to transformation and discretionary compensation payments. Given the sale of TRANZACT, the wind down of our transformation-related cash spending and expected annual margin expansion, we expect to continue expanding our free cash flow margin in 2025 with partial offsets from residual cash transformation expenses, and cash taxes on the Willis Re earn-out payment, which will be classified as cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $484 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $395 million and dividends of $89 million, bringing us to $1.26 billion in capital return to shareholders for the full year.\nBefore wrapping up, I want to take a few minutes to provide some thoughts on 2025. First, we are making some changes to our non-GAAP metrics to better reflect how we view our core operating performance and to better align with industry reporting. Starting with Q1 2025, we will exclude pension income from adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and the adjusted effective tax rate. Also, free cash flow and free cash flow margin will reflect cash outflows for capitalized software costs. Please refer to the appendix of our supplemental slides for detailed information on these upcoming changes and the recast of our historical non-GAAP measures.\nSecond, as we discussed at Investor Day in December, we are now in a position to rebalance our capital allocation approach, thanks to the success of our Growth, Simplify and Transform priorities. We intend to maintain share repurchases as the primary form of capital return and a central component of our capital allocation strategy. We expect to allocate approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchases in 2025, subject to market conditions and potential capital allocation to organic and inorganic investment opportunities. We plan to continue to invest in talent and our platform to drive sustainable growth and expand margins. We will also increasingly emphasize M&A aligned with our strategic priorities of improving our business mix expanding our reach across the insurance value chain and enhancing our margins and free cash flow.\nAs part of our investment program, we will be making initial investments in our reinsurance joint venture to support its development as a start-up venture which we expect to be a $0.25 to $0.35 headwind to adjusted EPS this year. Finally, we introduced our financial framework at Investor Day in December and have provided some financial considerations for 2025 in our release and slides, most of which I've discussed in these comments as well.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our strong business performance in 2024 and expect this momentum to continue in 2025. With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We delivered a strong second quarter, headlined by 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted diluting earnings per share of $2.55, a 24% increase over prior year and $361 million of free cash flow.\nThese healthy bottom line results were the product of our continued robust organic growth growing operating leverage across our businesses and the ongoing success of our transformation program. We are very pleased with our sustained momentum from the success of our strategic initiatives alongside continuing favorite market conditions. Our 6% organic revenue growth in the quarter represents the value proposition of our business, the impact of our investments in talent and technology and the markets we have prioritized.\nBased on our strong first half performance and our continued confidence in our outlook and execution, we have raised the low end of our 2024 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS target ranges to 23.0% to 23.5% and $16 to $17 of EPS, respectively. In addition, thanks to the success and momentum of our transformation program, we've been able to identify additional savings and accordingly, are raising our cumulative run rate transformation savings target from $425 million to $450 million by the end of 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth to achieve revenue of $9.9 billion plus.\nI'm pleased with our colleagues' focus and dedication in executing our strategic priorities. Our results and outlook reflect their hard work in delivering for our clients and driving improved productivity and efficiency. With that in mind, let me share some specifics on our recent progress and the opportunities ahead of us.\nAs I mentioned, our rising productivity drove greater operating leverage this quarter, significantly bolstering our bottom line performance. Our transformation efforts also contributed substantially to margin expansion. We achieved $24 million of incremental annualized savings this quarter, bringing the total to $394 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception.\nAs we near the end of our 3-year transformation program, we're confident that the program has positioned us for further margin expansion over the long term. We now have the organization, processes and capabilities in place to further optimize our cost structure, increase operational effectiveness and improve profitability on an ongoing basis.\nIn HWC, we continue to harness the strength of our portfolio to drive growth. We captured demand and added new clients in each of our core businesses, made many smart connections to better serve our clients' needs across different areas and introduce new breakthrough solutions. That combination enabled us to achieve 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, delivering accelerated growth across the Health, Wealth and Career businesses as we consciously manage BD&O growth to optimize earnings and cash flow.\nGrowth was led by our Health business, which generated 9% organic growth. Across the segment, we continue to see good levels of demand driven by health care inflation, strong employment, elevated pension fund status, new legislative and regulatory requirements and other complexities in the macro environment. Our deep expertise and rich experience, combined with our data analytics and software solutions position us well to help clients navigate the dynamic environment. from managing total rewards costs to derisking pension plans.\nOur teams have successfully generated billable upticks in a number of areas. We've added several new global benefits management appointments with organizations that want to better manage costs and also improve their employees' experience. With a favorable interest rate environment, we've helped more clients initiate pension derisking processes through both sums in the U.S. and the new e-buy-ins and buyouts in Great Britain.\nAs we've helped guide clients on the implications of new pay transparency and equity requirements to the EU, more companies have engaged us for broad-based award projects. In response to the strong employment market, we sold more compensation benchmarking surveys and more licenses to embark our employee experience portable. And our LifeSight master trust in Great Britain continues to grow, having just exceeded GBP 20 billion in assets under management.\nOur focus on smart connections across HWC has also continued to pay dividends. This past quarter, we worked with a large airline, which was already a global benefits management client of our Health business. This client sponsored a large number of pension plans in multiple countries and needed to help keeping these plans compliant competitive and well run. Our GBM team introduced the claim to our retirement team, which was able to provide a complete solution tailored to their retirement needs. Our strong existing relationship together with our smart connections mindset, helped us win a multiyear contract and gave our client a more developed service proposition with flexible pricing options.\nAnother example involves a large automotive retailer where we secured a health and benefits consulting and brokerage relationship to improve how their employees value and utilize their benefits, we introduced our employee experience team who presented a personalized digital approach to communication that helped the plan members break through the complexity of the health care environment. This generated an interest in learning how we could help them simplify the administration of their benefit plans. And after hearing how our teams could also collaborate to deliver insights to improve the plant's effectiveness and help them reduce overall health care costs they appointed us as their benefits outsourcer.\nIn a third example, our segments collaborated when a team at CRB reached out to our health and benefits [ in ] retirement experts. Our CRB team who've been helping a client assess and manage integration risks in a newly acquired business recognized that the client needs beyond property casualty risks to also include people risks requiring employee benefits expertise across multiple countries. We secured this win by offering complete M&A guidance, including strategic planning and brokerage services covering both corporate risk and employee benefits.\nWe've previously highlighted how HWC has developed breakthrough solutions that are leading the market and delighted to share 2 more breakthroughs this quarter. First, knowing how highly employees value flexibility members of our U.S. retirement team helped one of our clients find a way through complex regulations and potentially challenging administrative requirements to introduce a new pension plan feature to help employees better manage their financial situation. Also, our investments team launched our first ever dedicated private equity pools fund. The fund is innovative, semi-liquid structure and nature will be open to wealth and defined contribution plans.\nIn Risk and Broking, our focus on specialization, investments in talent and technology and top quality client service continues to sustain client retention rates in the mid-90s, and generate substantial growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the segment's organic revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, fueled by our specialty businesses, which continued to outpace the growth of the rest of the segment. All of this is the product of our differentiated service offerings and ability to adapt to our clients' changing and complex risks.\nOur R&B specialization strategy is about delivering tailored solutions that address industry-specific risks and optimizing our client outcome. One of our client wins this quarter included the insurance placement for an energy supplier who had a challenging loss record and complex risk profile and was under severe time constraints for securing an insurance solution. Thanks to our deep expertise in the natural resources sector across multiple geographies, we were able to provide the company with complete coverage in just 1 month.\nWe continue to make good progress with Verita, our open market MGU in North America. Submission volume continues to increase each month as the brand has expanded across the U.S. with broad opportunities from different brokers. The team continues to evaluate and add new products to the platform to further accelerate revenue growth in the second half of the year and beyond.\nAs we've mentioned, investments in our R&B talent base have also been a significant revenue growth driver for the segment. After a focused effort to replenish our talent base over the past few years, these new hires have become increasingly productive and are contributing to our strong organic growth in this segment. Our recent hiring efforts have been more opportunistic and strategic with the goal of enhancing our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and create value.\nLucy Clark, who's recently joined us is 1 example of this type of strategic hire, Lucy's commitment to specialization, data and analytics and exceptional client service makes her a perfect fit to lead risk and broking. We expect that our market presence, proven track record and focus on talent will help further drive organic growth and margin expansion in the segment, building on the excellent work Adam Gerard has accomplished over the last 5 years.\nWe are confident that our strategic investments in talent and technology, along with our specialization strategy is leading to increased engagement with both new and existing clients. This heightened activity is crucial for driving our organic revenue growth and expanding margins for the rest of the year and beyond.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their unwavering commitment to WTW and to our clients. which helped us to achieve another solid quarter. We continue to effectively execute on our strategic priorities, setting us up to achieve our objectives for the year. I'm enthusiastic about our opportunities in the second half of the year and have confidence that we are on the right path to achieving our goal for 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6% and drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 240 basis points resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.55, an increase of 24% over the prior year.\nAs Carl mentioned, thanks to our solid results for the past 2 quarters and our confidence in what we expect to achieve in the second half of the year we have raised the low end of our 2024 financial targets for adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS, bringing the target ranges to 23% to 23.5% and $16 to $17, respectively. In addition, we have been able to identify additional transformation savings and are raising our cumulative run rate target from $425 million to $450 million by the end of 2024. The total cost to achieve these savings is now estimated at $1.175 billion. These additions to the transformation program will help us drive further efficiencies as we remain focused on a strong finish to the program.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 5% compared to the second quarter of last year, in line with our expectations of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment for 2024. We noted last quarter that we expected Health revenue growth to accelerate. And indeed, the business generated revenue growth of 9% for the quarter in comparison to 3% growth in Q1.\nNorth America generated strong growth as a result of increased project work. In addition, international and Europe delivered double-digit growth driven by strong client retention, new local appointments and the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio.\nWealth grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by strong growth in our retirement business due to new client acquisitions and increased project work including pension derisking work in North America and additional work required in a peak valuation year in Great Britain. We also delivered solid growth in our Investments business due to improvements in capital markets and growth from our LifeSight solution.\nCareer delivered 4% revenue growth in the quarter, primarily driven by broad-based compensation assignments in working rewards in North America and Europe as well as projects related to communication work and employee experience. We also saw growth in our product revenue with more sales of Embark, our employee experience portal. Our compensation benchmarking participation continues to be elevated over 2023, which should lead to accelerated growth in the second half of 2024.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing was flat for the quarter. solid growth in outsourcing from increased project work more than covered the revenue headwind related to the client we mentioned last quarter, who insourced its health and other benefits administration. This growth was offset by a decrease in our Medicare-related business, where we deliberately moderated growth to reflect market developments, maximize profitability and improve free cash flow outcomes. Said differently, we do not simply chase growth at any cost in this business. HWC's operating margin was 21.9%, an increase of 360 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter, primarily driven by operating leverage and transformation savings.\nMoving to Risk & Broking, revenue was up 10% on an organic basis for the second quarter with no meaningful impact from book of business activity. Interest income was $29 million for the quarter, up $14 million from the second quarter last year. Corporate Risk & Broking had another exceptionally strong quarter with organic growth of 11%, primarily driven by higher levels of new business, strong client retention and renewal increases across all geographies.\nOur specialty lines continue to be major contributors to the strong growth performance, led globally by our facultative, construction, crisis management and Financial Solutions teams. Growth across CRB in Europe was led by financial solutions, facultative, Fenix and crisis management. North America CRB had solid growth, driven by new business and higher renewal business from crisis management, natural resources, construction, real estate, hospitality and leisure as well as health care and life sciences. Our international region had double-digit organic growth across all subregions, led by countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America.\nIn terms of rates, we see a continued improving landscape with favorable outcomes for clients. We see a stabilizing and softening market in some of our largest lines of business, such as property caused by the increasing supply of capacity from insurers. The market for financial lines continues to soften, albeit with slower rate reductions in the past quarter. An exception to that is cyber where the market is softening faster. Across those specialty lines, we see a mix, for example, in political risks and trade credit, the market is stable with some small premium rises. The same in casualty where the market remains challenged for primary risks, especially those with North America exposures.\nInsurance Consulting and Technology revenue was flat compared to prior year due to temper demand mainly in the consulting business in North America and the U.K. However, we have taken corresponding expense actions to protect our margins. we expect ICT to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nRMB's operating margin was 20.6% for the quarter, a 450 basis point increase over the prior year second quarter primarily due to operating leverage driven by solid organic revenue growth in CRB, disciplined expense management, interest income and transformation savings.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17%, a 240 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by greater operating leverage and the benefits of our transformation program. We had $24 million of incremental annualized transformation savings, bringing the total to $394 million of cumulative savings since the program's inception. The program continues to better position us to drive operating leverage going forward.\nOur unallocated net was negative $106 million for the second quarter and reflects the inclusion of a $13 million provision for significant litigation. We continue to expect the full year 2024 balance to be relatively consistent with 2023. Foreign exchange was a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.03 for the quarter. At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $0.10 on adjusted EPS for the year.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% versus 19.8% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% compared to 23.7% for the second quarter of 2023. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be close to our 2023 rate, excluding the onetime items we mentioned at year-end.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $290 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $200 million and dividends of $90 million. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value and be the central focus of balanced capital allocation. We continue to expect share repurchases to total approximately $750 million in 2024, subject to marketing conditions and other relevant factors.\nWe generated free cash flow of $361 million for the 6 months ended June 30, an increase of $11 million from prior year, primarily driven by operating margin expansion, partially offset by cash outflows related to transformation and discretionary compensation payments. The free cash flow results for the quarter are in line with our expectation as free cash flow margin was not intended to be linear for the year. We continue to be confident in our expectations of year-over-year improvement in our full year free cash flow margin.\nOur strong top line and bottom line performance this quarter reflects our ongoing momentum and the exemplary efforts of our colleagues to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We expect this to continue into the second half of the year and are confident in achieving our 2024 targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe had a solid start to the year, delivering first quarter results in line with our expectations. Our momentum from last year has carried us into 2024 as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform. Our exceptional solutions, productivity from new hires and investments in talent and technology continue to play a pivotal role in fueling organic revenue growth of 5%. Simultaneously, our transformation initiatives helped us generate adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year and 16% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nWe had $33 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the first quarter, bringing the total to $370 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. We continue to look for more opportunities to optimize the business while leveraging our cost structure to expand our margins. This encouraging start to the year, our robust new business pipeline and our plans for realizing operating efficiencies across the rest of the year, give us a high level of confidence that we will deliver on our 2024 commitments.\nI'm pleased with how our strategic progress has driven this quarter's results and more importantly, has positioned us for continued profitable growth. For the first quarter of 2024, we delivered top line growth, underscoring the heightened importance of our services in the current market. Our distinctive data-driven and industry-specific approach is making us more attuned to specific economic dynamics that allow us to enhance outcomes and mitigate risk for our clients.\nOur global client model continues to resonate with the market, thanks to our world-class offerings and the unwavering dedication of our colleagues. All this puts us in a strong position to achieve sustainable profitable growth and to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nLet me give you an update on the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead for our segments. Our specialization strategy in Risk and Broking remains a key growth driver for both the segment and the company. R&B had organic revenue growth of 8% for the quarter. Our Specialty businesses continue to strongly outpace the rest of the segment's growth. And we also continue to see sustained client retention rates in the mid-90s, the product of the ongoing value of our data and analytics focus and the effective insurance solutions that we provide to our clients.\nWe often get questions about WTW's specialist approach and how it sets us apart. What's unique about WTW's approach is that our entire business, not just the client-facing parts is structured around industry concentrations. This has clear benefits for both our clients and our operations. Clients can tap into both our global and local expertise, which includes unique data and analytical tools that help create a continuous cycle as we tackle industry challenges, aggregate our experience and information and use that to further improve our solutions to meet specific industry needs.\nFrom an operational point of view, these are businesses with national or even global P&Ls and not simply an industry practice group. Our dedicated industry teams have heightened accountability for end-to-end performance and make informed decisions based on their experience and in-depth knowledge that results in exceptional value delivered to our clients while achieving strong financial results.\nA client win from this past quarter illustrates the effectiveness of this approach. Members of our global construction line of business based in our Europe and international geographies came together to win a multiyear contract for a rail infrastructure leader, by creating a custom solution that fit the client's unique risk management profile. The global teams were assisted by our local teams in the country where the railway was being built, enabling us to provide even further specific expertise to the situation. Our team's familiarity with the industry-specific risks associated with rail infrastructure, combined with our specialized geographic knowledge ultimately secured us to win amidst fierce competition.\nIn North America, our transition to industry-focused divisions is complete, enhancing our ability to meet client needs and driving innovation and new offerings through our industry verticals. One example of this is Verita, our open market MGU, which has continued to exceed our expectations since its introduction last quarter. The recent addition of workers' compensation capabilities further solidifies Verita's proposition within the insurance ecosystem, enhancing its value proposition and is expanding its market reach. We continue to expect the investments made in talented technology over the last few years, combined with the reorientation of the R&B business towards specialization will drive higher levels of activity with new and existing clients that is fundamental to our organic revenue growth and margin expansion trajectory this year.\nIn HWC, we remain focused on our core businesses, while fostering smart connections to fuel sustainable organic growth of 4% in the quarter. Clients continue to recognize that the deep expertise we have at each of our HWC businesses enables us to deliver market-leading solutions across our Health, Wealth, Career and Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing businesses and make breakthroughs that matter in a complex and changing environment.\nFor example, with many pension plans being well funded, our retirement teams around the world have helped clients derisk their plans and gain access to surplus assets not only through traditional means like annuity buy-ins and buyouts but also through novel approaches like reopening previously closed pension plans. In addition, we've assembled a unique solution involving bulk annuity purchases at our retiree health care exchange that enables U.S. organizations to derisk retiree medical obligations. After launching this solution late last year, we've already helped clients settle some $430 million in retiree medical liabilities, and we expect another $500 million in settlements over the rest of this year.\nIn other breakthroughs, we're using artificial intelligence and broader digital tools to help clients answer some big questions about their people processes. Specifically, we've doubled our digitally enabled revenue into the career area, 2 years running, and are focused on doubling again in 2024. This includes us helping dozens of the world's largest companies identify the skills their employees need to deliver solid business results and grow in their careers.\nWe've also developed thousands of job profiles and aligned hundreds of jobs to specific career levels with AI, freeing up time for consultants so that they can spend more of their time advising clients and reward strategy and program design. Our digital solutions extended to the executive pay area with our proprietary performance modeling tool that we've deployed to help hundreds of compensation committees make decisions about executive pay and performance targets.\nStepping over to healthcare, we see no shortage of opportunities. There's continued high inflation around the world and the introduction of new Specialty solutions is not abating. Clients and prospects are looking for breakthrough to deliver value and impact, evidenced by the more than 2,500 people who recently attended our Flagship U.S. Healthcare Conference.\nAll of our core businesses are helping organizations respond to new legislation and regulation from the Netherlands Pension Legislation to the EU Pay Transparency Requirements. An important part of core business growth in HWC is the smart connections that span the segment, which create opportunities to cultivate sustainable sticky relationships. Two examples of this came with wins this past quarter with a telecommunications provider and a global biopharmaceutical company.\nIn both instances, we were able to create a comprehensive bundle of solutions by engaging our teams across working rewards, employee experience, retirement and Benefits Delivery & Administration. In addition to being simply larger, these multi-business relationships are typically more embedded and more profitable as we build connections with varied client stakeholders, deliver greater value, utilize our client knowledge and leverage common resources.\nOur focus on smart connections continues to gain traction across our segments, demonstrating the complementary nature of our businesses and providing further evidence of the value of our multi-industry expertise. For example, this past quarter, our colleagues in HWC help tee up a broking opportunity for our CRB team to do a complete review of a health and benefit clients P&C insurance strategy and programs. After detailing our approach to industry specialization, our CRB colleagues were chosen for all lines of coverage over the incumbent.\nPutting it all together, good market demand, well-positioned core businesses, breakthrough solutions in new areas and smart connections that add value, the outlook for HWC remains strong. In closing, I'm proud of our performance this quarter, which reflects our continued strategic progress. We're executing successfully at our priorities and as a result, we're in a solid position to deliver on our goals for 2024. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the rest of the year and beyond. And as always, I extend my gratitude to our colleagues for continuing to stay dedicated and committed to WTW and our clients.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we started the year on a strong note, achieving results that were in line with our expectations and position us well to achieve our 2024 targets. We remain focused on driving profitable growth through improving productivity leveraging our specialization and smart connection strategies and executing our transformation program. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5% and drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points. The result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.29, an increase of 16% over prior year.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, in line with our expectations of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in 2024.\nHealth revenue increased 3% for the quarter, led by high-single-digit growth in international and Europe and driven by the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio. Timing of new business contributed to lower growth in North America, where our business is typically fee-based. We expect that to accelerate significantly throughout the remainder of the year, in line with high-single-digit growth expectations for the full year.\nWealth grew 3% in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in our retirement business due to increased pension derisking work in North America and Europe, along with a modest increase in our Investments business due in part to new products. Career delivered 3% growth in the quarter, primarily driven by increased projects related to communication work and employee experience and more broad-based reward assignments and working reward. It is notable that in this point in the year, our compensation benchmarking participation is up double digits over 2023, creating a pipeline for accelerated growth in the latter half of 2024.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 6% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies in our individual marketplace business. Based on the incidence of growth projected by carriers in the Medicare Advantage space, we expect more moderated growth later in the year. Offsetting the BDA growth was low growth in our outsourcing business as we absorbed a revenue headwind due to a large client in-sourcing its health and other benefits administration.\nHWC's operating margin was 25.1%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily driven by transformation savings. Risk and Broking revenue was up 8% on an organic basis for the first quarter. There was a $5 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from book of business activity. Interest income was $28 million for the quarter, up $16 million from the first quarter last year.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter, growing 9% or 10% excluding the impact of book-of-business activity primarily driven by strong client retention across all geographies and higher level of new business activity. Our specialty lines continue to be a major contributor to the strong growth performance led globally by financial solutions and natural resources. Growth across CRB in Europe was led by Financial Solutions, Aerospace, Natural Resources, Marine and P&C.\nNorth America CRB had solid growth driven by new business across several lines, including Construction, Natural Resources and Real Estate, Hospitality and Leisure as well as contributions from our new Verita business. Our international region also contributed strong organic growth across all subregions, led by countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nLooking at the insurance industry more broadly in terms of rates, the market remains a bit mixed with some flattening and even softening in specific insurance lines such as D&O and cyber. However, the current risk environment is marked by increased frequency in natural disasters, social inflation and geopolitical conflicts. And as a result of that, we see rate increases across various lines such as casualty, especially in North America, and globally in political violence and terrorism.\nInsurance Consulting & Technology revenue was flat with prior year due to the timing of consulting and technology revenue between quarters. We expect ICT to achieve mid- to high-single-digit growth for the full year and in line with our overall expectations for Risk and Broking. R&B's operating margin was 20.8% for the quarter, a 90-basis-point increase over the prior year first quarter, primarily due to interest income, transformation savings and solid organic revenue growth in CRB. R&B also faced margin headwinds this quarter from the impact of book of business activity as well as foreign exchange.\nIn addition, as we mentioned at year-end, now that our talent base in R&B is back to full strength, we are focused on strategic and opportunistic talent investments with industry expertise as well as investments in technology that will eventually yield more revenue than what is currently in the mix. These investments impacted R&B's margins this quarter. However, they will enhance our presence and capabilities in the lines of business and geographies that we believe offer the greatest growth and profitability potential.\nWe continue to expect margin expansion on a full year basis and as we mentioned last quarter, given the business' seasonality and uncertain pacing of our investments, the scale of R&B margin expansion may vary from quarter-to-quarter, but should improve over the course of the year.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.6%, a 200-basis-point increase over prior year. The benefits of our transformation program drove a large part of our margin expansion for the quarter alongside improved operating leverage. We had $33 million of incremental annualized transformation savings for the quarter, bringing the total to $370 million since the program's inception. The benefits this program provides will better position us to drive sustainable operating leverage going forward.\nOur unallocated net was negative $56 million for the first quarter. We continue to expect the full year 2024 balance to be relatively consistent with 2023. Foreign exchange did not have a meaningful impact on adjusted EPS for the quarter, at current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a headwind of approximately $0.05 on adjusted EPS for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.9% versus 19.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 20.5% for the first quarter of 2023. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be close to our 2023 rate, excluding the onetime tax items we mentioned last quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $187 million to our shareholders with share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $86 million. We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy and currently view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We continue to expect approximately $750 million of share repurchases in 2024, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors.\nOur interest expense for the quarter was $64 million versus $54 million in the first quarter of 2023. We actively managed our leverage profile by issuing $750 million of new debt in March. A portion of those proceeds will be used to pay our upcoming $650 million debt maturity in June.\nWe generated free cash flow of negative $9 million for the first quarter, a decline of $101 million from the prior year, primarily driven by increased cash outflows related to transformation and discretionary compensation payments partially offset by higher inflows from collections. The free cash flow results for the quarter are in line with what we planned as free cash flow margin was not intended to be a linear path for the year. We continue to be confident in our expectations of year-over-year improvement in our full year free cash flow margin.\nOur results this quarter were a solid start to 2024, and reflect a continuation of the significant progress we have been making on our strategy and operational performance. We expect our momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and are confident in achieving our 2024 targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWTW ended 2023 on a strong note and has begun 2024 with solid momentum as we continue to execute on our grow, simplify and transform strategic priorities. In the fourth quarter, our world-class solutions and maturing investments in talent helped generate robust organic revenue growth.\nAnd our transformation program and expense discipline drove adjusted operating margin expansion and solid adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. Our performance steadily improved throughout 2023. And today, WTW is stronger, more resilient and better positioned to achieve our goals.\nWe delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 34.2%, up 180 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.44, an 18% increase year-over-year.\nFor the full year, we had organic revenue growth of 8% above our mid-single-digit target. We also drove 110 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 22%, fulfilling our commitment of annual margin expansion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $14.49, an 8% increase over the prior year.\nWe believe these results are the product of our strong global client model, our strategic investments in talent and technology and our team's hard work and relentless focus on best-in-class delivery.\nThe progress we see within WTW and the enthusiastic response we're receiving from clients give us confidence that our strategies, our people and our investments are aligned with areas that we believe to be the greatest opportunities to drive sustainable profitable growth and create shareholder value over the long term.\nLet me take a few minutes to share the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead of us across our segments. Throughout 2023, our specialization strategy in Risk & Broking was a key driver of growth for both the segment and the enterprise. Our specialty businesses continue to have significantly higher growth in the rest of the segment. This growth, driven in large part by improved client retention, expansion of existing client relationships and our strength and ability to attract new clients and win back old ones has validated our approach.\nAs a result, specialization continues to be our primary strategic focus in R&B. It allows us to create value for clients by tailoring solutions that close gaps in their risk management profile. Together with digitization, data and analytics, we can create efficiencies that enable us to provide more timely and effective insurance services.\nOur approach to specialization is tailored to each geography in which we operate. In 2023, we built out 12 industry verticals in North America. That process is now complete, with colleagues, processes and infrastructure supporting that alignment. Given the success we've seen to date, we're in the process of launching this industry model across Western Europe, and we'll build out more industry verticals in our international region in 2024.\nThis model, together with our global reach, has us positioned to win an outsized share of complex mandates such as our recent win of a multiyear construction project for a key player in the European energy sector. Our cutting-edge data and analytics and our ability to bring together superior industry and product expertise from our specialist teams across several countries set our proposal apart.\nWe're also making good progress expanding into new and differentiated revenue streams such as our new managing general underwriter, Verita, which is growing steadily since its initial launch in September.\nJust in the fourth quarter of 2023, we've onboarded brokers, [ balanced ] premiums and received submissions for both external and our own brokerage clients.\nIn 2024, we'll focus on expanding our MGA and MGU strategy to additional geographies. In addition to expanding our business platforms and offerings at Risk & Broking, we're continuing to invest in our people to win new business. Our colleagues who joined us during 2022 and 2023 have become increasingly productive and have brought our talent base back to full strength, as evidenced by the segment's strong organic revenue growth in the second half of 2023.\nAccordingly, we're now focused on strategic and opportunistic talent investments. These investments should enhance our presence capabilities in the lines of business and geographies that we believe offer the greatest growth and profitability potential. We expect these efforts to continue throughout 2024 and beyond.\nFurthermore, we see opportunity for continued strong new business growth as we work closely to help clients manage a complex and challenging risk environment marked by increasingly costly natural disasters, social inflation and geopolitical conflicts.\nIn HWC, we've leveraged the strength of our portfolio, driving growth through and across health, wealth and career and BD&O. We've made significant progress by staying focused on our core businesses by making connections across the organization where it adds value for clients and by simplifying how we work. For example, we maintained or improved client retention rates across all of HWC, including excellent 98% retention rates for our retirement and outsourcing businesses.\nWe had a dozen of clients for our signature packaged solutions like our LifeSight master trust and global benefits management offerings. We expanded our relationships with more than 1,500 clients to include at least one new service offering. And we increased the size and scope of our hub teams in key centers around the world to enhance capacity and consistency.\nOur intense focus on cross-selling and making it simpler to do business with us is paying off. Across industries and services, more clients are coming to WTW for a full suite of solutions. Just to mention a few from this quarter. We had a software development firm move its global benefits consulting and brokerage work to WTW and appoint us to support their employee experience through our Embark portal and our Engage software.\nA major global financial corporation's simple survey request turned into a multiyear engagement for us that includes supporting the client with attracting and pertaining talent and the delivery of a fully integrated total reward solution using one of our portals. And we leveraged our existing pension actuarial and outsourcing relationships with a leading regional health system into support for a rollout of major changes to their health and benefits program, which include the creation of a temporary health and welfare service center.\nWe're confident HWC will provide a solid foundation for growth in 2024. And as we've discussed on prior calls, complexity in the human capital landscape continues to increase and finding the right solutions to our clients' unique needs in this environment requires a holistic, integrated and consultative approach. Our ability to move quickly and deliver the right resources at speed helps our clients take advantage of changing conditions and creates meaningful opportunities for HWC.\nI'll highlight 2 trends we see as tailwinds for 2024. In our health business, clients are continuing to look for ways to address the increasing cost of health care around the world. They're to us for help with more effective plan management and specialty solutions that can improve their population health status. And in our retirement business, clients are increasingly looking to capitalize on the change in the rate environment by derisking their pension plans through annuity buy-ins and buyouts.\nWith the funded status of the largest U.S. corporate pension plans having ended 2023 at 100%, we expect this trend will support growth in that business during 2024.\nWe also expect our growing momentum with smart connections this quarter to continue into 2024 and also extends to cross-selling between our 2 segments. We continue to arm all our colleagues with a solid understanding of our full range of services and the tools to identify and facilitate cross-segment opportunities.\nTwo large client wins in the fourth quarter illustrate the power of this approach, a P&C insurance solution is a major media company that originated with one of our retirement colleagues and a multiyear health benefits design, administration and broking engagement that began with a benefits review arranged by a CRB column. The progress we've made in enhancing our growth engines at HWC and R&B over the past 2-plus years is also enabling us to drive increased margin expansion.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we saw a continuing improvement in productivity and a tightened focus on cost discipline. Similarly, our transformation program continues to drive a significant benefit to our bottom line, enabling us to finish the year strong and to lay the foundation for another year of adjusted operating margin expansion.\nWe realized $37 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to $337 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. Thanks to the success and momentum of the program, we have been able to identify additional savings and accordingly, are raising our cumulative run rate transformation savings target from $380 million to $425 million by the end of 2024.\nLooking ahead, we're confident that we're on the right path to achieve our 2024 targets of continued mid-single-digit organic revenue growth leading to at least $9.9 billion in total revenue, adjusted operating margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.40 to $17 and additional improvement in our free cash flow margin. Andrew will touch on our 2024 guidance in more detail shortly.\nIn closing, our performance in 2023 reflected our hard work to grow, simplify and transform our business over the past 2-plus years. I'm proud of the progress we've made and excited about the opportunities ahead. Based on our momentum and our healthy pipeline, I'm confident we can deliver continued sustainable and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication, service and continued commitment to our clients and to WTW.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we finished the year with strong momentum, putting us in a solid position to achieve our 2024 targets, and I'd like to share some further details on our financial results.\nWe delivered organic revenue growth of 6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year growth rate to 8%. The ramp-up in productivity of our investment hires, our specialization strategy and Risk & Broking and the ongoing demand for our benefits and human capital services in HWC continue to fuel the strong top line growth. Alongside this robust growth, we also drove margin expansion for both the quarter and full year at the enterprise level and in each of our segments. The result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.44 for the quarter and $40.49 for the year.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth & Career generated revenue growth of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and finished the year with 6% growth.\nGoing into 2024, we feel confident in the outlook and expect another year of similarly positive results for the segment. Revenue for health increased 6% for the quarter or 5% when excluding the impact of some modest book of business activity. We delivered solid growth across all regions driven by increased brokerage income and the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio in Europe and international. Wealth grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Retirement growth was driven by increased project work related to derisking activity in North America as well as additional project work in the pension brokerage in Europe.\nInvestments also contributed significantly to growth for the quarter, reflecting new client acquisitions and higher fees. Career delivered 6% growth in the quarter, driven by increased compensation survey sales, executive compensation and Board advisory services and project work related to employee experience. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 3% growth in the quarter. The increase was be driven by higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies in our individual marketplace business and increased project activity and benefits outsourcing.\nHWC's operating margin increased 150 basis points compared to the prior fourth quarter to 40.5%, primarily driven by transformation savings. For the full year, HWC's operating margin increased 190 basis points over prior year to 28%. Risk & Broking revenue was up an exceptional 12% on an organic basis for the fourth quarter.\nInterest income was $27 million for the quarter, up $17 million from the fourth quarter last year. Note that beginning with Q1 2024 results, we plan to include the impact of investment income on organic growth at the segment and enterprise levels in our materials.\nFor the full year, Risk & Broking grew 10% organically. We are expecting mid-single digit or better organic revenue growth for the segment in 2024, with continued contributions from our investments in talent and platforms as we identify and pursue opportunities in line with our specialization strategy.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter, growing 12% and continuing the organic revenue growth trajectory we have seen in the business over the last couple of quarters. Higher levels of new business activity, improved client retention and increased renewable revenue from rate increases drove robust organic revenue growth.\nOur specialty lines continue to be major contributors to the strong growth performance, led globally by natural resources, facultative, ‘FINEX’ Financial Solutions, crisis management and construction. Strong growth across CRB in Europe was led by P&C retail, facultative, Natural Resources and FINEX. North America CRB benefited from strong new business in construction, Natural Resources, marine, aerospace, real estate and hospitality and leisure as we saw strong demand in the industries in which we specialize.\nOur international region also contributed with exceptional organic growth, including strong growth across all subregions led by Latin America. In the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 8% over the prior year period on top of a strong comparable, driven by increased sales in Technology Solutions, including strong new business and higher project activity. R&B's operating margin was 32.9% for the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over the prior year fourth quarter.\nWe continue to see our hiring efforts yield strong results and rising productivity, driving greater operating leverage. The margin also benefited from transformation, continued expense discipline and tailwinds from increased interest income, partially offset by some modest foreign exchange activity and investments in people and technology platforms.\nFor the full year, R&B's operating margin increased 60 basis points over prior year to 21.8%. As Carl mentioned, we plan to continue to opportunistically invest in talent and strategic initiatives in this segment in line with our previous announcement.\nFor 2024, we continue to expect margin expansion on a full year basis. Given the business seasonality and uncertain pacing of the investments, please note that the scale of R&B margin expansion may vary from quarter-to-quarter. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 34.2%, a 180 basis point increase over prior year. For the full year, we saw 110 basis points of margin improvement to 22%.\nThe benefits of our transformation program drove a large part of our margin expansion for the year. We had $37 million of incremental annualized transformation savings for the fourth quarter, bringing the total of $337 million since the program's inception.\nAs Carl mentioned, we are raising our transformation savings target to $425 million by the end of 2024. The additional savings will primarily come from technology modernization and process optimization which we expect to further reduce our cost structure and help unlock additional long-term growth and cost savings opportunities.\nThe total amount of cost to achieve is now estimated at $1.125 billion. Along with their direct return on investment, these additions to the transformation program will serve as a catalyst for additional improvement by creating an infrastructure from which to drive further efficiencies.\nOur unallocated net was $296 million for the full year 2023, an increase of $31 million over prior year, primarily due to a headwind from a onetime favorable item reflected in the prior year balance. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 tailwind on adjusted EPS for the quarter and a $0.06 headwind for the year. At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS for 2024 with no impact in Q1.\nWe recorded $109 million in pension income for 2023, relatively in line with our expectations. For 2024, we expect $88 million in pension income with the decrease driven by market performance and interest rate movements.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.7% versus 17.7% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.1% compared to 22.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the year was 16.8% versus 15.4% in the prior year. And lastly, our adjusted tax rate for the year was 20.9%, consistent with prior year.\nNotably, there were nonrecurring items in Q4, which resulted in onetime tax items in our 2023 adjusted tax rate. Excluding these benefits, our adjusted tax rate would have been 22.4%, and our adjusted diluted EPS would have been $14.22. We expect our full year adjusted tax rate in 2024 to be closer to our 2023 adjusted tax rate, excluding these onetime benefits.\nIn 2023, we returned nearly $1.4 billion to our shareholders with share repurchases of $1 billion and dividends of $352 million. We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy and currently view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We expect to continue repurchasing our shares in 2024 under our current share repurchase authority of which approximately $1.3 billion remains. We expect approximately $750 million of share repurchases in 2024, subject to market conditions, among other relevant factors.\nWe generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion in 2023, representing a free cash flow margin of 12.6%, above our target of 12%. The improvement from the prior year was driven by the nonrecurrence of onetime headwinds reflected in the comparable period, operating margin expansion and improvement in TRANZACT's cash flow. These improvements were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nTurning to our 2024 financial targets. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth as we work towards our revenue goal of $9.9 billion-plus. We expect our adjusted operating margin to expand toward the high end of the 22.5% to 23.5% range. We also expect to deliver on our adjusted diluted earnings per share target of $15.40 to $17. Finally, we expect incremental improvement in our free cash flow margin.\nOur results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 are a testament to our continued strategic progress, our operational execution and our colleagues' relentless focus on serving our clients. We are very pleased with our performance and expect our momentum to continue into 2024 as we focus on delivering on our targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We had a strong third quarter, delivering 9% organic revenue growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.24, maintaining our top line momentum as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.\nExcluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 10%. This solid result was fueled by the great efforts of our colleagues, the strength of our global client model, the investments we've made in talent and technology and the resiliency of our business. Notably, our bottom line performance this quarter was driven by 170 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion.\nThe positive impacts of both our recent cost saving measures and the growing productivity of our new hires led to a strong finish for the quarter. Additionally, we realized $23 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the third quarter. This brings the total to $300 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception.\nWe are well positioned for further adjusted operating margin expansion over the long term, driven by organic revenue growth from our unique offerings and strategic hires, the continued progress of our transformation program and a strengthened focus on cost discipline.\nIn the near term, we expect year-over-year margin expansion for the fourth quarter and the full year as a result of operating leverage and increasing contributions from our expense management initiatives. We're pleased with our third quarter performance and our progress gives us confidence in our ability to drive profitable growth and create value over the long term.\nAs I touched on last quarter, our focus on specialization in our Risk & Broking segment has been one of the key drivers of our strong organic growth. We've generated substantial momentum by developing innovative products and services, engaging in strategic partnerships, and building platforms like MGAs, MGUs and affinity products. For example, one of our major client wins for the quarter included an affinity solution that delivers compelling insurance products via digital channels to customers of a major manufacturer of luxury vehicles. This showcased our specialized expertise in the automotive industry and high net worth personal lines of business as well as our successful track record in global affinity insurance programs.\nOur strategic focus on specialization continues to drive strong growth in our specialty lines, which continue to grow much faster than our average R&B growth. As we've mentioned last quarter, based on the strong market response we've seen to date, we're expanding our pursuit of these initiatives. For example, we recently announced that WTW will launch Verita, a new MGU focused on select industries which will further advance our specialization strategy and risk and broking in North America. Verita will initially focus on the industry verticals of real estate, hospitality and leisure, financial institutions and professional services.\nOur deep knowledge of these industries together with our insurance expertise will enable Verita to have a comprehensive understanding of our clients' risks. This will allow us to offer best-in-class holistic insurance solutions while maintaining underwriting discipline.\nThe target customers for Verita are growing companies seeking more flexible, tailored insurance solutions. And overtime, we aim to expand Verita into more industries as we grow the platform.\nOur analytic tools and expertise in insurance advisory and brokerage give our clients confidence that they're getting the best value for their premium dollars. This quarter, our portfolio was expanded to include the global actuarial review for a leading P&C insurer and the brokerage of a global renewal energy program by a world-class player in the energy sector.\nData analytics and specialty expertise are also key growth drivers for our Health, Wealth and Career segment. For example, we've had record success for our compensation benchmarking participation in sales with more than 43,000 companies participating in our surveys at the end of September. And we've introduced new talent intelligence reports, which examine hot skills and high-demand jobs across industries to help our clients make better informed decisions on work and rewards issues.\nWe've also continued to build our health care benchmarking and specialty services. Earlier this year, we enhanced our pharmacy offering with an expansion of our Rx Collaborative and a new product for mid-market organizations. This past quarter, we launched 2 new pharmacy partnerships to help plan members save on costs. Another key to our HWC success is the differentiated smart connections we're making across businesses and geographies. A client's simple request for data can lead to additional consulting opportunities for us. It's also done to enhance our solution systematically.\nOur updated workforce management offering, which combines financial analysis, health assessment and communication tools is but one example that led to millions of dollars of incremental revenue this past quarter. Another example is our LifeSight solution, our defined contribution pooled employer plan. We've expanded LifeSight to the U.S. earlier this year and are pleased to report that we've contracted with our first U.S. client while we added clients with $2.5 billion of asset value in Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium.\nAcross WTW, the confluence of innovation and collaboration is driving consistent, sustainable growth. I'm energized by how our journey to 1 WTW is increasingly delivering new opportunities made possible by bringing together our diverse capabilities. Finally, I want to touch on capital allocation. As we've said in the past, we'll continue to take a balanced approach with a focus on allocating our capital to the highest return opportunities.\nIn the third quarter, we bought back $350 million of stock and expanded our repurchase authorization, demonstrating that share repurchases remain our top priority.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, I'm encouraged by the strong client response to the hard work we've done growing, simplifying and transforming our business. We continue to see momentum building as our unique offerings help clients evaluate and manage their risks and opportunities in a complex macro environment. We are committed to harnessing this momentum to drive greater operating leverage over time. We believe that our transformation program and disciplined expense management, combined with consistent and sustainable growth opportunities will support near-term and long-term margin expansion.\nI want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter. I'm truly appreciative of their dedication, service and continued commitment to our vision. Now before turning it over to Andrew, I'd also like to acknowledge the escalating conflict in the Middle East, the violence, devastation, loss of life and impact on innocent civilians are profoundly saddening. Our primary focus in times of tragedy is on the safety of our colleagues and their families. Thankfully, our colleagues who work in the region continue to be safe. We remain in regular contact and are providing the assistance they need. We support all of our colleagues and clients as well as their friends and family in the region as they cope with this difficult situation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, our third quarter revenue was up 9% on an organic basis. And excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth would have been 10%. This growth reflects the increasing productivity of our new hires and the impact of our strategic focus on specialization and risk and broking and increased demand from clients seeking solutions to manage the impact of inflation on health care costs, pensions, retirement plans and human capital in HWC.\nI'm very pleased with the progress of our transformation program, which delivered $23 million of incremental annualized savings during the third quarter. This brings the total to $151 million in cumulative annualized savings this year. Our progress on the transformation program and our strength and focus on cost management will help us drive continued operating leverage.\nI will now discuss our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 9% on an organic basis and 8% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year. We feel confident in our pipeline and anticipate that the segment will finish off the year with good results and in line with historical trends.\nRevenue for health increased 7% for the quarter or 8% without considering the impact of book of business activity. We delivered solid growth across all regions, driven by the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio, new local clients, expanding consulting work for existing clients and increased brokerage income.\nWealth grew 7% in the third quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to strong momentum in return with increased derisking activity and consulting work in North America. Retirement also grew in Europe as a result of derisking work, regulatory compliance support and pension brokerage. Investments grew as a result of new client acquisitions and higher fees, which more than offset headwinds from the negative impact of capital market performance. Career delivered 8% growth in the quarter, driven by increased compensation survey sales, executive compensation work and other word-based advisory services, including paid transparency work, and change communication services.\nBenefits delivery and outsourcing generated 14% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by strength in outsourcing for new clients and increased compliance and other project activity and individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of life and Medicare Advantage policies.\nAs a reminder, we typically generate about 50% of the revenue for our individual marketplace business during the fourth quarter, and we expect the growth next quarter to be relatively in line with historical trends. HWC's operating margin increased 350 basis points from the prior year third quarter to 23.8%. This margin increase was attributable to both improved operating leverage and transformation savings. Operating leverage was driven by a positive spread with revenue outpacing expense growth and some timing between quarters.\nRisk & Broking revenue was up 10% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the prior year third quarter. Excluding the $10 million year-over-year impact from book of business activity, risk and broking grew at an exceptional 12%.\nAs a reminder, there were about $10 million of book of business sales in R&B in the fourth quarter of 2022. We currently expect a similar amount of book of business settlements next quarter, and therefore, do not expect a meaningful year-over-year impact from book of business activity in Q4. However, the timing for settlements can be difficult to predict and may drag into the following year.\nCorporate Risk and Broking had another strong quarter delivering organic revenue growth of 10% and continuing the positive growth trajectory we have seen over recent quarters. Excluding book of business activity, CRB grew at 12%. This result was primarily driven by strong new business growth and improved client retention. Pricing had a moderate positive impact on the quarter.\nInterest income was up $19 million for the quarter due to higher rates and the reclassification of interest income previously recorded in corporate. As noted last quarter, due to the cessation of the co-broking agreement with Gallagher, interest income directly associated with risk and broking fiduciary funds is now allocated to the segment.\nThe exceptional growth in Q3 was also driven by continued strong return on investment in our specialty lines. Globally, the strongest growth came from our facultative financial solutions, natural resources, surety and construction lines of business.\nEurope had an exceptional quarter with double-digit growth in a number of countries led by our P&C retail and direct business as well as construction, aerospace and financial solutions. International also contributed to strong organic growth led by Latin America.\nNorth America benefited from strong new business and increased client retention across most lines of business despite headwinds in our M&A business and from the impact of book of business activity.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 9% over the prior year period, driven by increased sales in technology solutions, including strong new business and higher project activity. R&B's operating margin was 15.7% for the third quarter, an increase of 200 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter. The expected ramp-up in production from our strategic hiring efforts drove greater operating leverage while tailwinds from increased interest income were offset by headwinds from gain on sale activity and foreign currency.\nIncreased contribution from transformation as well as targeted expense management measures we put in place earlier this year also contributed meaningfully to margin expansion. We are beginning to see our expense management actions deliver results including coordinated efforts on reducing spend for internal travel and vendor spend. We continue to expect these actions to benefit our margin next quarter.\nTurning back to enterprise level results. Our adjusted operating margin was 16.2%, a 170 basis point increase over prior year. Excluding book of business activity, the margin would have increased 220 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from transformation savings as well as the impact of interest income. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.24.\nForeign exchange had a minimal impact on EPS for the third quarter. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we now expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.07 for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.5% versus 0.7% in the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 16.8% in the prior year reflecting the nonrecurring nature of discrete tax benefits reflected in the prior year rate. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be modestly above the prior year.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in what we believe to be the highest return opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we paid $88 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $350 million. As Carl mentioned, we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. Last month, we raised our repurchase authorization by $1 billion of which approximately $1.5 billion remains. In the first half of the year, we had about $450 million of share repurchases. We expect a similar amount for the second half of the year, subject to market conditions, among other relevant factors.\nAdditionally, we repaid $250 million of debt that matured during the quarter with a portion of the proceeds from our May debt issuance. Year-to-date, we have generated free cash flow of $707 million compared to free cash flow of $337 million during the same period in the prior year. The improvement of $370 million was due to the nonrecurrence of prior year headwinds, including realized losses on foreign currency hedges, payments made in the prior year for certain discretionary compensation and taxes for onetime gains recorded in connection with the Willis Retail and the deal termination payment. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nWe are very pleased with our improving business performance and expect this momentum to continue for the rest of the year. I am very proud of the leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues and the continued support of our clients. Our investments in talent, innovation and operational transformation have helped drive organic revenue growth, and we are confident that this will translate into sustained growth in margins, EPS and free cash flow.\nAnd with that, let's open it up for Q&A."

For reconsiliation of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We continue to see our strategic initiatives resonate strongly in the marketplace as reflected in the 7% organic revenue growth we recorded in the second quarter. This solid result reflected continued strong growth across our entire portfolio of businesses despite significant challenges from outsized book of business sales in each of our segments in the prior year. Excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 9%. We're very encouraged by the sustained top line momentum and the positive response we've seen from clients to our investments in talented technology across all our businesses.\nAt the same time, we faced margin headwinds from those investments as well as wage inflation in prior year book sales that limited our progress on driving margin expansion and earnings growth this quarter. The continued success of our transformation program, which exceeded our expectations yet again partially offset these headwinds. All in all, adjusted operating margin declined by 90 basis points for the quarter, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.05. Though we had a decline in adjusted operating margin this quarter, as we've said before, our progress in margin expansion won't always be linear. However, we don't expect margin declines in any full year period.\nEarlier this morning, we reset our 2024 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS targets. These updates reflect our margin and earnings performance to date and as we've called out in the previous quarters, the Pension Income headwinds that based on current market conditions, we do not expect to subside. Importantly, they also include our current assessment of the opportunities we see ahead of us with the benefit of being halfway through our 3-year plan. We lowered our 2024 target for adjusted operating margin to 22.5% to 23.5% from 23% to 24%. While some of the change stems from the slower pace at which we generate operating leverage, it primarily reflects our opportunistic decision to further invest in talent and other key strategic initiatives, especially in our Risk & Broking segment. This incremental investment will further strengthen our long-term market position and drive continued strong organic growth beyond the 2024 forecast period.\nTo elaborate a bit on that decision, I want to say a few words about where our R&D segment stands today and the opportunity going forward. Our differentiated service offering, underpinned by our ability to adapt to our clients' changing needs creates an incredibly compelling value proposition and the success of this strategy in R&B so far is evident through the strong organic growth we've been able to deliver. Our focus on specialization, innovation and top quality client service has generated substantial momentum and opportunities we did not have 18 months ago.\nEarlier this month, our Aerospace team won back the Airbus account, one of the largest in the sector on the back of our strengthened value proposition. And that success is not just happening in aerospace, our global lines of business, such as P&C, Marine and Financial solutions have continued to deliver meaningfully above market growth, including double-digit growth in the second quarter. In North America, the build-out of 12 identified industry divisions continues at pace with colleagues and infrastructure being aligned, and we expect most of this to be completed by year-end. Our traction in the marketplace has shown us there are even more opportunities here to deliver solid organic growth well into the future.\nBut a 6th strategy is simply not an option in today's ever-changing risk landscape. To capitalize on these opportunities and meet client-specific needs, we're continuing to advance our specialization strategy and develop innovative products and services, which will distinguish us in a way to best attract clients and talent. This requires developing differentiated offerings, increasing strategic partnerships and expanding our reach through platforms like MGAs, MGUs and affinity products. Of course, high-quality talent is essential to drive these initiatives and turn our vision into a reality. And we see our rejuvenated strategy and independent brand become a load start for that talent, which will further fuel our success.\nWe do appreciate the need to strike a balance between investing for incremental growth in the long term and capturing savings in the near term. While this investment in talent will partially offset the savings from our transformation program and tailwinds from higher investment income and lower pension service costs between now and 2024, we expect these efforts will drive greater operating leverage over the long term as productivity improves and we realize more efficiency from increased scale. Running a successful business is never a straight line. It's a journey filled with triumph and challenges, and we've experienced both over the last 18 months.\nOn one hand, the operating margin has benefited from our accelerated progress on the transformation program, interest income has been higher and our pension-related service costs have been more favorable than originally expected. At the same time, macroeconomic conditions have dampened demand for interest rate-sensitive businesses, such as M&A, and the inflationary environment has put pressure on our operating costs, driving up wages and travel and entertainment. We are also focused on implementing cost-saving measures primarily focused on eliminating nonessential travel. While we've seen some progress in generating margin expansion from R&B, we know there is more to do, we remain confident that the right path to delivering margin expansion includes both driving organic revenue growth through our strategic investments and executing on transformation program savings and efficiency measures.\nAs a core part of our strategic decision to invest further in our specialization strategy and our talent base, we are excited to welcome Lucy Clark as the global leader of Risk & Broking in the third quarter of 2024. Lucy's committed to specialization, exceptional client service and data and analytics, all directly aligned with WTW's competitive advantages and what we're doing in this space, making her the right person to accelerate the execution of our strategy. She has extraordinary market presence, a proven track record of delivering operational and financial results and an intense focus on talent. We are delighted she is being our team, and I look forward to welcoming Lucy to our team in the third quarter of 2024. Until then, Adam Garrad will continue to lead the segment. And after Lucy's arrival, Adam will become the Chairman of Risk & Broking.\nNow let me shift gears back to our updated 2024 adjusted EPS target. The revised target of $15.40 to $17 reflects the sizable pension income headwinds we've discussed on previous calls, a modestly higher expected tax rate and the lower adjusted operating margin. The revised target also reflects a more narrow and precise range than our original figures given that we're halfway through our target period of 3 years. I've already talked about the drivers behind our margins. So let me take a minute to cover the other 2 items. The most significant driver influencing our change to our EPS target is a sizable decline in expected pension income since we set our original 2024 target almost 2 years ago. We originally expected Pension Income to contribute $2 to $2.50 to adjusted EPS. As we've communicated previously, the increase in interest rates and decline in capital market returns have created significant headwinds to Pension Income dynamics. As a result, we now expect Pension Income to contribute $0.35 to $0.85, less than half of our original estimate to adjusted EPS in 2024. The change in expected pension income accounts for approximately $1.55 of the overall change in EPS target. We continue to expect Pension Income of $112 million in 2023 and we'll update you on our 2024 pension expectations during our fourth quarter call after the remeasurement process.\nThe second driver impacting the EPS target change stems from the modest increase in tax rate due to our updated estimates of future tax rates based on legislative changes. We expect the U.K. corporate tax rate increase will have a modest impact starting in 2023. While we continue to evaluate the OECT/G20 guidance on the Pillar 2 global minimum tax released earlier this year, we expect the legislative changes may further increase the rate in 2024 and forward.\nNow before I hand it over to Andrew, I want to step back for a moment and reflect on the progress of WTW since the tumult of 2021. In 2021, WTW had $9 billion of revenue and adjusted operating margin of 19.9% and EPS of $11.60. And the full impact of the termination of the business combination was not reflected in the company's financial results in that time. That occurred in 2022 when organic growth slowed, book of business sale activity spiked, and we need to make substantial investment in both talent and transformation-related activities to position the company for future growth. Since that time, we've stabilized our business, we build our talent base, significantly strengthened organic revenue growth, optimize capital management return significant capital to shareholders and are transforming and simplifying our company to drive greater profitability. We are in a far better place from where we started.\nWe remain committed to our strategic priorities of Grow, Simplify and Transform and we are delivering meaningful strategic progress against these initiatives. We can see their contributions to our performance, including organic growth in line with our payers and $277 million of transformation savings. We remain committed to improving our core operating results to reach our revised 2024 goals and drive long-term earnings growth. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and performance this quarter. We are truly appreciative of their continued dedication to our vision and their relentless focus on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before we delve into the financials, I want to provide some additional color on our free cash flow to help paint a clearer picture of our core free cash flow performance and our outlook. First, I want to explain why we are focused on free cash flow margin or free cash flow as a percentage of revenue rather than some of the other potential metrics. The noncash nature of our pension income can distort various free cash flow conversion calculations, whether you're calculating free cash flow conversion as a percentage of net income, adjusted net income or adjusted EBITDA. We, therefore, think free cash flow as a percentage of revenue or free cash flow margin is a clearer and more meaningful metric to track free cash flow.\nNext, I'd like to remind you of the nonrecurring items that impacted our 2022 cash flow performance. In 2022, our free cash flow margin decreased to 8%, reflecting strong revenue growth and margin expansion partially offset by some significant nonrecurring items, including delayed cash tax payments for the 2021 gains recorded in connection with the sale of Willis Re and the deal termination fee, realized losses on foreign currency hedges and onetime retention and executive compensation costs. Adjusted for these onetime headwinds, our 2022 free cash flow margin would have been approximately 14%. We consider this a normalized baseline for 2022. Adding the approximately 200 basis point increase in transformation-related spend for 2023 and gets us to approximately 12% free cash flow margin, which we think is a reasonable guidepost for 2023.\nLooking beyond 2023, we expect to see free cash flow margin increase driven by improved cash conversion in our TransAct business and the abatement of transformation-related spend. Collectively, these items are expected to contribute over 400 basis points to our free cash flow margin over the long term. Starting from the 12% free cash flow margin expected for 2023 this expansion in free cash flow margin on top of our expected organic revenue growth should drive strong long-term growth in free cash flow. Additionally, we expect incremental upside driven by improved profitability and working capital improvement actions. Thus, we think 16% plus is a reasonable long-term guidepost.\nI'd like to spend a few minutes expanding on how we expect each of these components to contribute to greater free cash flow and improved working capital over the long term. Let's start with improved cash conversion at TransAct. About 8% of our revenue comes from TransAct, which has tripled in size since we acquired it in Q3 2019. However, the cash conversion dynamics of this business are different than the rest of our businesses. Q4 is TransAct's largest revenue quarter, and that revenue consists of both fees and commissions. The commissions, which reflect both our initial placement plus estimated future renewals can take up to 5 to 6 years in total for us to collect depending on the product. Meanwhile, we incur significant upfront cash costs to place the policies, creating a working capital headwind as the business grows.\nIn 2022, growth in TransAct created an approximately 200 basis point headwind on our free cash flow margin. Over the last few years of rapid growth in that business, we have generated a long-term contract asset, which is essentially a large long-term receivable. We expect to collect this over multiple years as policies are renewed. As our TransAct business continues to mature and cash collections from earlier periods outpaced the upfront cash outflows incurred in connection with the continued top line growth, we expect this working capital headwind to subside and over time become a tailwind and begin contributing positively to free cash flow margin.\nOur overall individual marketplace strategy combines TransAct with its strong revenue growth prospects and current lower cash flow generation with a mature business of Extend Health, which has lower revenue growth but strong cash flow. Together, the 2 businesses give us an overall Medicare operation with a strong growth profile and positive cash flow as was the case for 2022.\nMoving on to the impact of our Transformation Program. We made substantial progress on the program in 2022 and have accelerated that progress in 2023. Funding the Transformation Program required approximately $200 million in cash outflow in 2022, which translated to a roughly 230 basis point headwind to our free cash flow margin. Investment in the Transformation Program will continue to pressure our free cash flow until it is complete at the end of 2024. But beginning in 2025, the abatement of program-related spending will drive an increase in free cash flow margin.\nThe last point I'd like to cover is the upside from greater profitability. We continue to expect to drive margin expansion from current levels to our target range over the next 6 quarters. As our adjusted operating margin grows, so too will our free cash flow margin. In addition, we expect some of our specific transformation program initiatives to have a positive but more modest impact on free cash flow margin. Our finance and operational transformation initiatives include a number of tactical working capital improvement opportunities such as centralizing and standardizing our billing and collections processes, expanding automation capabilities, and capturing long-term structural and contractual improvements to the cash aspects of how our businesses operate. Also, the transformation of our real estate footprint should reduce our long-term CapEx needs.\nTogether, all of these actions, along with the continued adjusted operating margin expansion beyond 2024 should drive incremental improvements in our free cash flow margin above the roughly 400 basis points we've quantified.\nTurning to our results for the quarter. Our second quarter revenue was up 7% on an organic basis. Excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 9%. Our Transformation Program delivered $53 million of incremental annualized savings during the second quarter. This brings the total to $128 million in cumulative annualized savings this year, far exceeding our original target of $100 million of incremental savings for 2023. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings actioned by the end of 2023 to $160 million. The additional transformation savings we've identified also support an increase to the total annual cost savings we expect the program to deliver by the end of 2024 from over $360 million to $380 million.\nI will now discuss our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career segment generated revenue growth of 5% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of last year. The segment had solid organic revenue growth despite significant headwinds from book of business activity in the prior year, which negatively impacted organic revenue growth by 2 percentage points. We continue to see growth opportunities across the portfolio of businesses and expect that they will continue their growth trajectory for the rest of the year.\nRevenue for Health increased 4% for the quarter or 9% when excluding the impact of book of business activity in the prior year. Primarily due to natural portfolio growth and new client appointments in international and Europe and higher levels of project work at brokerage income in North America. Wealth grew 5% in the second quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of retirement work in North America and Europe. Our investments business also contributed to organic revenue growth with new client acquisitions and higher fees related to value-added services. Career delivered 4% growth in the quarter, driven by increased demand for reward-based advisory services and higher compensation survey participation. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 7% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by strength in individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and Life Policies as well as increased project activity in outsourcing.\nHWC's operating margin decreased 40 basis points from the prior year second quarter to 18.3%. This margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of book of business activity, partially offset by transformation savings. Risk & Broking revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year second quarter. Risk & Broking had strong organic revenue growth despite significant book of business headwinds and excluding the impact from book of business settlements, Risk & Broking grew 10%. Corporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter and continued the positive growth trajectory we have seen over the last quarters with an organic revenue increase of 7%. Excluding book of business activity, CRB grew at 11% with double-digit growth in all geographies. This outstanding result is primarily driven by strong new business, continued improvement of our client retention and strong contributions of 13% organic growth from our specialty lines like Marine Financial Solutions and Large and Complex P&C.\nOur specialty lines of business are a critical area for us, and we are making meaningful investments to position us for long-term success, and we are growing at a much faster pace in these lines of business. Furthermore, while rate increases continue to have a positive impact, they had a more moderate impact compared to prior year. Interest income was up $9 million for the quarter due to higher rates. As noted in our earnings release and as a result of the cessation of the co-broking agreement with Gallagher, interest income directly associated with Risk & Broking fiduciary funds will be allocated to the segment beginning in third quarter of 2023. These amounts were previously allocated to the corporate segment. I would just point out that this will be done on a prospective basis only, and there is no impact to the Q2 numbers.\nNorth America had a strong quarter due to new business and increased retention. Europe also had solid new business performance across most product lines, including P&C, Marine, Aerospace and Financial Solutions. International also contributed to organic growth led by Latin America. In the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 3% over the prior year period, driven by increased sales in Technology Solutions and higher project activity. R&D's operating margin was 16.1% for the second quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year second quarter. Margin headwinds reflected the impact of the gain on sale from book of business activity in the prior year, along with the adverse timing impact from prior year incentive credits that have no impact on full year margins, but negatively impacted the quarter.\nHowever, we saw an increase in our comp and bend run rate due to strategic investment hires. These key hires have begun to contribute to our performance in a meaningful way as exemplified by the strong organic growth for the first half of the year. We continue to expect a ramp-up in production which we anticipate will cover the increase in expenses. We are also facing expense headwinds due to the increased client activity and inflationary increases on travel, entertainment and marketing that we are actively managing with strict cost management actions which we expect to yield a greater benefit in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting these margin headwinds were transformation savings that continue to contribute as planned as well as the impact of interest income.\nTurning back to enterprise level results. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, a 90 basis point decline over prior year, primarily a result of costs related to employee headcount increases and inflation as well as headwinds from the margin impact of book of business sales in the prior year. The decline in margin was partially offset by transformation savings as well as the impact of interest income. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.05. Foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on EPS for the second quarter. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.8% versus 10.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.7% compared to 20.5% in the prior year reflecting the nonrecurring nature of discrete tax benefits reflected in the prior year rate.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities. During the quarter, we paid $90 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $350 million. Given our confidence in achieving the plan we've laid out, we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We also actively manage our leverage profile by issuing $750 million of new debt in May, and a portion of those proceeds will be used to pay our debt with an upcoming maturity in the third quarter.\nWe generated free cash flow of $350 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to free cash flow of $198 million in the prior year. The improvement of $152 million is primarily due to the nonrecurrence of payments made in the prior year for certain discretionary compensation and taxes for onetime gains recorded in connection with the Willis Resale and the income receipt related to deal termination. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nOverall, while we recognize we have more to do, we continue to be encouraged by the meaningful traction we are getting with clients through our strategic initiatives. Delivering strong organic revenue growth is a prerequisite for sustainably growing margins, EPS and free cash flow. We are confident in our market position and in our ability to deliver on the improvement opportunities we see today.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to the WTW First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to wtwco.com from the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning as well as other disclosures in the most recent Form 10-K and in other Willis Towers Watson SEC filings.\nDuring the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed. For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results were a great start for the year. The strong 8% organic revenue growth we delivered in the first quarter demonstrated our sustained momentum and intense focus as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities or [indiscernible] impact we're seeing from our recent investments in talented technology, which have strengthened the value we're able to provide our clients and yielded improved retention and new business growth.\nOperating leverage on this robust growth and the continued succession of our transformation program, drove 140 base operating margin expansion over the prior year, which translated into adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.84 for the quarter, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 results and with the excellent progress we've made since this time last year. We saw top line growth across all our businesses, reflecting the increased value of WTW solutions in complex economic environments. Amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation and ongoing geopolitical strife, we continue to see market dynamics that provide opportunities for WTW to respond to our clients' needs to improve outcomes and reduce risk.\nNow I'd like to share some additional perspective on the reset of our near and long-term expectations for free cash flow announced this morning. Our previous target for 3-year cumulative free cash flow through 2024 reflected our goal of substantially improving our free cash flow margin. This being in addition to achieving our revenue and margin targets.\nWe have made timely and meaningful progress toward our goals for revenue and adjusted operating margins, and we continue to believe that our long-term free cash flow improvement opportunities remain substantial and achievable. These opportunities include optimizing structural and contractual aspects of our business, enhancing our system and processes and streamlining our working capital.\nHowever, we now believe that the best and most sustainable path to realizing those opportunities will take us beyond the end of 2024. As a result, over the near term, we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue to improve significantly from 2022's base of 8% free cash flow margin. Over the longer term, we still anticipate growth towards peers free cash flow margins as the benefits from our improvement actions gain more traction and begin to drive a shorter conversion cycle.\nI want to make it very, very clear that we remain committed to delivering on our core operating results. Our achievements on those fronts so far, including our very solid start to 2023, give us confidence that we will be successful in delivering on those goals.\nBefore turning it over to Andrew, I also want to update you on our Growth, Simplify and Transform initiatives. Our growth initiatives take advantage of the opportunities in both core and fast-growing markets using our analytics capabilities and specialist knowledge to help create a more valuable and differentiated client experience. In Risk and Broking, our specialized approach, coupled with the strategic hires we've made over the past year have driven accelerated growth. In health, wealth and Korea, we've had success cross-selling new solutions and products alongside our core advisory work.\nOur focus on specialization has driven us to find improvements to existing solutions, new product innovation and most recently, identification and successful execution on opportunities for strategic collaboration. For example, we just announced a partnership with Zurich involving digital trading within our broking platform, which leverages data to structure risk to allow for a more competitive placement experience.\nAnother example of our strategic partnerships is our new relations with Sapiens, a leading global provider of software for the insurance industry. We have partnered with Sapiens to create integrated solutions to help insurers underwrite policies more efficiently. These are both great examples of how our innovations are driving growth by streamlining the very complex business of risk management and modernizing traditional broking while giving our customers a quicker and more efficient experience.\nA third example is our partnership with Transamerica to oversee administration and recordkeeping for our recently launched LifeSight pooled employer plan in the U.S. This new product will allow employers to offer a market-leading defined contribution plan and employee experience with limited demand on their internal resources.\nShifting to our Simplify initiatives, we believe our improved sales and retention outcomes have resulted in part from our efforts to streamline the back-end shared operations. This has enabled us to deploy a more cohesive and consistent global model that leverages our scale and provides a smoother client experience from prospect to renewal.\nFinally, our transformation program delivered $75 million of incremental annualized savings during the first quarter, consistent with the expected pacing of the $100 million in incremental run rate savings we expect to generate from the program this year. This brings the total to $224 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. We continue to search for additional opportunities for savings.\nOverall, we believe we're making progress toward our long-term organic growth, margin expansion and EPS targets. Continued execution of our strategic initiatives this quarter delivered healthy organic revenue growth strong adjusted operating margin expansion and further savings from our transformation program.\nIn closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter and even dedication. We are truly appreciative of their continued commitment to our vision and the relentless focus on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Karl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our clients continue to face a host of economic challenges, including rising commercial insurance rates. However, pricing increases appear to be moderating as our fourth quarter 2022 commercial lines insurance pricing survey showed an aggregate increase of just below 5%.\nData for nearly all lines continue to indicate price increases with the exception of workers' compensation and directors and officers liability. The largest price increases came in commercial auto, followed by commercial property. We continue to focus on helping our clients with our specialized knowledge and risk and broking capabilities so they can make more informed decisions about how to best manage their risk in the current environment.\nAs Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year with first quarter revenue up 8% on an organic basis and solid growth across our portfolio of businesses. Our adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, a 140 basis point improvement over prior year, reflecting our growth and expense discipline, along with the benefits of our transformation program. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.84, a 7% increase over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The health, wealth and career segment generated revenue growth of 6% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of last year.\nRevenue for health increased 8% for the quarter primarily due to increased project work in North America related to helping clients implement legislative changes and managed plan costs as well as from strong growth in international with new client appointments supplemented by health care inflation and increases in client covered populations.\nWell, grew 4% in the first quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of retirement work in Europe and North America, including compliance and derisking projects along with new client acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our Investments business, which continued to be pressured by the decline in capital markets that occurred in the second half of 2022.\nCareer experienced 4% growth in the quarter, driven by increased demand for advisory services and increases in data and software license sales. Benefits, delivery and outsourcing generated 7% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by new outsourcing clients and compliance projects plus strength in our individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies.\nHWC's operating margin was 24% this quarter compared to 20.7% in the same prior year period. This strong margin growth was primarily due to higher operating leverage. Risk and Broking revenue was up 10% on an organic basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year first quarter.\nCorporate Risk and Broking had an outstanding quarter with an organic revenue increase of 10% and driven by growth across all regions and most lines of business, primarily from new business and improved retention. As we've indicated, book of business settlement activity has slowed after the uptick over the last 2 years with only a 1 percentage point impact on organic growth for the quarter.\nInvestment income was $12 million for the quarter due to higher rates and impacted organic growth for the quarter by 1 percentage point. North America had a strong quarter due to new and renewal business and increased retention, a result of the strategic investments and initiatives that Carl highlighted earlier.\nEurope also had solid new business performance across a number of product lines including aerospace, financial solutions and natural resources as our focus on building and strengthening our industry and product specializations continues to deliver robust growth. International also contributed to organic growth with double-digit growth in all regions.\nIn the Insurance, Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 7% over the prior year period, primarily driven by increased sales and retention in Technology Solutions. R&B operating margin was 19.9% for the first quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year first quarter. Margin headwinds reflect the inclusion of profits up until the date of deconsolidation from our now divested Russia business in the comparable period.\nAbsent this headwind, margins improved as a result of organic revenue growth in CRB and transformation savings, gain on sale and interest income, partially offset by the run rate impact of 2022 strategic investment hires. As we expected, last year's key hires have begun to contribute to our performance in a meaningful way as exemplified by the solid organic growth this quarter, and we continue to expect a ramp-up in production this year.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. We generated profitable growth this quarter with our adjusted operating margin increasing 140 basis points to 18.6% from 17.2% in the prior year. This improvement reflects the benefits of higher operating leverage from the increased top line growth and transformation-related savings, which we expect to continue to be a key contributor to our ongoing margin expansion and the attainment of our 2024 margin goals.\nPlease note that the margin tailwind created by interest income and book of business settlement activity was offset by the margin headwind from the divestiture of our highly profitable Russia business, whose results were included in the prior year up until the date of deconsolidation.\nForeign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.06 for the first quarter, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.05. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% versus 27.5% in the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year. The current quarter adjusted tax rate is lower primarily due to the favorable impact of discrete items in the current year. The adjusted tax rate for the full year may increase moderately as a result of the U.K. corporate tax rate increase which became effective on April 1.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments in strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we paid $87 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 432,000 shares for $104 million. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital. We generated free cash flow of $92 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to free cash flow of negative $10 million in the prior year.\nThe $102 million year-over-year improvement in free cash flow was primarily driven by more favorable working capital improvements resulting mostly from higher cash collections and lower discretionary compensation payments made in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.\nOur Q1 results are reflective of the progress we've made since the beginning of 2022. We've come a long way stabilizing the business, rebuilding our talent base, strengthening our organic revenue growth and accelerating the transformation program to drive greater profitability in the future. We're committed to delivering the same success with free cash flow generation.\nThough our actual cash flow have not yet yielded results within the time frame we expected, we remain focused in the near term on driving meaningful improvement in our free cash flow margin for 2022's base of 8% free cash flow margin, and in the longer term, making continual progress and moving more towards peer levels.\nAs free cash flow generation remains a high priority, we've made enhancements to our original improvement plans to strengthen our organizational focus on cash flow. As you may have seen in our proxy statement, we have added free cash flow as a KPI for annual incentives in the executive compensation program and are working on implementing cash flow-linked KPIs for others in the organization to drive broader accountability across the company.\nIn addition, we are focused on pursuing long-term structural and contractual improvements to the cash aspects of how our businesses operate. As you might expect, this is the area where we have the largest class of opportunity to improve, but those opportunities are the most time consuming to realize.\nAs a reminder, full year 2023 pension income is expected to be about $112 million. If this level of pension income remains consistent in 2024, it would pose a significant headwind to our 2024 adjusted EPS target. Pension income, which is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions is remeasured at year-end. Accordingly, we will provide additional guidance on our 2024 pension income expectations and the resulting impact to the adjusted EPS target when we release Q4 2023 earnings results.\nOverall, we are excited by the strong start to 2023 with business performance ramping up as expected, and the benefits of our investments in talent and technology starting to meaningfully contribute to results. In addition, our successful transformation efforts and operating leverage have allowed us to continue to drive margin expansion. We have made consistent progress in our commitments for organic revenue growth and increased operating margins and EPS.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. In 2022, we focused on executing against our growth, simplify and transform strategic priorities, continuing to bring the best of WTW to our clients and generating value for our shareholders. I'm proud to say that we delivered on all of these commitments. Today, we are stronger, more resilient and better positioned than we were a year ago, and I'm excited about what we will achieve going forward.\nOur fourth quarter performance reflects the momentum we've been building and is a solid finish to a great year. In Q4, we delivered 5% organic growth which brought our full year organic growth to 4%, in line with the mid-single-digit forecast for 2022. We also saw a modest margin expansion, despite significant headwinds from prior year book of business settlement activity, which is expected to normalize going forward. We generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.33, up 12% over the prior year fourth quarter. We also continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy completing another $440 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $3.5 billion.\nOur transformation efforts continue to have a significant impact. During the fourth quarter, we realized $49 million of incremental annualized savings. This brings the total to $149 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception and positions us well to achieve our 2024 target of $360 million. In advancing our simplified goals, we further refined our organizational structure by consolidating our Asia and Australasia operations into one Asia Pacific region. This streamlined unit will be better able to leverage shared resources and to seamlessly serve clients in the region. Simon Weaver, who is previously the head of AustralAsia will lead the new integrated region and be responsible for driving growth through closer collaboration across the business.\nFor our grow initiatives, we remain focused on driving better outcomes for our clients through our innovative and differentiated offerings. Most recently, we launched a customized online platform for the aviation sector which gives our clients access to WTW's expertise across the globe, 24/7. Tailored to the unique challenges and needs of the sector, this platform allows airline and aviation-related clients to share technical expertise, news and insights, strengthening the breadth and depth of our client and industry relationships. We also advanced our grow initiatives with the recent introduction of WTW's collaboration with Liberty Specialty Markets and Markel. Together, we launched the pilot phase of an innotive digital commercial insurance platform. This is a significant step forward in our broader strategy to transform our digital capabilities across the entire value chain. The venture will improve connectivity, giving brokers efficient, flexible trading options.\nElsewhere within Risk and Broking, the ongoing rollout of our industry specialization strategy in CRB is producing great results with our global lines of business driving high single-digit organic growth. We're also excited by the traction our growing initiatives have gained within Health wealth and Career. Our focus on making connections across our businesses produced meaningful benefits in the fourth quarter with a noteworthy portion of our discretionary project sales referred by other businesses.\nIn 2022, we made significant investments in rebuilding our talent base. WTW hired over 9,700 colleagues last year, demonstrating the appeal of WTW as a destination for talent. Our investment has translated into revenue growth in 2022, and we expect this to continue throughout 2023. We also saw the benefit of our retention efforts with voluntary attrition remaining in line with macro trends. As a result, WTW finished the year with 46,600 colleagues around the globe, an increase that has restored our headcount to 2019 levels despite the divestitures made since that time.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter performance. The progress we have made to date, executing our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform gives us confidence that WTW is on the right path to drive sustainable growth and value creation.\nIn the year ahead, we're focused on further accelerating our growth, driving greater operating leverage and prioritizing cash generation. The current complex economic environment supports our ambitions. Our clients are facing many uncertainties, including inflation, rising interest rates, softer GDP growth, a tight labor market, ESG risk and potential recession. The regulatory focus on pensions in an uncertain economic environment is also heightened. As we've seen historically, such volatility can create strong demand for specialist work and products that our unique combination of businesses provide. I'm pleased with our ability to help clients evaluate their risks and opportunities in these complex environments.\nFor example, recent market dynamics have provided defined benefit plan sponsors for the increased funding levels, which in turn has created flexibility to explore a range of potential alternatives including modifications to investment strategies as well as pension risk transfer options. We've seen a significant increase in pension risk transfer projects, many of which evolved over multiple years and require a high degree of specialization. In addition, we're seeing increased interest in clients reviewing their nonqualified benefits as well as investigating programs to manage their workforces, additional areas in which we are ideally placed to help.\nMany of our clients also continue to navigate sustained rising commercial insurance rates. Across various lines, insurers are pushing for premium increases. This causes even greater challenges for our clients as they try to manage complex risks. We're well positioned to help clients through this difficult rate environment. Our customized tools ensure that clients get the best return for their premium dollar across their entire portfolio of risks. We call this Connected Risk Intelligence and believe it represents the future of financially efficient insurance buying. At the same time, we continue to build momentum.\nOur recent hires are becoming more productive. We're getting faster, more agile and better connected and our transformation program is delivering. We see continued demand from clients seeking our solutions to manage their unique challenges, which strengthens our conviction in achieving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2023. We expect to deliver another year of operating margin expansion led by an incremental $100 million in annualized transformation program cost savings and improved free cash flow. Andrew will share more details on our outlook for the year, but in short, we're driving hard to achieve our long-term targets.\nIn closing, our performance in 2022 demonstrated our focus on delivering on our commitments and our pursuit of profitable, sustainable growth. We believe that robust client demand in the face of a complex risk environment and the successful execution of our strategy will continue to drive momentum and we remain focused on achieving our goals and creating shareholder value.\nLast, but certainly not least, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this year. I sincerely appreciate their dedication, service and continued commitment to our clients. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we finished the year on a high note and our outlook for 2023 is positive. Now I'd like to share some further details on our financial results.\nThe fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, with revenue up 5% on an organic basis. For the year, organic revenue growth was 4%, and we had solid growth across our portfolio of businesses. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.33, an increase of 12% over the prior year. For the year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $13.41, representing 16% growth over the prior year.\nNow on to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The health, wealth and career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the year-over-year headwind from book of business settlement activity, HWC's organic revenue grew 6%.\nRevenue for health was flat for the fourth quarter primarily due to a strong comparative arising from book gains in the prior year. Excluding this activity, health revenue grew 6%, primarily driven by portfolio growth and new client appointments in Europe and international as well as increased project work in North America related to helping clients manage increasing costs and implementing legislative changes.\nWealth grew 5% in the fourth quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of project work actuarial valuation activity and new administration clients in North America and a combination of regulatory and settlement work in Great Britain. This growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our Investments business, which was pressured by declines in capital markets, an expected headwind we mentioned during our third quarter earnings call. The Wealth business finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, offsetting declines experienced earlier in 2022.\nCareer experienced 9% growth in the fourth quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for talent and compensation products, including compensation benchmarking surveys and advisory work, as well as employee engagement offerings, which we expect to continue this year. Benefits Delivery and Outsourcing generated 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace, with strong growth from higher volumes and placements in Medicare Advantage policies. As expected, TRANZACT delivered double-digit growth in its seasonally strongest quarter and for the full year. Driven by a supportive macro environment and our focus on profitably growing the business.\nTechnology and Administrative Solutions revenue also increased primarily due to new client appointments and increased project activity. We continue to see growth opportunities for these businesses and expect that they will continue their growth trajectory into 2023. HWC's operating margin was 39% for the third quarter compared to 38.2% in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of book of business activity, HWC's operating margin was 39% compared to 37.6% in the prior year fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, HWC's operating margin was 26.1% compared to 25.6% in the prior year. The 50 basis point improvement was due to improved operating leverage and transformation-related savings. Risk and Broking revenue was up 5% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the headwind from book of business settlement activity, R&D's organic revenue increased 6%. Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, organic revenue increased 3%. Excluding book of business settlement activity, CRB's organic revenue growth was 5%. The business generated growth across all regions, driven by new business wins in construction, natural resources and aerospace. Excluding headwinds from prior year book of business settlements, North America revenue increased with notable growth in construction. Europe and international also made strong contributions to CRB's growth with new business in construction and aerospace.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 17% over the prior year fourth quarter, benefiting from the timing of software sales, which had originally been expected earlier in the year as well as increased advisory work. For the year, ICT delivered strong growth of 9%, in line with our long-term expectations for this business. R&D's operating margin was 28.3% for the quarter compared to 30.1% in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of book of business activity, RMB's operating margin was 27.6% for the quarter compared to 28.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, RMB's operating margin was 21.2% compared to 23.4% in the prior year. The decline in margin was due to our significant investments in talent. We expect these investments to continue to gain momentum in 2023 as the contributions of these hires become more meaningful.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. Adjusted operating income was $882 million for the quarter with 32% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year. For the year, adjusted operating margin was 20.9%, a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our improved adjusted operating margins primarily reflect the benefits of strategic portfolio management which were realized at the corporate level, alongside transformation program savings, which were realized at the segment level, but in some of our businesses were more than offset by our increased investments in talent during the period.\nAs Carl mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we realized $49 million of incremental annualized savings. Transformation savings will continue to be a key aspect of our ongoing margin expansion efforts as we're encouraged by the results this year, which exceeded both our original $30 million target for 2022 and our most recent forecast of $110 million for the year. To date, our transformation savings have outpaced our original expectations from a timing perspective, driven primarily by accelerated workforce savings, technology savings from migrating operations to the cloud and reductions in our overall real estate footprint.\nFor 2023, we expect our transformation program to deliver approximately $100 million in incremental run rate savings by the end of the year with continued contributions from real estate, technology and process optimization. Foreign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.25 for the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect foreign currency to be a $0.06 headwind in Q1 of 2023, but only a $0.01 headwind for the full year. We generated free cash flow of $674 million for 2022 compared to free cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of the $1 billion termination fee in the comparable period and the absence of cash generation from the divested treaty reinsurance business.\nLooking ahead, growing earnings and generating healthy free cash flow remain our priorities. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.7% versus 20.8% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% versus 21.1% in the prior year, with the difference primarily due to the geographic distribution of profits. For the year, our U.S. GAAP tax rate was 15.4% versus 19.9% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the full year was 20.9%, more in line with the 20.7% rate in the prior year.\nIn 2022, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, paying $369 million in dividends and repurchasing 15.7 million shares for $3.5 billion. We will continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities. While we expect share repurchases to remain the primary avenue for capital deployment, we continue to evaluate all our options to create value for shareholders.\nTurning to our 2023 guidance. Based on current market conditions, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth alongside adjusted operating margin expansion despite continued investments in long-term growth. We also expect an improvement in free cash flow now that onetime cash outflows primarily related to our divested treaty reinsurance business are behind us. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see $100 million in incremental annualized transformation program savings. With respect to noncash pension income, we expect to see a decline due to market volatility and interest rate movements.\nFor 2023, we expect about $112 million in pension income as compared to $271 million in 2022. I'd like to note that despite this dynamic, the funded position of our plans has improved. We remain focused on our long-term targets and recognize that to achieve them, we will need to build on prior momentum and continue to accelerate revenue, margin and cash flow growth. Each of these areas remains the subject of significant management attention.\nOverall, it was a strong quarter and year for WTW with performance that aligned with our expectations. Our results reflect a lot of hard work, which included vigorous hiring efforts, investments in technology, successful transformation initiatives and the unwavering dedication of our colleagues. We ended the year in a solid position, and I'm confident that we will continue to build momentum in 2023 as we work to achieve our long-term targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please refer to wtwco.com for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW's website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law.

Please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI will now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining for WTW's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter performance reflects the increasing momentum we see in the business and our intense focus on delivering on our commitments. As projected, our organic revenue growth accelerated reaching 6% this quarter fueled by the great efforts of our colleagues and the strength of our global client model and further augmented by the investments we've made in talent and technology.\nWe generated adjusted diluted earnings of $2.20 per share and drove 110 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, thanks to our transformation program, continued expense discipline and operating leverage from new business. We also continue to execute against our capital allocation strategy, completing $369 million in share repurchases in the third quarter. That brings our year-to-date total to $3.1 billion.\nWe're pleased with our third quarter performance and our progress executing our strategy to grow, simplify and transform gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our guidance for 2022 and to drive growth and value creation over the long term.\nA year ago, at our Investor Day, we laid out our strategy for how we take WTW forward and deliver robust shareholder returns. Before getting into the details of the quarter, I want to provide you with an update on these initiatives. While it's still early in our journey, and there is more work to do, we have made substantial progress and are seeing encouraging signs that our investments and actions will yield the long-term improvement we expect. Our transformation efforts have made the most immediate impact. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our focus on continuous improvement has helped us identify new opportunities and incremental sources of value as well as areas in which we can accelerate progress.\nDuring the third quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental annualized savings. This brings the total to $100 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception, far exceeding our original $30 million target for 2022. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings action by the end of 2022 from over $80 million to approximately $110 million. The additional transformation savings we've identified also supported increase to the total annual cost savings we expect the program to deliver by the end of 2024 from $300 million to $360 million. And as I said, there's still more work to do, and we will continue searching for additional opportunities.\nMeanwhile, our Simplify and Grow initiatives are powering the increasing momentum we see in the business. One of our key simplify activities has been streamlining shared operations to improve sales and retention outcomes. Our accelerated growth and robust pipeline demonstrate the progress we've made deploying this more agile model globally.\nFor our Grow initiatives, we remain focused on investment in both core and fast-growing markets and innovation to drive differentiation and better client outcomes. In Corporate Risk and Broking, our investments in specialized solutions and strategic hires for our global lines of business are meaningfully accelerating growth with most lines growing double digits this quarter.\nIn Health, Wealth and Career we've seen strong uptake of our solutions that are cross sold across the segment and are increasingly bundling products into our core advisory work.\nOur focus on innovation is driving improvements to existing solutions as well as launches of new products. For example, WTW's global payroll diagnostic tool is a sophisticated model, which provides refined evaluation of comprehensive catastrophe risks. The model clarifies exposure to terrorism in 12 natural perils and includes live event tracking for events such as pandemics, earthquakes, wind storms. We've recently enhanced this tool with hurricane tracking advisory and resiliency scoring, upgrading the sophisticated foundational tool with next-level analytics.\nAnalytics is a key area for new product development as well, including the recent launch of Risk Intelligence Quantified or Risk IQ. This flexible and crystallized platform provides risk specialists with autonomous access to the breadth of WTW's leading Risk & Analytics solutions. Risk IQ puts managers in control of their analytic outputs, providing patients with the ability to run business-critical scenarios and prepare for potential losses.\nWTW is at the forefront when it comes to delivering valuable strategic solutions across this market and Risk IQ further highlights our client-centric capabilities. Our new products reflect the evolution of our services to align with the changing needs of our clients.\nIn addition, our ongoing investments to rebuild our talent base are proceeding as expected. The pace of hiring in the third quarter matched that of the first half of the year. We also continue to see the benefit of retention efforts with voluntary attrition remaining in line with macro trends.\nOne Grow initiative from Investor Day that has not been a focus for us to date is inorganic expansion. While we expect share repurchases to remain the primary avenue for capital deployment, we are still committed to identifying attractive opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and add scale and fill gaps in our capabilities via acquisitions as part of our broader capital allocation strategy, particularly with the market now tilting in favor of buyers.\nOver the past year, we've developed a strong understanding of where we could benefit from deploying capital, which enables us to be a disciplined and opportunistic buyer. The progress we have made to date gives us confidence that WTW is on the right path but we also recognize that we have more work to do. We'll share a more detailed outlook for 2023 next quarter, and we continue to believe we will deliver on our long-term organic growth and margin expansion expectations.\nWhile we're on this topic, I wanted to take some time to discuss our decision to reflect the impact of the Russian divestiture in our 2024 guidance. As you know, during the first quarter of 2022, we announced our intention to transfer ownership of our Russian subsidiaries to local management and work to identify potential longer-term offsets to the impact of the exit. The transfer was completed in the third quarter, and given the current conditions, we do not anticipate resuming operations there in the foreseeable future. WTW's operations in Russia, which were almost entirely within our Risk and Broking segment, comprised approximately 1% of consolidated revenue for 2021 and were highly profitable. Due to the unusual circumstances under which the divestiture was made, there were essentially no proceeds from the transfer. As a result of this one-off event, we are unable to replace the lost earnings through reinvestment of proceeds.\nWith the transaction complete, we believe it's now appropriate to revise the starting and ending points of our long-term guidance to reflect the divestiture of WTW's Russian operations, just as we would any other significant transaction. I want to make it very clear that despite revising our long-term targets, we remain committed to delivering the same level of improvement, mid-single-digit, organic revenue growth and 400 to 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion as we set out at Investor Day.\nPage 4 of the earnings release published earlier this morning provides further disclosure on the divestiture and the related adjustments to our long-term guidance. Please note that our initial and revised targets exclude the potential effects of fluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nThe ongoing situation in Russia is a stark reminder of the heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic risk all basis is face today. I want to take a moment to talk about how we're helping our clients navigate this complicated and uncertain landscape. Our solutions help clients manage their human, physical and financial capital to protect and strengthen their institutions, and these tools only become more valuable in challenging times.\nInflation is top of mind. Our clients are increasingly seeking our advice and solutions to manage the impact of inflation on wages, health care costs, pensions and retirement plans. With tight labor markets persisting, solving these challenges is a strategic opportunity for clients, and we're helping them optimize total rewards spend, manage the cost of retirement and medical programs and efficiently fund and finance programs via pooling, global underwriting, captive strategies and delegated asset management.\nAnother hallmark of the current environment is how quickly it's changing. In addition to working with our clients to manage traditional ever-present risks, we're seeing strong demand from clients for innovative solutions and tools to help them identify, quantify and manage fast-moving risks such as more volatile financial markets, climate change, geopolitical tensions, heightened ESG risk and reputational damage to name a few. We're rising to this challenge by bringing the best of our organization together globally, creating market-leading analytical tools to help clients make better informed decisions and crafting customized solutions to meet our clients' emergent risks.\nOur performance in the quarter demonstrated our focus on delivering on our commitments and our pursuit of profitable sustainable growth. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy and robust client demand in the face of a very complex risk environment will keep us on track to achieve our guidance for 2022. We continue to build momentum and remain focused on the (inaudible) goals to create shareholder value.\nIn closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter. We are truly appreciative of their dedication, service and continued commitment to our vision. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, our clients are grappling with a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. Unfortunately, they have also continued to grapple with rising commercial insurance rates. While price increases appear to be moderating, WTW's Q2 commercial lines insurance pricing survey showed an aggregate increase of just below 6%. Data for nearly all lines continue to indicate significant price increases with the exception of works compensation and D&O liability. The largest price increase came from cyber followed by professional liability.\nIn light of these additional pressure points, we continue to focus on helping clients evaluate their options so they can make better informed decisions about how to best manage their risk portfolios.\nTurning to our financial results. The third quarter was in line with our expectations. On an organic basis, revenue was up 6%, reflecting accelerating growth across all of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $284 million or 14.5% of revenue for the quarter, up 110 basis points from $264 million or 13.4% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.20, representing 27% growth over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 4% are both in organic and constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business delivered growth of 6%, primarily driven by increased demand for products and advisory work in North America spurred by clients focus on mitigating likely 2023 cost increases and by U.S. legislative changes. Revenue also grew outside of North America as a result of new client appointments and increases in health care premiums.\nWealth, which consists of our retirement and investment businesses grew 3% in the quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of regulatory and project work in Europe as well as increased consulting work in North America. The growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our delegated investment solutions business, which was pressured by declines in capital markets. While we expect the headwind from these declines to persist into the fourth quarter, we see momentum in building in the rest of the Wealth business during the remainder of the year, driven by new client acquisition and strong demand for specialist work in response to market volatility and legislative changes.\nCareer, which includes our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses also contributed to revenue growth for the segment, increasing 6% in the quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for talent and compensation products, including compensation benchmarking surveys, hiring assessments and employee engagement offerings, which we see continuing.\nBenefits Delivery and Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery and Administration and our Technology and Administrative Solutions businesses generated 2% revenue growth over the third quarter of 2021. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. Outsourcing revenue also increased due to new client appointments and growth across the existing client base. We continue to see an environment that supports growth opportunities for this business for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nHWC's operating margin was 20.3% this quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior period. The margin declined primarily to investments in resourcing and technology to support future revenue growth.\nAs economic uncertainty looms and market volatility persists, companies are dealing with high inflation rates, workplace stress caused by labor shortages as well as cost and risk management concerns related to pensions and health benefits. Against this challenging backdrop, HWC is helping companies better address employees' needs while managing business realities. Our near and long-term outlook for HWC remains positive as we expect its market-leading solutions and the ongoing demand drivers in its core businesses to continue to support organic growth.\nRisk and Broking revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year third quarter. Corporate Risk and Broking or CRB, revenue increased 6%. The business generated growth across all regions, primarily from new business with double-digit growth across most of our global lines of business. Book of business settlement activity was due to senior colleague departures in 2021 and is consistent with the levels seen in the prior year period. Thus, it did not affect CRB's year-over-year organic growth rate.\nBoth Europe and International led CRB's growth with improved client retention and notably strong new business in natural resources, construction and aerospace. Solid growth in North America was driven by strong contributions from both construction and M&A solutions.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 2% on top of a tough comparable of 18% growth in the prior year third quarter, primarily driven by increased Technology Solutions sales. On a year-to-date basis, ICT has delivered strong growth. It's trajectory continues to point towards a strong finish in the fourth quarter.\nR&B's operating margin was 13.7% for the third quarter compared to 17.5% in the prior year third quarter. Margin headwinds were driven by our significant investments in new revenue-producing and client service talent. Throughout this year, R&B welcomed new leaders and senior contributors across all geographies at both the regional and country level. Leveraging their industry expertise, these key hires have begun to contribute to our performance and we expect these contributions will become more meaningful going forward. The steady improvement in our talent base and client pipeline has strengthened our conviction that the work we have done to rebuild our talent base is gaining traction and will yield strong results.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q3, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margin increasing 110 basis points to 14.5% from 13.4% in the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefits of strategic portfolio management which was realized at the corporate level, alongside transformation program savings, which were realized at the segment level, but were more than offset by our increased investment in talent during the period.\nWe continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver on our 2024 margin goal. As Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to this ongoing margin expansion, and we're encouraged by the success of our early efforts. By accelerating shared services and our workforce centralization efforts, in addition to identifying incremental opportunities to drive collaboration through real estate portfolio optimization, we have far surpassed our original $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for the year. As a result, we raised both our near and long-term targets and now expect to deliver approximately $110 million in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2022 and $360 million by the end of 2024.\nForeign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.20 through the first 9 months of the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we've updated our guidance related to our expected foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share from a range of $0.20 to $0.25 to a range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30. We generated free cash flow of $337 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of the $1 billion termination fee in the comparable period, the absence of cash generation from the now divested Willis Re business and additional tax payments made this year on both the Willis Re, gain on sale and the termination fee.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 0.7% versus 22.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 16.8% versus 23.2% in the prior year. The current year adjusted tax rate is lower primarily due to lower U.S. fee expense and excess tax benefit on share-based compensation. We expect the full year 2022 adjusted tax rate to be relatively consistent with our historical rates.\nWe continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital on the highest return opportunities. During the third quarter of 2022, we paid $91 million in dividends and repurchased 1.8 million shares for $369 million.\nWe are pleased by our progress with business performance ramping as we expected. For the remainder of the year, we see macroeconomic environment that is creating demand for our services and opportunities to help clients with our unique combination of solutions. We feel positive about the investments we have made in talent, innovation and operational transformation and are confident these investments will continue to drive organic revenue growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, WTW delivered results that as expected, built off the solid start we had to our year. We generated organic revenue growth of 3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.32 as we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. Our transformation program, continued expense discipline and operating leverage from new business generation drove 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin despite headwinds from our growth investments.\nWe also continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and completed $471 million in share repurchases in the second quarter, bringing total share repurchases for 2022 to $2.7 billion. Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter performance and remain confident in our ability to deliver against our financial goals in both 2022 and the longer term. This confidence comes from our ongoing execution against our strategy to grow, simplify and transform as well as our continued progress in rebuilding our talent and ramping our productivity. Through the first half of the year, we've already seen top line benefits from our investments in talent, and we expect that benefit to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year.\nI'm particularly pleased with the results of our transformation initiatives. We realized $35 million of incremental annualized savings during the second quarter, bringing the total to $71 million cumulative since the program's inception will more than double our original $30 million target for 2022. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings identified by the end of 2022 from $30 million to over $80 million.\nIt's important to note that this increase is not simply pulling forward savings previously included in our $300 million medium-term target. Our focus on continuous improvement has helped us identify both areas in which we could accelerate progress as well as new opportunities and incremental sources of value.\nAs a result, we now expect the program to generate annual cost savings in excess of $300 million by the end of 2024.\nIn the second quarter, we also made progress on our grow initiatives, bringing to bear the full capabilities of 1 WTW for our clients through both new and existing solutions. Our strategic focus on scaling our global lines of business and Corporate Risk & Broking is gaining traction in the market with growth in these lines exceeding the CRB average by 50%. We also maintained a steady pace of new product launches, focusing on high-growth, high-need markets such as ESG analytics and climate risk. In April, we launched our ESG analytics program at the U.S. RIMS Conference. It's already generating early results by simplifying our client outreach and solving ESG data analytics and reporting needs for clients and has been part of 7-figure wins in 2 pilot markets in 2022.\nWe believe this solution has the potential to scale further in multiple markets around the world and we're building a world-class suite of climate risk management tools and solutions under our climate quantified banner. Following our development of the climate transition pathways of accreditation framework and the launch of our climate transition index with stocks in 2021.\nThis year, we introduced our climate transition value at risk data and software for asset managers and asset owners. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of 1 of our longtime climate analytics and software partners, further enhancing our technical capabilities. Our investments in this area are positioning us to be a global leader in helping organizations and manage climate transition risk. While new products are important, our approach to everyday innovation is also supporting our growth priority as we nimbly respond to legislative and other environmental changes.\nAs suggested by the everyday label, there's lots happening in this area. So I'll share just 1 to give you an idea. In response to the U.S. health care, No Surprises Act, we quickly developed and introduced transparency bundles, a cost-effective communication solution that supports clients in meeting their compliance obligations and is easily sold as an add-on to our existing clients.\nLastly, together with our strategic growth initiatives, our intense focus on onboarding talent has built a strong foundation for revenue growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The pace of hiring in the second quarter matched that of the first quarter, and our new hires in sales and client management roles doubled compared to the second quarter last year. We also continued to see the benefit of retention efforts with voluntary attrition at reasonable levels and aligned with macro trends.\nIn sum, we've been hard at work this quarter, changing the way we operate in creating a leaner, more innovative and more agile WTW. I'm confident that as these initiatives mature, they will improve our long-term financial performance as we expect them to deliver significant shareholder returns. Before I hand it over to Andrew to discuss our financial results, I want to take a moment to talk about the resilience of our business in the face of dynamic and challenging economic conditions.\nWe believe WTW is well positioned to weather macroeconomic uncertainty, including both inflation and potential recession. Our portfolio of businesses is relatively noncyclical, we estimate that about 80% of our revenue base is recurring, often built upon nondiscretionary solutions and services. In addition, our clients span a variety of industries and geographies and our solutions tend to increase importance and value in complex economic environments. For these reasons, our business is less sensitive to economic downturns than companies in some other industries. As an example, in 2020, when U.S. GDP declined by 2%, we still posted organic revenue growth of 2%.\nSimilarly, if you looked at our predecessor company's results from the 2008, 2009 economic downturn, you'd see that they continue to grow organic revenues by 2% to 4%. That said, we do have some exposure in economically sensitive lines of business, where the work we do is discretionary in nature, primarily in our Health, Wealth and Career segment, but we would expect the impact of that exposure and recession to be relatively low. Overall, our performance in the quarter was aligned with our expectations and reflected our commitment to profitable growth and the successful execution of our strategy. We continue to build momentum and remain focused on delivering on our long-term goals.\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to my incredible team of colleagues who live our values and have delivered every day for our clients in a volatile and challenging environment. With our sharpened focus, we are well positioned to continue driving growth and executing on our transformation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for more detail on our results.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before turning to our results, let me take a minute to expand on Carl's comments about WTW's ability to navigate difficult economic conditions. With interest rate spiking and equities exceptionally volatile in the second quarter, we believe the market is clearly signaling concerns about the near-term future of the economy and corporate profits. As Carl mentioned, during the previous economic downturns, WTW continued to thrive and grow revenues. We have also repeatedly demonstrated our resilient cost structure, which has allowed the business to maintain its earnings power during challenging economic times. Despite inflationary pressure on labor costs and the post-pandemic normalizing of variable costs such as travel, we remain steadfast in exercising financial discipline, and our outlook on near-term and long-term margin expansion remains unchanged.\nTurning to our financial results. The second quarter was aligned with our expectations. On an organic basis, revenue was up 3%, reflecting growth across most of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $314 million or 15.5% of revenue for the quarter up 30 basis points from $318 million or 15.2% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.32, representing 9% growth over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 2% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business, delivered growth of 8%. This includes a gain recorded in connection with book of business settlements related to senior staff departures that occurred in 2021. Excluding the book of business gain, Health's organic growth was 3%, primarily driven by new client appointments and further bolstered by project work.\nWealth, which consists of our retirement and investment businesses had a revenue decrease of 7% for the quarter. The decline was primarily due to a headwind from outsized performance fees that were recorded in the prior year quarter in our Investments business, as we've discussed previously. We expect to see significant improvement in the wealth businesses during the second half of the year driven by new client acquisition and strong market demand for specialist work in response to market volatility and legislative change.\nCareer, which includes our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses also contributed to the revenue growth for the segment increasing 5% in the quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for advisory work, data products and software licenses.\nIn Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery & Administration and our Technology and Administrative Solutions businesses, revenue increased 7% from the prior year second quarter. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. Outsourcing revenue also grew with new client appointments and growth across the existing client base. We continue to see a macro environment that supports growth opportunities for this business in 2022.\nHWC's operating margin was 18.7% this quarter compared to 18.6% in the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and onetime fees from book of business gains and performance fees, the margin expanded 80 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage and in-year savings from our transformation program.\nOur near-term and long-term outlook for HWC remain positive as we expect its market-leading solutions and the ongoing demand drivers in its core businesses to continue to drive organic growth.\nLooking at Risk and Broking, revenue was up 3% on an organic basis and 1% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. Excluding a modest headwind from book of business settlement activities, R&B's organic revenue increased 4%. Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, revenue increased 3%. Book of business settlement activity, which stemmed from senior colleague departures that occurred in 2021 declined nominally from the prior year but did not meaningfully affect CRB's year-over-year organic growth rate. The business generated growth across all regions, primarily from new business with notable strength in our M&A, Aerospace, Natural Resources and FINEX specialty lines. International led CRB's growth driven by growth in Natural Resources and Construction lines. Growth in North America and Europe came from both new business and improved client retention driven by the expansion of our teams in those regions and colleague retention rates at senior levels have continued to show improvement.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 9% compared to the prior year second quarter, driven by increased technology solutions sales and higher demand for advisory work. R&B's operating margin was 19.7% for the second quarter compared to 23.1% in the prior year second quarter. The margin decline was driven by our significant investment in new revenue-producing and client service talent. In Q2, R&B welcomed new leaders across all geographies. These key hires will deliver their industry expertise and specialty insights to clients across the globe in lines such as Construction, Aerospace, FINEX, Natural Resources and Facultative. Seeing steady improvements in our client pipeline has strengthened our conviction that the work we have done to rebuild our talent base will yield strong results throughout the second half of the year. We believe these actions will enable us to significantly accelerate organic growth and meet our longer-term goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth for this business.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q2, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margins increasing 30 basis points to 15.5% from 15.2% in the prior year primarily reflecting improved operating leverage and our transformation initiatives, which more than offset our increased investments in talent during the period. We continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver in our 2024 margin goals.\nAs Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to this ongoing margin expansion. Our early efforts in this area have been very successful. By accelerating shared services and workforce centralization efforts and identifying incremental opportunities to drive collaboration through real estate portfolio optimization we have far surpassed our $30 million annualized run-rate savings goal for the year. As a result, we raised both our near- and long-term targets.\nForeign currency with a headwind on adjusted EPS and of $0.17 through the first half of the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we've updated our guidance related to our expected foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share from a range of $0.15 to $0.20 to a range of approximately $0.20 to $0.25.\nWe generated free cash flow of $198 million for the first 6 months of 2022, an $89 million decrease from free cash flow of $287 million in the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to the absence of cash generation from the now divested Willis Re business as well as additional tax payments resulting from both the Willis Re sale and the deal termination fee received last year.\nWe continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders and executed aggressively on this commitment. During the second quarter of 2022, we paid $91 million in dividends and repurchased 2.1 million shares for $471 million. Of that $471 million, $253 million was completed during May and June. We also raised our repurchase authorization by $1 billion to $6.5 billion, of which approximately $2.1 billion remains. We continue to be committed to deploying excess capital and free cash flow into our highest return opportunities and still believe that the return we can achieve from repurchasing shares remains highly attractive. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy free cash flow in this manner, subject to market conditions.\nOverall, we're off to a good start in 2022 with the performance of the business ramping as we expected it would. As we think about the rest of the year, we see macroeconomic challenges that will create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We continue to feel positive about the investments we have made in talent, innovation and operational transformation and are confident those investments will drive organic revenue growth and margin expansion we have forecast for the year and position us to achieve our 2024 goals.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to the WTW First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to wtwco.com for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW's website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 (sic) [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995]. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.

For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding the measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI would now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThe first quarter marked a solid start to our year, with results that were in line with our expectations and reflect improved momentum in our business. We generated organic revenue growth of 2% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points, driven by new business generation and continued expense discipline.\nWe also continue to focus on executing our capital allocation strategy and have now completed $4.1 billion in share repurchases since our 2021 Investor Day. Overall, we've had a solid start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals for both 2022 and the longer term.\nBefore discussing our strategic progress and operating results, I'd like to share our heartbreak and dismay over the crisis in Ukraine. We wholeheartedly wish for a peaceful solution and remain steadfast in our support for all our colleagues and their families in the region who have been affected. Their safety and well-being have been top of mind in the past months.\nWTW has been in daily contact with any colleagues who've chosen to remain in the Ukraine and provided financial and accommodation support to those who chose to relocate. Our own special contingency risks operation is providing guidance and assistance to our Ukraine country leader. We're also encouraging our colleagues to utilize our matching gifts program to help increase financial donations for disaster relief. I'm proud of how our colleagues who come together in support. Thank you for showing up for each other.\nIn addition to supporting our employees, WTW is supporting clients in key areas related to this crisis, including claims and risk across various lines such as political, investment, supply chain and cyber.\nAs previously announced, WTW decided to withdraw from our business in Russia and transfer ownership to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. In a few minutes, Andrew will talk more about the financial impact of our decision to exit Russia.\nNow I'd like to provide a few updates on our progress against our company-wide priorities. At our last Investor Day, we unveiled our grow, simplify and transform strategy, and we executed against each of these strategic priorities during the first quarter. Innovation has always been a key area of focus for us. And as One WTW, we strive to bring the diverse capabilities of the enterprise together to innovate on behalf of our clients to address current and unmet needs, and we continue to do so in the first quarter.\nLet me walk you through just a few examples. Our Risk and Broking segment launched ESG analytics and diagnostics, which provides a multisource comprehensive analysis of a firm's ESG performance. We also introduced a bespoke reputational risk solution designed to help our clients understand, manage and recover from reputational crises. Both products address ESG risk, which is an area of rapidly growing importance for our clients. Our ongoing product innovation continues to drive growth in our Risk & Analytics business within Risk and Broking.\nIn Health, Wealth and Career, we unveiled a new employee insights platform called Engage to help clients understand their employees' views on various topics that affect the employee experience and, ultimately, business performance. We've had fantastic client feedback on Engage to date and are excited about its potential.\nI'm pleased to say that our commitment to innovation continues to be recognized by the industry. During the quarter, WTW secured the top spot in Advisen's Pacesetter Index and annual recognition of product innovation leadership in the P&C insurance industry. WTW topped the index having launched 16 new products and services in 2021. I'm proud of our team for earning this recognition, which reinforces our capabilities and our dedication to delivering innovative and actionable solutions for today's complex challenges in people, risk and capital.\nAt our Investor Day, I also spoke to you about our actions to simplify the business and make it easier and quicker to engage with our clients as we work to bring the best of WTW to them. We've advanced on this front as well, refocusing the company into 2 operating segments across 3 geographies to create a more streamlined structure and enhance the agility of the team while also enabling us to leverage common technology, platforms and processes.\nWe also shared our focus on transforming WTW to enhance speed to market and promote efficiency, and I'm encouraged by the progress we've made on our transformation initiatives. We realized $16 million of incremental annualized savings during the first quarter, bringing the total to $36 million since the program's inception. This exceeds our original $30 million target for all of 2022. And as part of this program, we introduced WTW work styles, a program which modernizes the way we work to align our real estate footprint to a hybrid working environment and contributes to our transformation program savings. WTW work styles reflects our belief that colleagues can be successful working in a variety of our ways and our confidence that a high-performing culture is the result of exceptional talent, not real estate.\nSpeaking of talent, our rate of hiring in the first quarter accelerated by 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, reaching our highest hiring volume in a single quarter since 2019. Our new hires in sales and client management roles tripled compared to the first quarter last year. We also continue to see retention efforts gain more traction in Q1, with voluntary attrition dropping 19% from Q4 of 2021 and a significant decline in senior level departures. We've seen the same positive dynamics play out in our Corporate Risk & Broking segment.\nLet me take a minute now to touch on some of our financial highlights for the quarter. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across most of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $371 million or 17.2% of revenue for the quarter, up 200 basis points from $338 million or 15.2% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability in the period. Net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.66, representing 22% growth over the prior year, in part due to our aggressive share repurchase program.\nOverall, our performance in the quarter was aligned with our expectations and reflected our commitment to profitable growth and the successful execution of our strategy. We continue to build momentum, and we believe our progress has us on track to reach our financial goals for 2022 and to become a $10 billion plus company by 2024.\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to my incredible team of colleagues who live our values and have delivered every day for our clients in a volatile and challenging environment. With our sharpened focus, we are well positioned to continue driving growth and executing on our transformation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for more detail on our results.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us so early in the day.\nThe first quarter saw dramatic macroeconomic and geopolitical changes that required us to navigate rapid and significant shifts in our markets that we expect will continue to evolve throughout the year. High inflation, uncertainty around how long it will last and tight labor supply are impacting our clients' people strategies in a variety of ways. Geopolitical and economic factors are affecting the insurance landscape, with events in Ukraine likely to dampen the short-term moderation in pricing growth. Monetary policy and inflationary forces are expected to translate into remeasured asset values and exposures, ultimately translating into premium growth. We continue to navigate through this complex and dynamic backdrop and have delivered a good start to the year, with most of our businesses contributing to organic revenue growth.\nBefore we turn to our detailed segment results, let me take a moment to touch on our exit from our Russian businesses. As we previously reported, we made the decision to exit our operations in Russia, which comprised approximately 1% of consolidated WTW revenue for 2021, primarily within our Risk and Broking segment. The lost profits from our Russia operations will create modest margin headwinds for the company in 2022 and beyond. However, we have taken swift action to deploy near-term cost mitigation measures and to identify longer-term offsets, which gives us confidence in achieving our guidance for the year and reaching our 2024 financial goals.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide clear comparability with all periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise.\nThe Health, Wealth and Career, or HWC segment, generated revenue growth of 2% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Career, which represents our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses, led revenue growth for the segment, increasing 7% in the quarter, following growth of 3% in Q4 of 2021. This growth was driven by strong demand for rewards consulting, pay benchmarking and software. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business, delivered strong growth of 6% through a combination of increased retention, new client appointments and project work. Wealth, which represents our Retirement and Investment businesses, had a revenue increase of 1% for the quarter, driven by growth from new clients.\nIn Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery & Administration and benefit plan administration businesses, revenue declined by 2% from the prior year first quarter. The decline was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected a shift in revenue timing from our B2B Medicare exchange business, which we expect to normalize over the course of 2022, as well as lower growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to see a macro environment that supports growth opportunities for this business.\nHWC's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 20.7% in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong operating leverage from our growth. We see HWC's historical industry-leading margins continuing. HWC's market-leading solutions and the tailwinds in its core markets should continue to drive organic growth. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on HWC remain positive.\nNow let's look at Risk and Broking, or R&B. R&B's revenue was flat on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Excluding a headwind from a book of business gain on sale that was recorded in the prior comparable period, Risk and Broking's organic revenue growth was 2%.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology, or ICT business, revenue was up 9% compared to the prior year first quarter, with increased technology solutions sales alongside increased demand for advisory work. Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, revenue declined 1%. Excluding the book of business sale I mentioned earlier and Russia-related revenue, CRB increased 3% and, growth across all regions, primarily from new business with notable strength in our FINEX and M&A lines. Excluding headwinds from prior year book of business sales, North America led CRB's growth, where colleague retention rates at senior levels have continued to show significant improvement. Excluding our Russia business, international and Europe also contributed to CRB's growth.\nRisk and Broking's operating margin was 21.6% for the first quarter compared to 21.9% in the prior year first quarter. Excluding the headwind from book of business sale in the prior period, the margin increased 130 basis points for the first quarter as a result of top line growth alongside continued cost management. Risk and Broking's organic growth has trailed industry averages, primarily due to elevated colleague departures and reduced hiring during the period when the business combination was pending, 2 factors that we believe are now behind us. We continue to expect that the actions we have taken will enable us to narrow the growth gap over the course of the year, with pace accelerating in the second half of 2022 as the impacts of our actions build and headwinds subside. Overall, our outlook for Risk and Broking remains positive with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected over the longer term.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q1, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margins increasing 200 basis points to 17.2% from 15.2% in the prior year, a product of our focus on strategic priorities and cost management. We continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver on our 2024 margin goals.\nAs Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to that ongoing margin expansion. Our early efforts in this area have been very successful, and we have already surpassed our $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for the year. We are actively seeking further cost transformation opportunities, and we'll update you as those progress.\nWe had free cash flow of negative $10 million for the first quarter of 2022, a $155 million increase from free cash flow of negative $165 million in the prior year. Approximately $50 million of the increase was core free cash flow improvement while the remaining $105 million was driven by onetime items. The onetime items consist primarily of legal settlement paid -- payments made in the prior year, totaling $185 million, partially offset by a net $80 million in other nonrecurring items, such as cash inflows from now divested businesses like Reinsurance, which increased prior year free cash flow, and cash payments related to transaction and transformation costs, which decreased current year free cash flow.\nWe continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders and executed aggressively on those commitments. We paid $98 million in dividends for the first quarter of 2022 and repurchased 9.9 million shares for $2.25 billion, achieving the $4 billion near-term share repurchase target we set at Investor Day. At the end of Q1, approximately $1.6 billion remain under our current repurchase authorization. We remain committed to deploying excess capital and free cash flow into our highest return opportunities and continue to believe the return we can achieve from repurchasing shares remains highly attractive, and we expect to continue to deploy free cash flow in this manner.\nOverall, we're off to a good start in 2022. As we think about the rest of the year, we see macroeconomic challenges that will continue to create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We continue to feel positive about the investments we made in talent last year and this year. We are confident those investments will support revenue growth and that we will achieve our targets for the year.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'm pleased to be here today for my first earnings call as WTW's CEO. I've officially been on the job for about 6 weeks, and it is truly an honor to lead this company. WTW looks very different than it did over 30 years ago when I first joined the company, and it's been an extraordinary journey, one defined by continuous innovation and change.\nAs we move forward as an independent company, we recognize the need to grow, simplify and transform. Our recently refreshed brand and new magic stock ticker, WTW are key signals of this new era. Our new brand evolves our identity to both reflect our rich history and also inspire our future. We may have a new brand, a new ticker and a new leadership team to set us on a bolder path, but certain things will never change: our client focus, teamwork, integrity, respect and excellence. These are our values. They are in our DNA and at the core of everything we do. WTW leadership and colleagues are excited about this bold new approach and we hope you are too.\nI'm pleased to report that we continue to see progress in our independent path forward. As we mentioned back in October, we executed on our incentive plans which provide both short-term and long-term retention benefits, and these have been well received. We've also seen significant measurable improvements in colleague engagement.\nMeanwhile, the pace at which we've been attracting new talent to fuel our path forward has been truly impressive. We hired more people in the second half of 2021 that we hired during the entire year in 2020, and the elevated attrition levels we saw in '21 are behind us. We also made some early progress in our transformation program, which Andrew will expand upon later in the call. Last but not least, we've been steadfast in applying financial discipline as illustrated by our full year margin and year-over-year margin improvement.\nAs crude stewards of our financial assets, we plan to continue our emphasis on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, which we believe provide the highest return opportunity. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. While we have hard work ahead of us in 2022, we're kicking things off with renewed energy and conviction. Our talented colleagues will strive to meet and exceed the expectations of the clients and individuals we are privileged to serve.\nIn the current environment, our clients are striving to create continuity and clarity in an environment of ongoing disruption. Future-focused leaders acknowledge that risk has become a mainstream element of business decisions and will remain so. Today, the frequency and complexity of threats continue to increase due to factors including geopolitics, economic volatility, population health, climate change, supply chain, talent and technology.\nTo combat threats and create opportunity, organizations must connect current and future risks; act on environmental, social and governance and sustainability commitments; and build organizational resilience. The time to act is now. WTW's unique perspective connect solutions, strengthens organizations and helps clients better prepare for and thrive in an uncertain future.\nFor example, WTW designed the world's first parametric insurance solution for Belize's sovereign debt restructuring. This unique transaction includes targeted insurance protection to cover Belize's loan servicing obligation in the event of certain natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. Hurricanes can create large-scale devastation and disruption to economic activity, thereby halting development. The custom solution allows Belize to focus scarce financial resources on recovery rather than debt servicing and reflects WTW's commitment to using our expertise to shape and fortify resilience in the communities we serve.\nBefore we discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to directly address our talented and valued colleagues. We have an exciting future ahead, filled with opportunity, and I'm delighted you're here to be part of it. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, and most of all, thank you for your commitment. I'm truly appreciative of your efforts to drive our vision to be the best company in the business and achieve our full potential as One WTW. I'm proud of the company we've built, and I'm excited to be leading us through the next phase of our journey.\nSo now let's turn to our financial results. Please note that all metrics referenced are on a continuing operations basis, except where stated otherwise. As a reminder, we substantially completed the sale of Willis Re on December 1, 2021. We recorded a gain of $2.3 billion in connection with the disposal of Willis Re. That gain is included in many of our GAAP profitability measures, which we'll point out as we move through the commentary.\nOverall, our results aligned with our expectations. But to be crystal clear, they do not reflect the near- and long-term potential of this company to drive organic growth and margin expansion. As mentioned earlier, our hiring levels are among highest in recent history, and we're confident that the peak of colleague departures is behind us.\nFor the full year, we posted 6% organic revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin was 19.9%. While the results reflect the expected delay impact of disruptions experienced earlier in 2021, the underlying strength of our business and our early progress on executing our strategy gives me confidence that we remain on track to deliver strong shareholder value over the longer term.\nReported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.7 billion, up 1% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. Income from operations was $690 million or 25.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to $579 million or 21.7% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $868 million or 32% -- 32.1% of revenue for the quarter, up 170 basis points from $812 million or 30.4% of revenue in the same period last year.\nFor the quarter, diluted earnings per share, which includes discontinued operations, were $19.19 as compared to $3.66 in the fourth quarter of prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.67 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% when compared to $5.19 in the prior year.\nNow let's take a look at each of our segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider to be noncore to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation.\nThe Human Capital & Benefits or HCB segment revenue was up 3% on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2021, HCB revenue grew 3% organically. Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to increased project work in Great Britain and Western Europe. Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 6% for the quarter.\nThe increase reflects robust demand in H&B consulting and a gain recorded in the connection with a one-off book of business settlement, offset by slower growth in brokerage. The settlement relates to an isolated incident of senior staff departures earlier in 2021.\nTalent and Rewards revenue increased 3% in the quarter, following growth of 17% in Q3 and 22% in Q2. Throughout the year, this growth has represented a rebound from the 2020 slowdown in discretionary projects, plus increasing market demand, particularly for products like compensation benchmarking surveys. The lower growth in Q4 relative to the prior 2 quarters reflects the typical seasonality of compensation survey sales, which peaked in Q2 and Q3 as well as some capacity constraints for advisory services. With expectations for continued strong demand in product and advisory services and having ramped up hiring in the fourth quarter, we are well positioned.\nRetirement revenue was down 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, with increased funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America due to a reduction in work in Canada to implement regulatory changes and lower demand for bulk lump sum projects.\nHCB's operating margin was 31.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 31.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, HCB's operating margin improved to 27.0% from 26.0% in the prior year. Year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency and gains from book of business settlements, HCB's margin declined by 150 basis points for the fourth quarter but increased by 90 basis points for the full year. The fourth quarter margin declined as a result of higher expense growth driven by hiring to meet expected strong market demand as we build capacity for robust revenue growth. The full year margin increase reflects continued (inaudible) expense reduction efforts.\nHistorically, HCB has had industry-leading margins, and we believe that trend will continue. HCB's overall market tailwinds should continue to drive organic growth momentum for HCB. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on the segment remain positive, and our expectations for revenue growth are unchanged from what we communicated at Investor Day, mid-single-digit growth.\nNow let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year of 2021, CRB revenue grew 5% organically. Our hiring levels are the highest in recent history and colleague departure levels have decreased. North America's revenue was up by 4% in the fourth quarter, including gains recorded in connection with book of business sales and settlements. The book sales and settlements related to producer departures occurring earlier in 2021.\nInternational's revenue increased 10% compared to prior year. There was strong performance in M&A in Asia and Australasia and natural resources in Eastern Europe. Latin America also contributed to international revenue growth with new business wins in Brazil and Central America. Great Britain's revenue declined 5% as a result of lost business and timing. The decline reflects the delayed impact of disruption from earlier in 2021. Revenue for Western Europe was down 5% due to the departure of senior staff prior to the deal termination, which continue to pressure the business in certain geographies.\nAlthough earlier departures have hindered our growth for several quarters, we are seeing some positive momentum. New client wins include one of the largest commercial and retail banks in the region.\nCRB's operating margin was 31.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 32.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, CRB's operating margin improved to 23.0% from 21.2% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency and the benefit of booking business sales and settlements, the margin declined 240 basis points for the fourth quarter, but increased by 80 basis points for the full year.\nThe fourth quarter decline was mostly due to investments to support future growth. The full year margin expansion reflects the continuation of effective cost management. CRB's organic growth trailed industry expected averages for the last 3 quarters of '21 primarily as a result of elevated colleague departures and reduced hiring during the period when the business combination was pending, 2 trends that we believe are now behind us.\nCurrently, we expect to see lower growth in the first half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2022 as the gap versus industry expected averages narrows. While events in previous quarters have challenged us and temporary headwinds from those events remain, our outlook for CRB remains positive with mid-single-digit revenue growth over the longer term.\nTurning to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance or IRR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $199 million, an increase of 32% on an organic basis and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. IRR revenue includes a gain from a book of business settlement, which relates to reinsurance assets that did not transfer in connection with the sale of Willis Re.\nIRR excludes all other revenue associated with the reinsurance line of business, which has been reported as discontinued operations. It also excludes revenue from Max Matthiessen, which was sold in September of 2020; and Miller, WTW's wholesale broking subsidiary sold in March of 2021. These sales account for the wide disparity between organic and constant currency.\nThe Insurance Consulting and Technology, or ICT business, where revenue was up 5%, led the segment's growth with increased demand for advisory work alongside technology sales. Our investment businesses grew revenue by 11% from new business, growth in delegated assets under management and, to a lesser extent, increased performance fees.\nIRR's operating margin was 25.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 12.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, IRR's operating margin improved to 19.5% from 14.5% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency and the benefit of book of business settlements, the margin declined 240 basis points for the quarter, but increased by 220 basis points for the full year.\nThe fourth quarter decline was primarily caused by the headwind created from divestitures. The prior year fourth quarter margin includes the contribution of the now divested Miller subsidiary while the current year fourth quarter margin does not, which distorts comparability. Miller subsidiary was sold in March of 2021. The full year margin expansion was the result of careful cost management efforts, combined with strong top line growth from the 2 businesses that remain an IRR, ICT and investments.\nTurning to the Benefits Delivery & Administration segment, or BDA, revenue increased by 5% on an organic and constant currency basis from the prior year fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace due to a favorable shift in the revenue timing for our B2B Medicare Exchange business, along with continued strength in our direct-to-consumer business. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed significantly to BDA's revenue growth with increased project work driven by temporary federal policy changes expecting group health care plans.\nBDA's operating margin was 49.2% in the fourth quarter and 22.4% for the full year, having declined year-over-year by 110 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. The year-over-year margin decline for both the fourth quarter and the full year was the result of increased investing in resources for the 2022 annual enrollment period, coupled with headwinds on lead conversions. The BDA segment has posted 10% organic growth for 2 consecutive years, and we continue to feel positive about the momentum of this segment.\nOverall, our financial results for 2021 are in line with our expectations reflecting the complexity of navigating a significant strategic shift along with some bright spots, highlighting our commitment to profitable growth. I'm pleased we effectively managed our cost and delivered margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite top line growth pressures.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate my gratitude to our colleagues and also thank our clients and shareholders for their support. I believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to reinvigorating growth and to successfully executing our transformation plan. I am confident the best is yet to come as we fully look to lead and shape our industry going forward.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us.\nAs expected, the fourth quarter performance faced headwinds from the delayed impact of disruptions from earlier in the year. They reflect the challenges we've previously identified and are actively working to address. To that end, we continue to push forward with our strategic goals as we finished up the year and made some early progress on our transformation efforts.\nIn the fourth quarter, we incurred restructuring charges totaling $26 million. From the actions taken in 2021, we expect to have annualized savings of $20 million, primarily from the reduction of real estate costs, the benefits of which will be recognized in 2022. The $20 million gets us 2/3 of the way towards our $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for 2022.\nFor the full year 2021, we generated profitable growth, increasing adjusted operating margin to 19.9% from 18% in the prior year. The adjusted operating margin expansion was comprised of 150 basis points of underlying growth stemming from financial discipline. This was coupled with around 100 basis points of growth from gains on book of business sales and settlements, partially offset by around 60 basis point headwind from prior divestitures and FX.\nThe expansion of our adjusted operating margin, despite top line growth pressures, highlights our dual commitments to growing profitability and focusing on cost management. As a result, we continue to expect margin improvement each year as we deliver on our 2024 margin goals.\nNow I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $687 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $579 million or 21.7% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $868 million or 32.1% of revenue, up 170 basis points from $812 million or 30.4% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter.\nFor the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS from continuing operations were $4.54 and $3.62, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $5.67 per share as compared to $5.19 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. Further, discontinued operations represented a $14.64 loss on a diluted EPS basis for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a $0.04 on diluted EPS basis for the fourth quarter. Total diluted EPS, including both continuing and discontinued operations, increased to $19.19 for the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the prior year fourth quarter of $3.66.\nForeign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $19 million or 1% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter with a $0.06 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.8% versus 19.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.1%, up from the 17.6% rate in the prior year. The increase was due to the geographic distribution of profits.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion and full capacity on our undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. WTW remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We continue to have significant financial flexibility which allows us to invest in transforming the company's operations to unlock growth potential while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders.\nFree cash flow, which includes discontinued operations, was $1.9 billion in the year ended 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in year-over-year free cash flow was due to the receipt of the termination fee, net of increased transaction and integration fees of $948 million. This was partially offset by net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher compensation and benefit payments of approximately $250 million and $383 million in tax payments primarily related to the disposal of Willis Re. Absent these items, free cash flow would have been $1.8 billion, up 15% versus the prior year.\nI want to point out that we made some changes to our statement of cash flows to reflect new guidance on restricted cash presentation in FASB ASC 230. These changes consisted of revising the classification of WTW's fiduciary fund balances on a consolidated statement of cash flows for the last 3 years. These revisions had no impact to our cash flow from operating activities or free cash flow metrics.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we paid $374 million in dividends for the year ended December 31, 2021 and repurchased 7.2 million shares for $1.6 billion. We remain committed to deploying excess capital and cash flow into share repurchases. As part of our Investor Day discussion, we communicated approximately $4 billion of near-term share repurchases and a willingness to fund further share repurchases using our free cash flow unless other investment opportunities with superior return potential arise.\nAt current price levels, we believe that repurchasing WTW stock continues to be our highest return opportunity, and we have significant resources to capitalize upon that. With $1.6 billion completed in 2021 and another $1 billion completed through today, the pace of our share repurchases highlights the conviction we have in the future of WTW and the plans we laid out at Investor Day despite the current headwinds. We expect to conclude the remainder of the roughly $4 billion of repurchases as expeditiously as practical, depending on market conditions and other factors.\nAt our Investor Day, we also announced our plans to streamline the structure of our organization by changing from 4 segments to 2 segments effective January 1, 2022. We are now operating under that new structure with just 2 segments: Risk & Broking and Health, Wealth and Career. Accordingly, going forward, our financial reports, supplemental disclosures and related commentary will reflect our new structure.\nOur 2021 financial results are a reflection of our resilience and our focus on strategic priorities. Although we have had near-term business challenges, we have undeniably strong assets which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for our stakeholders. There is a lot of opportunity ahead, and we remain focused on executing our strategy and setting the path for sustainable success.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back to Carl.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Andrew. And now we'll take your questions."

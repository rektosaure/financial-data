Welcome to the MetLife Q4 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in the listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release, and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today for MetLife's Q4 2025 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I direct you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Other members of senior management are also available to participate in today's discussion. Last night, we released a set of quarterly supplemental slides, and they're available on our website. John McCallion will speak to these slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter the prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will close at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and welcome everyone to this morning's call. Last night, MetLife reported strong Q3 results, showcasing the earnings power of our diversified set of market-leading businesses and shining a spotlight on the positive impact of our new frontier strategy. The expectations we outlined in Q2 emerged in Q3 as anticipated. Most notably, underwriting results bounced back in our flagship group benefits business on normal disability experience and seasonally better dental profitability. Variable investment income posted its highest recent contribution to adjusted earnings as capital markets activity accelerated, unlocking value in private equity. Our global retirement liability origination platform is in high gear with growth in the US and the UK, as well as in Japan, where our efficient capital structure is supporting stellar sales growth. In Latin America, our innovative digital platform for embedded insurance, Accelerator, continues to attract and win over new strategic partners.\nTurning to our quarterly results, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, or $2.37 per share, up 22% per share from the prior year period. Notable items totaled $18 million, or $0.03 per share, and included our annual actuarial assumption review and a tax adjustment in Mexico. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion, or $2.34 per share, a 21% increase from a year ago. The greatest driver of our outperformance in the quarter was strong investment margins led by variable investment income, as well as volume growth across several business segments. We reported variable investment income of $483 million, above our implied quarterly outlook of $425 million, on higher private equity returns, which reached 3% for the quarter.\nWith the rebound in variable investment income, MetLife generated an adjusted return on equity, excluding notables, of 16.7%, a level more on par with the company's earnings power and near the top of our target of 15% to 17%. We delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.6% in Q3. We are well ahead of schedule with this ratio relative to our new frontier commitment, with the force multiplier effect of AI and other emerging technologies accelerating our productivity and efficiency gains. Moving to MetLife's businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $457 million, up 6% from a year ago, reflecting solid underwriting results. Disability results returned to normal, and dental profitability ramped up in Q4, consistent with its seasonal profit pattern.\nAs a result, we saw a 230 basis point sequential improvement in our non-medical health loss ratio, providing further confidence in achieving a combined 400 basis points of improvement across Q3 and Q4. In retirement and income solutions, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $423 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher variable investment income. Chariot III officially launched in Q3 with an initial reinsurance transaction of roughly $10 billion. This strategic partnership helps expand MetLife's retirement liability origination capacity in a capital-efficient manner while also generating institutional assets for MetLife Investment Management. Total liability balances in RIS were up 3%. The solid result was driven by strong general account balance growth, including structured settlement production, a record quarter for us, in fact, and volume growth in UK longevity reinsurance. We did not report any new pension risk transfer deals in Q3.\nHowever, Q4 is shaping up to be a record quarter as we've already written $12 billion of PRT transactions, demonstrating the trust the market places in MetLife. Our long-term outlook for the PRT business is positive. A few weeks ago, we released the results of our annual poll of pension plan sponsors. The survey found that 94% of those sponsors planning to de-risk their portfolios expect to fully divest in the next five years. This is the highest percentage we've recorded since we initiated the survey 10 years ago. Shifting to Asia, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $473 million, a 36% increase on a reported basis from the prior year quarter. Sales surged 34% on a constant currency basis, driven by an outstanding 31% increase in Japan.\nOur competitive Japanese product portfolio, which includes both foreign currency and yen-denominated retirement products, has gained excellent traction across our multi-pronged distribution in the country. More than keeping pace, constant currency sales in other Asia markets jumped 39%, led by Korea, China, and India. In Latin America, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $222 million, up 2%. Adjusted PFOs for the region totaled $1.7 billion, up 11% on both a reported and constant currency basis, indicative of continued business momentum across the region, most notably in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. We recently added e-commerce leader Mercado Libre as a partner on our Accelerator digital platform in Mexico and Brazil. We now have more than 20 partners across Latin America, and the Accelerator platform has generated more than $340 million of annualized premiums since its launch, another powerful example of new frontier in action.\nFinally, EMEA posted another strong quarter with adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $89 million, up 19% on a reported basis, primarily due to volume growth. As we do each Q3, we published our 2024 value of new business, or VNB, results. It is hard to overstate VNB's importance as a tool for MetLife in maintaining capital and pricing discipline around the globe. Over time, the principled use of VNB has powered our transformation into a more capital-light business, with consistent improvement demonstrated year after year. Again, the results for the past year are impressive. In 2024, we deployed $3.4 billion of capital to support new business origination. This is the highest order use of our precious capital. The capital deployed in 2024 was put to use at an average internal rate of return of 19% and a payback period of five years.\nOur success with VNB does not occur in isolation. Achieving high internal rates of return on new business with short payback periods feeds directly into our ability to produce a high return on equity and generate strong free cash flow. To that end, we continue to manage capital with discipline, protecting liquidity and balance sheet strength while returning excess capital to shareholders. Our track record is well established. We have returned almost $24 billion to shareholders through buybacks and common dividends in the past five years. Q3 was no exception. We returned about $875 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. We paid roughly $375 million of common stock dividends and repurchased around $500 million of our common stock. With approximately $150 million of repurchases in Q3, our total year-to-date share buyback is now roughly $2.6 billion.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and liquid assets at our holding companies of roughly $4.9 billion, which includes about $700 million earmarked for near-term debt maturities and is above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion. There is no doubt capital deployment and capital management have been integral to our past success and will continue to be as we push forward with the execution of our new frontier strategy. We are working hard toward the successful closing of two strategic transactions: the acquisition of PineBridge and the sale of a legacy block of variable annuities to Talcott Resolution Life. In both cases, we are fully engaged and on track to close in Q4. As we execute across our new frontier strategic priorities, we are extending our leadership in the places we have the right to win.\nUnderpinning our strategic priorities is our investment portfolio, our time-tested approach to credit, and our unwavering commitment to risk management. For 157 years, MetLife has navigated complex and evolving credit markets, delivering consistent investment results even through periods of significant volatility. Today, while the credit environment is reasonably stable and credit fundamentals resilient, we recognize spreads are historically tight and, in some ways, priced for perfection. We maintain an up-and-quality bias across our portfolio, supported by active surveillance and disciplined underwriting. Our diversified, high-quality portfolio and active risk management position us well to navigate a wide range of economic outcomes, ensuring we deliver regardless of the market environment. In closing, our Q3 results illustrate MetLife's ability to create exceptional value for shareholders and stakeholders alike and the power of the new frontier as a growth engine.\nAs we do each year, we just completed the annual pressure testing of our strategy with our board of directors and came away confident we have the right strategy for the right time. Our focus on consistent execution, steady capital management, and expense discipline will continue to strengthen and differentiate our market leadership while fueling our superior value proposition comprised of strong growth and attractive returns with lower risk. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover the quarter in more detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our Q3 results and refer to the Q3 2025 supplemental slides, which covers highlights of our financial performance, including details of our annual global actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics and our liquidity and capital position.\nBeginning on page three, we provide a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings for Q3. We have introduced a new line item, net activity attributable to ceded reinsurance arrangements, which captures the net income impact from the growing use of ceded reinsurance following the launch of Chariot III in Q3 of 2025. Much of the offsetting amounts are captured in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and primarily represent the change in unrealized gains or losses on the reinsured portfolio ceded to the reinsurer. Therefore, we believe most of the accounting for this item to be asymmetric or non-economic in nature. Additionally, the main factors contributing to the difference between net income and adjusted earnings this quarter were net derivative losses resulting from stronger equity markets, rising long-term interest rates, and strengthening of the US dollar. The net investment losses were generally in line with recent quarters.\nOverall, we continue to believe we are operating in a relatively stable credit environment. Moving to the bottom of the table, we recorded two notable items that mostly offset each other, resulting in a net increase to adjusted earnings of $18 million, or $0.03 per share. The item relates to the resolution of an industry-wide tax matter in Mexico regarding the value-added tax deduction of certain health insurance claims expenses. This resolution and related change in tax law resulted in an after-tax charge of $71 million in Q3 2025 in Latin America. We anticipate an additional after-tax charge of $20 to 25 million in Q4. For 2026, we estimate a reduction in Latin America adjusted earnings of roughly $50 to 60 million as we recalibrate our underlying rate assumptions in Mexico, with little to no impact in 2027 and beyond.\nThe second item relates to our annual actual assumption review, which increased adjusted earnings by $89 million. Turning to page four, we provide additional details of these effects on adjusted earnings and net income by segment. The overall impact from the annual review was modest. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, our payout annuity business benefited from higher mortality. Within Asia, we recognize more favorable experience in Japan due to lower morbidity in accident and health products and favorable lapse experience in life insurance. In MetLife Holdings, we had favorable mortality in life insurance and favorable lapse rates in variable annuities. Next, let's look at adjusted earnings by segment on page five. This shows Q3 over year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment, corporate, and other. All my comments related to this slide will be made on an ex-notable basis.\nAdjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. This was primarily driven by higher variable investment income and strong volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting and lower recurring interest margins when compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.34, up 21%. Growth was supported by disciplined capital management. Moving to the businesses, group benefits results showed steady growth and improved margins. Adjusted earnings were $457 million, up 6%. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable life underwriting. The group life mortality ratio, excluding the assumption review, was 83.3% for the quarter, which is below the bottom end of our 2025 target range of 84% to 89%, but less favorable than the 82.4% on the same basis in the prior year.\nThe non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5%, modestly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 69% to 74%, and essentially flat to Q3 2024 of 72.4%. This result represented an improvement of 230 basis points sequentially from the Q2, primarily due to the anticipated dental seasonality and an expected recovery in disability. We continue to expect our non-medical health ratio to improve further in Q4 due to typical lower seasonal utilization in dental. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3%, which was dampened by approximately one percentage point due to the impact on premiums from participating life contracts. In addition, sales were up 5% year-to-date due to growth across most products. RIS maintained a strong momentum coupled with higher investment income. Adjusted earnings were $423 million, up 15% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, or VII.\nRIS investment spreads were 131 basis points, up 29 basis points sequentially due to higher variable investment income. RIS spreads excluding VII were up one basis point sequentially at 102 basis points. In addition, the transfer of approximately $10 billion of RIS liabilities to Chariot III in Q3 2025 resulted in a reduction in adjusted earnings, which was in line with our prior guidance of $15 to 20 million per quarter. RIS continues to achieve strong business momentum. Adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, were up 14%, primarily driven by higher structured settlements, and UK longevity reinsurance sales. In addition, our spread earning general account liabilities grew 4% year-over-year, while total liability exposures grew 3%. And as Michel mentioned, we've already secured a record level of new PRT mandates so far in Q4. Turning to Asia, the segment displayed strong performance across all key metrics.\nAdjusted earnings were $473 million, up 36% and up 37% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income and volume growth. Additionally, results were positively impacted by a $30 million after-tax benefit from a model refinement applied to accident and health products in Japan. General account assets under management at amortized costs were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% on a constant currency basis. Sales in Japan, our largest market in the region, were up 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by product launches and enhancements earlier in the year. Other Asia markets also contributed meaningfully, with sales up 39% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, led by Korea and China. Latin America had solid top-line growth and resilient earnings.\nAdjusted earnings were $222 million, up 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth across the region. In addition, a favorable Chilean and Cai return of 6% contributed to LATAM's solid performance, although it was below the 8% earned in Q3 of 2024. Latin America's top line continues to perform well. Adjusted PFOs were up 11% on both a reported and constant currency basis, and sales were up 15% on a constant currency basis, with strong growth across the region, most notably in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. EMEA had broad-based volume growth, driving a double-digit adjusted earnings increase. Adjusted earnings were $89 million, up 19% and 17% on a constant currency basis.\nEMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and up 9% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 24% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strength across most markets led by Turkey, Gulf, and the UK. MetLife Holdings delivered adjusted earnings of $190 million, up 12%, primarily reflecting higher variable investment income. Corporate and Other reported an adjusted loss of $288 million for Q3 2025, compared to a loss of $249 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by market-related employee costs as well as higher interest payments on outstanding debt. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24%, which is at the bottom end of our 2025 guidance range of 24% to 26%.\nOn page six, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past five quarters, including the Q3 of 2025, which was $483 million, above our implied quarterly guidance of $425 million. Private equity returns of 3% in the quarter drove the outperformance, while our real estate and other funds yielded an average return of approximately 50 basis points. As a reminder, PE and real estate and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Page seven presents post-tax variable investment income by segment and corporate and other, covering the last five quarters. Each business segment maintains a distinct investment portfolio, carefully matching its liability profile. The majority of VII assets are concentrated in Asia, RIS, and MetLife Holdings, reflecting the long-term nature of these obligations. As of 30 September 2025, total VII assets stood at approximately $19 billion.\nAsia represented over 40% of these assets, while RIS and MetLife Holdings accounted for about 30% and 20%, respectively. This distribution underscores our strategic approach to asset allocation, ensuring that the investment portfolios are aligned with the duration and risk characteristics of each segment's liabilities. Turning to expenses, page eight illustrates our direct expense ratio trends over time. For Q3 of 2025, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, an improvement from 11.7% in Q3 of 2024 and notably below our full-year target of 12.1%. We continue to emphasize that the full-year direct expense ratio offers the most meaningful measure of our expense management, given the inherent variability in quarterly results. However, this quarter's outcome further demonstrates our continued commitment to disciplined expense control and operational efficiency while maintaining responsible growth across our businesses.\nTurning to page nine, the chart highlights MetLife's value of new business, or VNB, metrics across our major segments, which we report annually and highlight the past five years. During 2024, we allocated $3.4 billion in capital to support new business initiatives, achieving an average unlevered internal rate of return of approximately 19% and a payback period of five years. This disciplined capital deployment generated about $2.6 billion in new business value. The 2024 VNB results underscore our ongoing commitment to investing in opportunities that deliver responsible growth and attractive returns. We view annual VNB as a key indicator of our ability to expand our ROE and accelerate free cash flow generation over time. Let me now review our cash and capital position as detailed on page 10. MetLife remains strongly capitalized, maintaining robust liquidity well above our internal targets.\nAs of 30 September, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies totaled $4.9 billion, exceeding our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion. We continue to prioritize returning excess capital to our shareholders, with total cash returns in Q3 reaching approximately $875 million, comprised of roughly $500 million in share repurchases and approximately $375 million in common stock dividends. In addition to these returns, holding company cash reflects the net impact of subsidiary dividends, debt issuances, operating expenses, and other cash flows. For our US entities, preliminary statutory operating earnings for the first nine months of 2025 were approximately $2.1 billion, with net income of $1.3 billion. Our estimated US statutory adjusted capital on an NAIC basis stood at approximately $17.1 billion as of 30 September, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter.\nWe anticipate the Japan solvency margin ratio to be around 740% as of 30 September, pending the final statutory filings in the coming weeks. Looking ahead, we are pleased with our progress toward the transition in Japan to ESR, a capital framework that closely aligns to the economic capital model we use to manage our business. Based on our initial work, we expect to report an economic solvency ratio within a range of 170% to 190% for March 2026. This ratio reflects the strong capitalization of MetLife Japan, as evidenced by its standalone AA- rating from S&P, as well as our capital management efficiency. We have yielded cash dividends from Japan, totaling more than $4 billion over the past five years. Before I wrap up, I'd like to note that starting in Q4, we plan to report MetLife Investment Management, or MIM, as its own business segment.\nIn addition, we plan to eliminate MetLife Holdings as a standalone segment by consolidating it into Corporate and Other. This new reporting structure aligns with our new frontier strategy. As part of this resegmentation, we will disclose recasted historical financial results in early January, which should allow enough time to update your models prior to our Q4 earnings call. In summary, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, underpinned by sustained momentum and solid fundamentals across our diverse set of market-leading businesses. We achieved robust top-line growth, maintained disciplined underwriting, and exercised prudent expense management, all while benefiting from higher private equity returns. Our value of new business metrics highlight our strategic and disciplined approach to allocating capital.\nBacked by a strong balance sheet and reliable free cash flow generation, we are well-positioned to achieve responsible growth and deliver attractive returns with lower risk, creating sustainable value for both our customers and shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ryan Krueger at KBW.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Life Insurance Sector, KBW\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on Asia sales. Can you provide some additional color on the strength that you saw? What were the key drivers, and what do you think, to what extent can this momentum continue going forward?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of Asia, MetLife\n\nHey, Ryan, it's Lyndon here. Look, we're really pleased with the strong quarter we've had in Asia. We've seen a 34% increase in the overall Asia market. So let me give you some more color here. Let's start with Japan. Sales were up 31% year-over-year. We've launched a couple of new products. We've got a new single premium FX Life product that we launched in April, and this product continues to do very well. In addition, we launched a new yen variable life product in August, and this too has been received very well by the market. We've also made some product enhancements. We've enhanced our single premium FX annuity product earlier this year, and this continues to do well when we compare to the prior year.\nSo if you take all the product launches we've put in place, as well as the product enhancements, combine it with our distribution strength, that's really what's driving the strong growth that we see in both our channels, bank assurance, as well as the face-to-face channel in Japan. Now, when we looked at the rest of Asia, sales there were up 39% year-over-year, and we're really seeing strong performance in Korea and China here. China sales were higher in the bank assurance channel, and that's really been driven by the fact that we've launched some new key bank partners, as well as been able to penetrate existing bank partners. In Korea, we continue to deliver consistently strong performance, and here we are showing strength in our US dollar product sales, as well as our WAN variable life product, and in the face-to-face channels. So good results overall.\nNow, looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue going into the Q4, and we expect to see full-year sales guidance for 2025. I hope that helps.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Life Insurance Sector, KBW\n\nYes, great. Thank you. And then just a quick one on expense seasonality. I think you typically do have some expense seasonality in the Q4. Can you give us any rough magnitude of what to expect there?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, Ryan, it's Michel. Yeah, look, we are really pleased with our direct expense ratio coming in well below the 12.1 target that we had set during the outlook. There is some seasonality, Q4 being somewhat higher than the Q1, Q3 but I would say that our expectation is that we will come in below the 12.1, I would say even well below the 12.1 at year-end. And two factors contributing to this, I would say.\nOne is early this year, we had asked our teams, given the uncertain environment, to tighten our belts and to see how we can manage expenses to a greater extent without sacrificing any of the investments we're making in growth and strategic initiatives. The reaction has been really great, really pleased with it. We've also asked the team to make sure that we carry some of those savings into next year and beyond. The other factor here is technology-related. Over the last five years, we've invested over $3 billion to simplify and modernize our technology ecosystem. This really has laid the foundation for us to integrate emerging technologies, including AI, into our core processes, products, and services. We've also developed a proprietary AI platform, which we call MetLife MetIQ. This platform blends generative, agentic, and classical AI capabilities that support responsible solutioning across business domains.\nSo think about app development and customer service, for example. We've also provided tools for our employees, our associates, as well as increased training. So this is all leading to both productivity gains as well as driving further efficiencies. And this is also contributing to the lower direct expense ratio that you're seeing here.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Life Insurance Sector, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Tom Gallagher at Evercore.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGood morning. The first question, just on the $12 billion of PRTs that you've won so far in Q4, is that a few large deals, several smaller ones? And can you just comment on what's happening competitively in that market to allow you to have so many wins?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of U.S. Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThank you, Tom. It's Ramy here. We're really pleased with our 2025 performance in PRT. To date, we have written more than $14 billion.\nAnd as Michel mentioned, there's $12 billion of that coming in Q4, which is making it a record for us. It's a few large deals. So as you know, we focus on the jumbo end of the market versus the small end of the market. So think of those as jumbos, not small deals. And maybe three other points just to think about and put this kind of record quarter in context for us. One is that we have distinct competitive advantages in that jumbo end of the market. It's our balance sheet size, our investment capabilities. And look, Tom, at the jumbo end of the market, financial strength, disciplined risk management, and established track record are all very important factors for plan sponsors and their advisors. And we're extremely pleased that we're winning the trust of the marketplace here and having a record quarter.\nThe two other points I'd make here as well is to also reiterate our disciplined approach to these deals. We do take an M&A lens to our capital deployment here and evaluate the risk and return of each deal. So the focus on value is very much there. And you see us also disclosing our VNB metrics, which really also encapsulates that. And for PRT, we continue to achieve ROEs in this business, which are supportive of our enterprise ROE targets. And then maybe the last point also just to put this in context, this is also a quarter where this win is a great illustration of us deploying our retirement platform and our capital strategies that we talked about at our Investor Day. So we're bringing the strength of our liability origination, our RIS platform.\nWe're using our own balance sheet, but we're also using third-party capital here to enhance financial flexibility. So think about those deals driving spread earnings for RIS, as well as additional growth and fee revenue for MetLife Investment Management. So it really ticks a lot of the boxes that we talked about back in Investor Day with respect to our strategy here.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's good color. Appreciate it, Ramy. I guess my follow-up would be for you as well. Can you just comment on what's happening underneath non-medical health on your improvement? I guess several peers have seen some volatility in group disability this quarter. Can you comment on the split between dental and disability, what you saw in Q3, and then why you're still confident that you can continue to improve into Q4?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of U.S. Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThanks, Tom. We're also very pleased with our underwriting results here in group. You saw us print a non-medical health ratio that's 230 basis points down sequentially, which is slightly above where we indicated last quarter. So just to split that out for you in terms of disability in particular and then dental, I would say the two drivers behind the sequential improvement, one is the favorable seasonal utilization pattern in dental. We did talk about that in the last quarter, and that's materialized here in Q3. We also have the benefits of our pricing actions continuing to flow through our bottom line. I would remind you that this seasonality also exists in Q4, which is why we expect to see a further improvement in this ratio come Q4.\nDisability is performing well for us. It's very much in line with our expectations. Incidents and claim severity are in line. We're seeing very strong recoveries. I would say that's an outcome of investments we've made in various capabilities and disability over a number of years. So this is coming through as well in very strong recoveries. So all in all, consistent with what we talked about in the last quarter. And so think about that 400 basis points improvement that we talked about. This 230 gets us more than halfway through in that direction of the overall 400. Hope that helps.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat does. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Suneet Kamath at Jefferies.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Just on PRT, is any of the $14 billion that you are planning to write this year going into Chariot Re? And how do we think about the difference in earnings impact if it goes in Chariot Re or if it stays on your balance sheet?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nHey, good morning, Suneet. It's John. Let's just start with we launched Chariot Re on 1 July. We transferred just under $10 billion of liabilities to Chariot Re and did all that launching in a little less than or just over a year. So we're very pleased with the progress we've made. Look, I think this comes back to our strategic approach and something we laid out in Investor Day and that Michel kind of articulated around just how we think about complementing our own capital with third-party capital. We see more growth in the retirement business. So it's hard to kind of pinpoint, is this Chariot or is it Chariot's kind of ongoing. We're always working with them. That's kind of the process. And that will be part of how we accelerate growth on our retirement platforms.\nIt's not necessarily always so perfectly aligned, and things don't always line up. So I'd say, yes, but to your answer, I think you could argue that we'll look more holistically at just our total asset growth and then use third-party capital to augment that. And then I think the comments we gave back a quarter ago in terms of the temporary impact on earnings is somewhere between $15 to 20 on a $10 billion deal. That's kind of a rough justice of an earnings impact in any one quarter. So just so you have a sensitivity. But we would expect that to be temporary in nature while we then refund that with other growth.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then I guess, Michel, in your prepared remarks, you referenced this efficient capital structure in Japan. So I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit. Is that unique to MET? And then relatedly, on the ESR, the 170 to 190, are there any adjustments that you're making to, I guess, the rules that come from the FSA? Thanks.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, it's John again. Maybe I'll just touch on that given the collective components of that question. So when we talk about the efficient structure, obviously, we're referencing we have a pretty big presence in Bermuda. So we've leveraged Bermuda for certain products. And that has helped us get to a more economic regime. We've continued to build our presence and size in Bermuda, both our affiliate and as well as, obviously, the launch of Chariot Re. So we've leveraged that framework. And then your question was on ESR, was it just how that relates to ESR? Is that what was your question? Just want to make sure I got it correct.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. No, it's the 170 to 190. Some companies have talked about company-specific adjustments that are made when they report those ratios. That's what I was going to say.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nOkay. Okay. Yeah. This has no adjustments. This is just prescribed. We're following the prescribed rules here. So that's the 170 to 190. And look, as we have operated under an economic framework, we've always used both to kind of think about our products and how we run that business. I referenced in my remarks about we've been consistently dividending, including this year out of Japan. We've had $4 billion of distributions up to the holdco over the last five years. So this is just the general range that we would expect to run this company.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Alex Scott at Barclays.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. First one on going back to group benefits. Can you talk a bit about just what you've seen in the competitive environment, pricing environment, and what you think that could lead to in terms of growth? Do you feel like at this point you can get back to a more long-term growth outlook for 2026?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of U.S. Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThanks, Alex. I would say we continue to see a market that's competitive, but a market that's rationally priced, which means we kind of always find opportunities to grow, and we grow that business while maintaining discipline in terms of underwriting and achieving our target returns. You hear us talk about that, but I think just keep in mind two specific attributes here that have sustained this competitive yet rational environment. The first is the fact that these are short-term products. So underwriting results emerge fairly quickly. This acts as a natural check, if you will, on the competitive dynamics.\nThe other is, look, customers here are looking for real solutions to help them deliver their overall talent strategies and drive business outcomes. So yes, price matters, but they're also looking for solutions that give their employees good experiences, enhances their productivity. In many instances, they're looking to transfer administrative burden in terms of leave and absence. They want to do that with a carrier that's tightly integrated with them and is easy to do business with. They want to do more with fewer. So they're looking for bundled solutions across the entire range of products. And look, we are a leader in this industry. And so we bring all of the above and more to the table, which allows us to drive good growth. And that comes through good retention, good renewal pricing. And also, we can do that while maintaining discipline.\nSo I would say all of these things are really good attributes that the market has. And we have a 4% growth rate in this quarter once you kind of net out the impact of the PAR contracts. 4% on top of $25 billion in absolute terms is a pretty significant number. And we're really pleased with the momentum that we have in this business.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for all that. Second one I have for you is just if you could give us your views on some of the comments that have been made around private credit investing and insurance recently. And I think some of the comments were focusing on private letter ratings and this idea that maybe there's ratings inflation out there. So if there's any kind of stats you can give us about your private credit book and the way that you go about applying ratings and so forth, that'd be helpful too.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Good morning, Alex. It's John. I'll start here, and maybe I'll ask my partner here to even add some color. So let me just give you some broad themes. So as Michel referenced before, first, let's just we are constructive on the credit environment right now. There's strong fundamentals. Corporate profits are strong. But as you heard from Michel, spreads are tight. So you need to be very mindful and disciplined around value and risk right now. And for us, that generally means up in quality. Even in higher-yielding strategies, we're up in quality. I did see the same referenced article that you had. And look, they were pretty generic comments.\nSo hard to kind of unpack that, and I wouldn't try to even do that here. But I think for us, if I look at just us, we're a top-tier private asset private credit manager. We've been doing this for decades. Importantly, having done this through credit cycles, right? Not everyone has done that. And these assets give us many, many benefits. And I'll ask Chuck. Chuck's our chief investment officer. And he can give us a little color on some of the specifics and how we think about underwriting.\n\nChuck Scully\n\nChief Investment Officer, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Alex. How are you? I mean, I think John's first point is spot on in that we've been a major investor in this sector for a long period of time. And I think it's important when we hear all the comments out there to understand that MIM does our own underwriting. Our primary source of credit underwriting is our own work we do. It's not rating agencies. It's not a rating letter. It's our specific underwriting. The vast majority of our corporate bonds are investment grade, 95%. The exposure that we have to below investment grade is mostly up in quality. So I think all those factors, good underwriting, good experience, focus up in quality, puts the portfolio in pretty good position.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah. Thanks for all that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will move next to Wes Carmichael at Autonomous Research.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst of US Insurance, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you. The first question I had for you was on RIS and just kind of your outlook for the base spread from here. I think, John, you mentioned it improved a basis point. But as we look forward, how are you thinking about the base spread?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Good morning, Wes. As you said, we had 131 basis points in spreads, about 29 basis points of that was VII. So we came in at 102. That was actually up a basis point from Q2 and better than our guidance we had given. We had expected some seasonality and some real estate that wasn't as severe as we thought. There was also a few other smaller favorable items that helped us maintain consistency. As you think about Q4, all else equal, we'd expect kind of a steady spread level from Q3. The one headwind we'll have to just think about or be mindful of is with the large amount of PRT mandates that we've won during this quarter, that can cause a temporary quarter headwind as you reposition assets. That could be a couple of basis points, if any.\nBut I think putting it all together, we see relatively flat. I think that would be kind of our viewpoint at this point.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst of US Insurance, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, John. Helpful. And second, I guess there's a press release out this morning from Brighthouse Financial, the company expected to be acquired by Aquarian Holdings. And I believe MIM manages a portion of assets for Brighthouse Financial. But I just wanted to see if there's any other potential impacts to MetLife. I don't think it should be AUM managed. But are there any other impacts that we should be thinking about from here?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. No, we saw the reports as well. And I think congratulations to the team. And obviously, all this was rumors until it's not. But to the extent that it's not a rumor, you know then that there was a lot of hard work that went into something like this.\nSo we're certainly happy and congratulate the team for all the hard work they went through. Look, for us, it's been a we have a great relationship with Brighthouse. We obviously have a long history with them. And so we have kind of a fond place in our heart for that relationship. But at the same time, we have some very unique asset management capabilities that we think help them achieve their strategic objectives. So the key relationship right now, to your question, is our asset management relationship. And we look forward to leveraging the partnership and working with them to help them with their strategic outcomes.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst of US Insurance, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Joel Hurwitz at Dowling & Partners.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nLead Analyst of Life Insurance and Retirement Services Research, Dowling & Partners\n\nHey, good morning. On MIM, any color on the performance of the business this year and how third-party flows have been?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nHey, Joel. Yeah. It's been a good year. To be honest, if we had to kind of unpack the first and second half of the year, the first half, just given the market volatility, was a little muted. Also, the announcement of PineBridge probably put a little bit of a slowness on things in the beginning of the year. But the teams worked tremendously hard to kind of educate the external environment. And we saw we had a strong second half. I think we're just above on total assets under management of just over 630 billion of AUM, above 200 billion on third-party assets. And the flows in the second half of the year have been very strong. So we're very excited about what's ahead for MIM. And obviously, kind of it's one of our strategic initiatives to accelerate the growth of MIM.\nThe team's been working very hard and excited to become our own segment come next year.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nLead Analyst of Life Insurance and Retirement Services Research, Dowling & Partners\n\nGot it. Then a couple on LTC. First, any material changes to the assumption set there? We've seen a couple of players have some adverse incidence trends. Not sure how that's trending for you guys. Then just any update on what you're seeing in the risk transfer market for that business?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah, sure. I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Ramy to give some thoughts on the market. Broadly, you saw our actuarial assumption review. Pretty modest, slight positive overall, some slight positive in RIS with some higher mortality benefiting there. Then in Asia, some favorable experience, some morbidity and lapse rates. Then in holdings, we actually had some favorable life experience as well, some favorable lapse experience on VA. A very, very modest LTC number of two million post-tax change. So I think the block continues to perform well. The ADE is in line with what we would typically expect. I'll turn it over to Ramy to give some color on just what he's seen in the market.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of U.S. Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThanks, John. As we've said before, we have and continue to look at risk transfer opportunities here. Clearly, very much seeing the recent risk transfer activity that's taken place. We're engaged and continue to look at that. Having said that, though, we will be very disciplined here as we explore these opportunities. We have a very well-managed book of business. It's well-capitalized and well-reserved. We continue to have a successful rate action program that's allowing us to obtain the necessary premium increases that the book needs. So as we look at any potential transaction, price is going to really matter here. And ultimately, any transaction needs to be accretive for us from a shareholder value perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nGot it. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Wilma Burdis at Raymond James.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance New York, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. Could you just discuss the forward timing of the impact of the Mexico tax law change? Thank you.\n\nEric Clurfain\n\nRegional President of Latin America, MetLife",
    "content2": "Yes. Hi. Good morning, Wilma. This is Eric. So as John mentioned, this quarter, we took a notable charge related to the change in the tax law in Mexico. So first, let me start by giving you a little bit of background on this item. So in the past few years, the Mexican tax authorities have been challenging the VAT deduction of certain insurance claims-related expenses.\nAlthough the discussions were ongoing for several years, there was really little to no progress until the past few weeks when the government and the industry reached an agreement making the change effective for 2025 and beyond. This revision to the tax law just passed the legislature last week. For MetLife, this industry-wide insurance change only affects our health product offering. The change to the VAT deductions results in notable impacts in 2025, with lesser impact in 2026. As we transition to the new rule, and then there will be little to no impact in earnings by 2027. We're already working to adjust our underlying rate assumptions for this annually renewable product, along with other management actions, which will help mitigate the impact of this transition.\nSo from our experience, also, this market has been very resilient and rational, which gives us confidence that we will work through this quickly. Our business in Mexico is strong. We have a large and very well-diversified franchise. And we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver on that strong performance. So in summary, this impact to the VAT change is isolated in nature, and it's temporary. And we expect we'll be back to our run rate and growth trajectory for the region by 2027. Hope this helps.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance New York, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then you had some positive assumption update in Asia. Is any of that potentially ongoing? Thanks.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Wilma, John. No, those are all generally one-time in nature.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance New York, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks. Great.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We look forward to engaging as the quarter goes on.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

    "content": "Q2 2025 MetLife Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 MetLife Inc Earnings Call\n\nMETNYSEAUG 7, 9:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation today on MetLife's Q2 2025 earnings call. Before we begin, I direct you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our Quarterly Financial Supplement, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Also available to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and welcome everyone to this morning's call. During Q2, we continued to navigate an evolving and dynamic economic environment while executing against our New Frontier growth strategy. We demonstrated all-weather performance and clear momentum across business segments, posting strong sales in many markets, executing strategic transactions, maintaining a laser focus on managing expenses, and returning capital to shareholders. Although Q2 does not demonstrate the full earnings power of MetLife, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the commitments of our New Frontier strategy. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the underlying momentum across our businesses as we head into the back half of the year.\nTurning to the results, we reported Adjusted Earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.02 per share for Q2. This reflects less favorable underwriting, albeit within normal fluctuations, and less favorable investment margins versus a year ago. Variable investment income, which we report on a one-quarter lag, was in line with our June disclosure. Our private equity portfolio generated a positive 0.9% return in contrast to a negative 4.6% return for the comparable timeframe for the S&P 500.\nWe anticipate a better result in Q3 and will continue with our advanced disclosure protocol. Among key performance metrics aligned to our New Frontier commitments, we generated a quarterly adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, well above our cost of capital and very near our mid-teen target range, while also absorbing below par variable investment income. We continue to focus on what we can control, actively managing our expenses while still investing for growth and achieving a quarterly direct expense ratio of 11.7%, beating our annual target of 12.1%. We generated strong free cash flow, enabling us to return roughly $900 million to shareholders in the form of common dividends, and share repurchases in the quarter.\nMoving to business segment highlights, Group Benefits adjusted earnings of $400 million were down from a record quarter in the prior year, largely due to less favorable life and non-medical health underwriting in the quarter. Although Group life underwriting was less favorable than a year ago, we outperformed relative to our 2025 outlook range, which we expect to continue for this year. For non-medical health, while still within a normal range, we saw some elevated experience in several products, which we do not expect to continue in the balance of the year. We also saw a small number of large disability claims during the quarter that can occur from time to time, which we do not believe to be a trend.\nYear to date, Group Benefits sales are up 9%, driven by growth and regional business. Adjusted premiums, fees, and other revenues grew 4% from a year ago. We continue to find new ways to grow and capitalize on market trends, including investing in tools that simplify and enable the benefits experience while creating a distribution advantage. We signed an additional strategic partnership with Workday in June to reach more employers and better serve their employees with our benefits experience platform, Upwise. In fact, 2/3 of employees surveyed have shared that Upwise makes the process of choosing benefits easier, leading to greater participation in voluntary products. In our Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, segment, we reported adjusted earnings of $368 million, mainly due to lower recurring interest margins. Total liability exposures were up 6% from a year ago and above our 2025 outlook range of 3% to 5%.\nThis was driven by outstanding growth in UK longevity reinsurance and a strong contribution from general account products. Another product line within RIS is our Funding Agreement Backed Note, or FABN business. As a pioneer in this type of spread lending, our ability to originate this business is well established. We originate at a favorable cost of funding due to the quality of our balance sheet and the breadth and liquidity of our market presence. We match our low-cost origination with our top-flight asset and liability management. We do all this while minimizing funding and maturity risks, satisfying two principal tenets of our New Frontier strategy: attractive returns with lower risk. Shifting to Asia, adjusted earnings were $350 million on less favorable investment and underwriting margins.\nBusiness momentum was particularly strong as sales rose 9% on a constant currency basis, propelled by our two largest markets in the region. On a constant currency basis, sales jumped 29% and 36% in Japan and Korea, respectively, following successful new product launches. Strong sales growth also translated into growth in general account assets under management, which rose 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Tied to this momentum, I recently visited Japan and Korea, where I had the opportunity to witness firsthand the team's energy and focus on achieving our New Frontier commitments.\nFor Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $233 million, matching the segment's all-time quarterly high result. Adjusted earnings were up 3% and 15% on a constant currency basis from the same period a year ago. Contributors included volume growth across the region, a consistent theme for Latin America, and favorable Chilean encaje returns in the quarter.\nRounding out our international markets, EMEA posted near-record adjusted earnings of $100 million, up 30% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to volume and sales growth across the region. In addition to driving organic growth across our portfolio of businesses, we are adding value through strategic transactions, including three we've announced since December: the acquisition of PineBridge Investments, the formation of Chariot Re, and a risk transfer deal with Talcott Financial Group. We are excited about the growth prospects for our expanded investment management platform with PineBridge. The acquisition has been well received by both firms' clients, and we're on track to close in the second half of this year. On 1 July, we successfully launched Chariot Re alongside our co-sponsor, General Atlantic, with an initial $10 billion reinsurance deal and more to come.\nOur strategic partnership with Chariot Re will support growth in our diversified retirement platform and generate institutional client assets under management for MetLife Investment Management. Our variable annuity risk transfer deal with Talcott is moving forward, and we're on schedule for our second half close. This transaction will positively reduce MetLife's enterprise risk associated with the capital markets. These three initiatives showcase New Frontier in action. They are closely linked and illustrate how we are already delivering on our New Frontier priorities. Significantly, they place us at the convergence of insurance and asset management and position us to leverage the full power of MetLife. Turning to capital and cash, MetLife was active with capital management in the Q2. We paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and repurchased approximately $500 million of our common stock.\nIn July, we repurchased around $140 million of our common stock, which brings our total year-to-date to over $2 billion. Since 2021, we've repurchased nearly $16 billion of our shares. We've done so consistently and evenly over that timeframe, reducing our share count by more than 240 million shares. At the same time, we continue to invest for growth, funding acquisitions like PineBridge, which is in addition to the capital we'll return to shareholders in 2025. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above the high end of our $3 to 4 billion target buffer range. We have pre-funded second half preferred stock redemptions and debt maturities totaling $1.5 billion, which are included in our Q2 cash balance.\nIn closing, this quarter showed how MetLife's diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses can deliver across economic cycles while providing a strong foundation for future financial outperformance. Our focus is unchanged, generating responsible growth and attractive returns with lower risk for our shareholders, as well as value for our customers, as we execute on the strategic priorities outlined by our New Frontier strategy. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll refer to the Q2 2025 supplemental slides, which cover highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q2. Net derivative losses driven by stronger equity markets and an increase in long-term interest rates were the primary drivers of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings in the quarter. In addition, net investment losses reflect normal trading activity on the portfolio and a stable credit environment. On page four, you can see the Q2 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment and corporate and other. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, down 16%, and down 15% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting and lower investment margins.\nThese were partially offset by volume growth and favorable expense margins year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.02, down 11% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million, down 25% from the record quarter in the prior year. The key driver was less favorable underwriting margins across life and non-medical health products compared to Q2 2024. The Group life mortality ratio was 83% for the quarter, which is below the bottom end of our 2025 target range of 84% to 89%, but less favorable than the record low mortality ratio of 79.1% in the prior year.\nThe non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.8%, modestly above our annual target range of 69% to 74%, and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 70.8%, which also benefited from a positive disability reserve adjustment of approximately $30 million after tax. While individual product experiences were elevated, they generally fell within a normal quarterly fluctuation. However, collectively, they had a larger impact this quarter. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect the Group life mortality ratio to continue its positive trend and be at or slightly below the bottom end of its annual target range. For the non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio, we expect the Q3 ratio to show an approximate 200 basis point improvement from Q2 levels.\nTurning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4%, driven by growth in core involuntary products, while sales were up 9% year-to-date, led by growth in regional business and strong re-enrollment across products. RIS adjusted earnings were $368 million, down 10% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable recurring interest margins compared to Q2 2024, which benefited from income from interest rate caps that have since matured. RIS investment spreads were 102 basis points, down 12 basis points sequentially due to lower variable investment income. RIS spreads excluding VII were flat sequentially at 101 basis points. RIS continues to achieve strong business momentum. While adjusted PFOs declined year-over-year due to strong US pension risk transfer sales in Q2 2024, adjusted PFOs excluding PRTs were up 24%, primarily driven by continued robust growth in UK longevity reinsurance.\nIn addition, total liability exposures grew 6% versus the prior year period, including 5% in our spread-earning general account liabilities. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $350 million, down 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The primary drivers were less favorable investment and underwriting margins. Higher volume growth was a partial offset. Asia's key growth metrics remain healthy. General account assets under management at amortized costs were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 9% on a constant currency basis. Japan sales were up 29% on a constant currency basis, with growth across all product categories, but mainly in life and annuities following product launches and enhancements in the Q1. Other Asia sales were also strong, but year-over-year growth was dampened by a large group case sale in Australia in Q2 of 2024.\nIn Korea, sales were up 36% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by the launch of a new single premium foreign currency annuity product in the Q1 and from continued momentum in face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $233 million, up 3% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth across the region. In addition, a favorable Chilean encaje return of approximately 5% contributed to LatAm's strong performance. Latin America's top line continues to perform well. Adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 18% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $100 million, up 30% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong volume growth across the region.\nGiven EMEA's growth in the first half of the year, coupled with improved foreign currency and interest rates, we expect EMEA's quarterly run rate to continue to run above its 2025 quarterly guidance of $70 to 75 million for the remainder of the year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 16% and up 14% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strength across the region. MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings were $144 million, down 6%, reflecting lower variable investment income, as well as the continued runoff of the business. Favorable underwriting was a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $233 million versus an adjusted loss of $220 million in the prior year period. Lower variable investment income was partially offset by favorable expense margins year-over-year.\nThe company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24%, which is at the bottom end of our 2025 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past five quarters, including `Q2 of 2025, which was $195 million. Private equity returns were 0.9%, and our real estate and other funds yielded an average return of roughly 1% in the quarter. As a reminder, PE in real estate and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. While VII in Q2 was below its quarterly guidance of $425 million, it was within the range of $175 to 225 million that we disclosed in a Form 8-K at the end of June.\nGiven the continued difficulty in forecasting VII, we plan to once again disclose preliminary information regarding our Q3 expectations for VII toward the end of September. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment and corporate and other for the past five quarters. As a reminder, each business has its own discrete portfolio lined and matched with its liabilities. Asia RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long-dated liability profiles. Of the total VII asset balances of nearly $19 billion as of 30 June 2025, Asia accounted for more than 40% of the total, while RIS and MetLife Holdings accounted for roughly 30% and 20%, respectively. Moving to expenses on page seven, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year 2024 of 12.1%, Q2 2024 of 11.9%, and Q2 2025 of 11.7%.\nAs we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuation in quarterly results. That said, our direct expense ratio in Q2 was well below our full year target of 12.1%. This strong performance provides another proof point of our ongoing expense discipline and a sustained efficiency mindset that is supported by our top line growing responsibly. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page eight. Overall, MetLife is well capitalized with more than ample liquidity. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.2 billion as of 30 June 2025, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion. We continue to consistently return excess capital to our shareholders.\nIn Q2, our total cash return was approximately $900 million, roughly $500 million in share repurchases, and about another $400 million in common stock dividends. Beyond share repurchases and common stock dividends, cash at holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, net debt issuances, and holding company expenses and other cash flows. Regarding our statutory capital for our US companies, preliminary Q2 year-to-date 2025 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, while net income was approximately $1 billion. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital on an NAIC basis was approximately $17.1 billion as of 30 June 2025, down 3% from 31 March 2025, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings.\nFinally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 710% as of 30 June 2025, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter, highlighted by strong momentum and underlying fundamentals across our portfolio businesses. While our earnings power was not fully evident this quarter, given the lower-than-expected variable investment income, we remain confident in delivering all-weather performance achieved through a position of strength, with a strong balance sheet and recurring free cash flow generation. As we embark on the New Frontier, our strategic priorities allow us to achieve responsible growth and generate attractive returns with lower risk. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star one on your touch-tone phone, and to withdraw your question, please press star one again. Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nBenefits. As we think about Q2 results across the sector, it seems like performance has been pretty mixed this quarter. So just curious if you're seeing anything that's surprising to you in terms of the elevated claims, or is this just sort of random volatility?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nHey, Suneet. Good morning. It's Ramy here. I mean, I would say we're not seeing anything that is surprising per se. So let me just give you some context on the non-medical health ratio, specifically for us, and what we're actually seeing.\nAs we stated, the ratio was pressured this quarter, and as we also stated, we expect improvements in our earnings in Q3 and further improvements in Q4. Just to give you a sense of the magnitude of the improvements, we expect to see about a two-point improvement in this ratio in Q3, as John stated, and we expect to see a further two-point improvement in Q4. Just to get to your question, the clearest way to really think about the dynamics and what we're seeing in our own book for our dental business. The results are very much running in line with our expectations. We are seeing the continued benefit from our rate actions here.\nThe other thing I would note is the dental business is returning to its well-established seasonal patterns, and with favorability coming through in the second half of the year, and in particular in the Q4. We're starting to see that come through even in July, and therefore expect to see sequential improvements in earnings. In disability, incidents and recoveries continue to be very much in line with our expectations. We continue to monitor this very carefully and continue to see both of these metrics be in line with our pricing and expectations. And similar to dental, that also continues to be the case in July. So we don't see any macro impacts here. Where you've seen, if you will, the pressure, and it is a bit of, I would say, part of the normal fluctuation in some of the other products in the non-medical health ratio.\nSo think accident, hospital, critical illness. When you look at the claims pattern here, we did experience a number of fairly small increases across each of these products, each of which was in line with our normal range that we typically see. What's different about this quarter is normally our results benefit from diversification across these products, call them puts and takes that we see each quarter. What is unusual here is that these products all moved in one direction for us. And again, very different set of products, very different set of drivers. So nothing macro here that we expect to trend over time, and therefore we think all of these are going to effectively normalize in the other quarters.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then I guess on Chariot Re and sidecars in general, we've seen a number of companies announce these things, but we haven't really seen any major deals with sort of third-party liabilities. So just wondering, I think Michel, in your prepared remarks, you said more to come. Can you just give us a sense of what your outlook is there, maybe over the next couple of quarters, and if anything kind of needs to happen in order to accelerate this growth opportunity? Thanks.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Suneet. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I mean, as we had mentioned, really sort of Chariot Re is we see it as a vehicle to enable our growth, basically, especially sort of as we see growth opportunities beyond our capital generation capabilities. If that were to happen, that's where we see the partnership with Chariot Re being helpful to us.\nAs we said, especially in these sort of early years, the intention is not to sort of look for third-party liabilities for Chariot. It would be liabilities that are originated by MetLife. And we continue to see really good sort of opportunities ahead. So as we had said before, we completed the $10 billion transaction with Chariot within the timeframe that we had discussed, and we think there will be more to come, but those would be MetLife liabilities, basically.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nHey. Thanks. Good morning. Could you give a little bit more color on the strong sales in both Japan and Korea, and your thoughts on that, if that can continue going forward?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nHi, Ryan. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're really pleased with the strong sales performance we've had in Asia, both when you look at Q2 as well as when you look at the whole first half of the year. Asia's year-to-date sales through H1 have increased 10% when you look year-over-year. When we look at Japan, in the first half we were up 10% compared to the prior year, and that's been driven primarily by the foreign currency products. So as I mentioned in the Q1 earnings call, we launched a new single premium FX product in April, and this has been really well received by the market. We continue to enhance our single premium annuity product, and we're starting to see some benefit from the yen strengthening, and this has really been a tailwind for sales.\nSo when you look at all these product actions combined with our distribution strength, this is really driving strong growth against all our channels when you look at Japan. When you get to the rest of Asia, sales there, when you look at the first half, have increased 9% year-over-year, and this is driven primarily by Korea as well as China. In Korea, now here, we're really being able to leverage what we've done in Japan. We've taken our US dollar-denominated products and taken that expertise and actually launched products in Korea, and we're actually seeing a lot of strength in our US dollar products in Korea. And the Korea sales have grown 41% when you look at the first half year-over-year sales.\nWhen you look at China, here, the sales growth is driven by the expansion in the bank assurance channel, and we've achieved this through getting deeper penetration within our existing bank partners as well as with the addition of some new bank partners. Now, when you look at the prior year quarter for the rest of Asia, we actually had a large group case in Australia in the prior quarter. So if you actually take out that large group case, quarterly sales for the rest of Asia were up 25% when you look year-over-year. Now, looking ahead through the rest of the year, we kind of expect to be at the top end of our guidance range when it comes to overall sales for Asia. So we hope that helps.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nThank you. Appreciate it. And then quick one, probably for John, just on retirement spreads. Would you expect them to continue to be stable with the first half of the year and the second half of the year?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Good morning, Ryan. It's John. Yeah. I think as you're kind of alluding to spreads, VII, they largely played out as we expected and as we discussed in the Q1 earnings call. As we head into Q3, based on the forward curve, we do expect core spreads to remain stable, although we do see a few bits of seasonality in Q3. It's interesting. RIS holds a small portion of wholly owned and joint venture real estate investments.\nJust kind of the nature of the asset class, which includes some hotels, they tend to have some Q3 seasonality, although in the past, I'm not so sure we saw it as much because there are other things like the caps and things like that that we're masking it. So we do see a few points of headwind, but we would revert back to the kind of low 100s come Q4. While we're on RIS margins, I would just call out, and just kind of referencing the Chariot point, we launched Chariot. We reinsured just under $10 billion. And so this, as the second one technically lowers our liability exposures, although we think, given the current pipeline, we expect to be within the 3% to 5% growth rate by the end of the year. But I should point out a couple of things.\nOne, initially, enterprise earnings will have a few pennies of impact until that excess capital is redeployed. Once that's redeployed, you think of it as being accretive to earnings. And then within RIS itself, because it's a mix of RIS, the MIM fees, also our investment in Chariot Re, so that all nets to a few pennies. But within RIS itself, we could think of another $15 to 20 million short-term headwind there, considering the loss of earnings from the reinsurance. So just wanted to kind of wrap that in there from an outlook perspective.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks. That was helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Sir, your line is open.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. First, Ramy, just a follow-up on non-medical health. So I think the disability pressure you saw this quarter came from high net worth. Unum seemed to see something similar. Have you done any more analysis on what's going on there, whether something could be structural, like mental nervous claims, employment-related, or that is mainly permanent disability? Just want to get a better sense for is that something you've even really looked into? And then just remind us how big disability is as a percent of total earned premium versus dental, just to size the two of them. Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nSure, Tom. So we definitely did look into it, and we are really talking here about two clients, which are specialty clients. These are clients that have been with us for a very long time, and the economics of these have been accretive to us. They're really related to injuries, which have very high claim amounts and has nothing to do with any of the other macro factors or any of the other potential causes that you've mentioned there.\nSo that's kind of as far as the specific kind of elevation for the quarter. In terms of the PFO ratios, think about, give or take, you've got about low digit in terms of the disability premiums as a percentage of the total. And dentals, give or take, about a $5 billion premium line for us.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nAnd sorry, Ramy, the disability, you said, is that 10% or below?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nIt's about just above 10%. It's about just above 10% of the total PFOs.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGotcha. Okay. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is just on credit, which I guess hasn't really been a focus for a while, but I noticed you did take CECL reserves for, I think it was commercial mortgage loans of around $235 million this quarter. Were those office foreclosures? Is there an impact? Was there or will there be an impact on statutory risk-based capital as a result of that?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, Tom. It's John. Good morning. Yeah. We did see an uptick in reserves, a little over $200 million in commercial mortgages. And we've anticipated some charge-offs and some losses would emerge in 2025. I think I've referenced this before, that as you start to get into the ongoing orderly resolution of loans, this typically occurs, and we believe is actually a good sign. It's usually kind of indicative that there's some stabilization in getting to the price clearing levels, and that's usually a sign where you've kind of hit the trough.\nJust to your point, so we would expect the resolution of loans to pick up this year, probably peak a little bit this year. But the reality is a lot of this is already in our capital. Maybe it's a couple to five points of extra impact, but all within the normal levels of our excess capital, and we're not impacting any capital management or dividend activity.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGotcha. Thanks for that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Good morning. So first, I just had a question for Ramy. Along the same lines on non-medical, your optimism on results getting better in the Q3, is it based on just the fact that many of these things move around quarter to quarter and this quarter was just bad, especially on the voluntary side? Or have you seen an improvement already in Q3, I guess, or almost halfway through it?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nI mean, it is both. It's based on, one, the seasonal patterns in dental, which I've talked about. So you expect seasonality to kick in in both of the subsequent quarters for dental. So Q3 will get better. Q4 gets better. So that's a big driver. The other one is lack of any macro impacts on disability. It's running right in line with our expectations. Incidents and recoveries, as I've talked about before, inclusive of July, the specialty claims that we had this quarter. We're really talking about a single-digit number of claims that are high value that had a disproportionate impact. These happen from time to time. We certainly don't expect them to happen each quarter. So none of these things, I would say, are in the optimistic bucket. They are in well-established trends and based on what we're seeing into July.\nI think this notion that those puts and takes across the rest of the portfolio are going to normalize, that kind of would be our expectation. And that's based on the fact, Jimmy, that there is no single driver. I mean, these are all different products with different dynamics in them, and we looked at them one by one, and they all happened just to move in the wrong direction for us, and we would just expect that to normalize. So you bake it all in, and as of now, we feel pretty good about the 200 basis points improvement in each of the subsequent quarters.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then I had a question for Lyndon on Asia earnings. So obviously, your sales in Asia were pretty strong. The earnings seemed a little weaker. It's, I think, the second lowest quarter you've had in the past six, and some of that might have been lower variable investment income, but earnings are lower than other quarters, even adjusted for that. So is this more of a normal quarter and representative of the division's earnings power, or were earnings depressed for whatever reason? Just trying to get a sense of, is this normal, or were you over-earning in the past?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy. Lyndon here. So thanks for the question. So yeah, you're right. Asia earnings were lower year-over-year, and there were a couple of drivers here. First, as you pointed out, lower variable investment income due to the fact we have lower PE returns. And John pointed out right at the beginning that Asia accounts now for over 40% of the VII assets in the company.\nNext, when you look at the underwriting margin, it was less favorable compared to the prior year. This is because we've got a strengthening yen, which is driving lower surrenders right now. It's creating a short-term headwind for earnings due to the overall lower surrender income. It does drive higher sales. It does drive higher AUM, and this will kind of support us as we get higher future earnings here. Relative to expectations, earnings were lower due primarily to the variable investment income. When you look at the outlook, we expect full-year underlying earnings to remain strong and in line with guidance. VII performance will continue to be a factor that will impact our overall reported earnings.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey. Thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to follow up on the last question on Japan. Just hoping maybe, Lyndon, can you unpack the surrender activity? How pronounced is that as we've seen a bit of yen strengthening? And I guess relatedly, how do we think about higher long JGB yields impacting your savings product offering there?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nYeah. All right. So Wes, just first on surrenders. So we've seen surrenders come down relative to the prior year, but persistency is back in line with our expectation right now. So the unfavorable underwriting margin compared to the prior year is really because we've got the strengthening yen, which is driving these lower surrenders. So this is creating a short-term headwind when we look at our overall surrender income. But as I pointed out, it is a good benefit when it comes to sales and AUM growth to get our future earnings. But we are seeing surrenders kind of come back down to our expectations now.\nNow, when it comes to higher yen interest rates for the Japan business, look, when you look at the overall environment in Japan, things are improving. It's a favorable macroeconomic environment, and we are seeing higher interest rates in yen. So overall, it's a positive for our business. And we've been anticipating these higher rates and been planning for it. We've got a good yen-denominated product. We've got ANH. We've got variable life segments, and these address needs when you're looking at protection as well as accumulation. And we're working on adding other product offerings. And the product economics now for yen products have really improved with these higher rates. So it gives us a lot of options when it comes to adding to the yen products.\nWhen you look at the US-denominated products there, there continues to be a differential between US dollar and Japanese yen rates, despite the fact that the yen rates are rising. So the FX products will continue to be attractive for our customers. So when you look at the overall product portfolio, you look at the strength of our distribution, you look at our ability to product launches, we're really in a good position to meet customer demand, whether it comes to yen or dollar FX products there.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nI would just add, Wes, just to Lyndon's comments, it's probably roughly $15 to 20 million relative to expectation in terms of underwriting and kind of the impact of the lower surrender fees.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYep. That's helpful. Thank you, John. Maybe just switching to a topic I guess we haven't talked about much on these earnings calls, but FABN. Michel, I think you mentioned the program in your prepared remarks, and I think you're the largest player in the market in terms of at least outstanding programs. But maybe you could touch on the outlook for that business. It looks like the industry is probably going to have its largest issuance year ever for 2025.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nHey, Wes. It's Ramy here. I would say as far as our program, we've had a very well-established program. It's about 10% of our overall general account liabilities, and we consistently issue somewhere between $6 to 8 billion a year in the market. And as Michel mentioned, we do benefit from favorable funding costs here in terms of the financial strength of our balance sheet and therefore earn relatively higher spreads compared to the rest of RIS.\nI think with respect to the overall growth in issuance, I would say this is a really good thing for us. We welcome new entrants into the market. We think it's a net positive. As the issuing grows, it also attracts more investors and establishes funding agreement back notes as an asset class that has wider appeal. And so we're actually pleased by the overall growth in the market here.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cave Montazeri from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nCave Montazeri\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nMorning. My first question is on the state of the PRT market. So Q2 wasn't your best quarter for PRT, but I appreciate that's a lumpy business, especially at the jumbo end. Just love to get some. What are your thoughts, expectations into the second half? And also, how do you think about the attractiveness of the US versus the UK PRT market?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThank you. It's Ramy here. I would say, look, Q2 was a bit lighter, but year-to-date, we wrote $2.2 billion of PRT. So we had a really good Q1. And I would say those were deals with well-established firms that you would recognize in terms of their prominence. And as we look forward to the second half of the year, we see a number of jumbo cases which are expected to transact in Q3 and Q4. Our approach here is to continue to be disciplined in terms of how we price and how we think about value versus volume. That's an approach that has served us well, and we expect to earn our fair share of the market going forward.\nAnd then the last thing I would say on the US market over the medium term, all the fundamental drivers that we've spoken about in terms of funding levels, the desire of plan sponsors to de-risk, frozen plans, all continue to give us a high sense of expectation that this is a market that's going to continue to be growing for the foreseeable future. And as you mentioned, it's always going to be lumpy. In the UK, we do participate in that market as a reinsurer, not as a primary insurer. And we do it in two ways. We do it by issuing longevity swaps. So think of that as really a fee business. And as we've been very successful at that from a standing start, we've got $30 billion of balances.\nAs we've talked about late last year, we're now also participating in that business on a funded basis, as in we're providing, think of it, reinsurance on a fully funded basis. So think of it as US PRT, but on a reinsurance basis. And the same dynamics in the UK market are playing in the US market, rather, are playing in the UK market. So well-funded plans, they look to exit, I would say, more limited capacity in terms of insurance capital there, and hence the need for reinsurers like us with strong balance sheets, strong counterparty credit risk protections. And we expect to see nice growth there as well.\n\nCave Montazeri\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. My follow-up is on GenAI. Could you give us an update on your implementation of GenAI in your processes? Which parts of your business do you think can benefit most from GenAI, not just to improve efficiencies, but also to drive growth?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYes. Hi, Cave. It's Michel. Thank you for the question. Yeah, I think we're sort of really excited about the potential of emerging technologies, broadly speaking, AI in particular. And as we discussed at Investor Day, we view technology as a key enabler of our New Frontier strategy. I would say scale is important and matters here, and our scale has enabled us over a number of years of making important investments in this space. Those investments have been helpful to us from an efficiency perspective, as well as in terms of enabling our growth.\nA few things that I think position us really well in terms of taking advantage of AI and of emerging technologies is one, that we've been on a multi-year journey to modernize our legacy systems here, also in improving and enhancing the quality and the governance of our data. Also, we've been on a multi-year journey to re-engineer and, in some cases, reimagine a lot of our key processes here. Those are important because for AI and emerging technologies to really be force multipliers, you have to inject them into contemporary processes and a sort of a modern infrastructure and systems. And I would say also the continued evolution of our culture here is important because we've been promoting a culture of experimentation, of challenging the status quo at all levels of the organization.\nSo all these things taken together, along with a mindset that views AI as a disruptor to many industries, including our own, in a positive sense, have led us to be early adopters. We've implemented a number of not only experiments, I would say. A lot of these are now in full production mode, both from a productivity and efficiency perspective, as well as in terms of the customer experience and enabling growth as well. We're seeing really good results and traction here. I think we're still in the early days of what this technology is really going to deliver for us. But we certainly feel really good about how we're positioned, including sort of the partnerships that we've established.\nSome are well-established partnerships with key players in the space, but also a lot of partnerships with more specialized players that provide us with plug-and-play type solutions as well. The areas where we are seeing big impacts, I would say, already are in the programming space, application development, if you like, call centers, claims as well, but many others. It's a good balance between productivity and efficiency as well as growth-oriented initiatives. I hope this helps.\n\nCave Montazeri\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's good color. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, just on holdings, we've seen some recent deals transacted within the long-term care space. Just wanted to get some updated thoughts on whether Met would potentially consider transacting with its block, and then are there other blocks that you're kind of looking to dispose of within holdings?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThanks, Elyse. It's Ramy here. I would say with respect to LTC, we are clearly seeing the same activity that you're seeing. And the fact that you're seeing more activity tells you there's more of a convergence, if you will, between cedants and reinsurers, which is encouraging. I would say, as you know, these are complex transactions to execute, and we continue to be looking at them and in active dialogue in terms of price discovery as well as structure discovery. But these are complex. They take time. And our objective is always going to be the same. We want to maximize shareholder value and continue to serve our customers.\nFor us, price as well as structure matters. In the interim, when we look to our book, it's well-capitalized, well-reserved. It continues to perform in line with our expectations. We have a really successful rate action program that's allowing us to obtain the necessary premium increases as well in the marketplace. So that's kind of where we stand today. With respect to other holdings transactions, we are expecting to close the Talcott transaction in the second half of the year. And we're going to be continuing to explore other risk transfer opportunities there going forward.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. My second question, just in regards to recent health insurer adverse performance, some companies have said that if it's an incidence versus severity issue, you could start to see impacts to supplemental health businesses. Is this something we're beginning to see here with your business?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThese are really distinct patterns here. So we're not in the major medical business. There is no real trend impact on us. All the claims that we have in our voluntary suite of products are fixed dollar claims. And then with respect to kind of the incidence, I would say what we've seen is very much in line with normal deviations that we would see, fluctuations that we would see in any given quarter. And if I were to give you just a bit more color on that, the one that you may have heard in the medical space is cancer, and our critical illness product is actually running in line with expectations. So we're not even seeing any adverse incidents there.\nSo I wouldn't try to extrapolate from what's going on in the medical world into the voluntary world from what we can see in our book at the moment.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our question comes from the line of Joel Hurwitz from Dowling. Please go ahead.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nLead Analyst, Dowling",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning. Ramy, one more for you on group. You had really strong sales in the quarter, and you guys had highlighted regional business growth. Can you just provide some more color on the growth you're seeing in that regional market, and maybe provide some color on the competitive landscape there?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nSure. So look, from a competitive perspective, we operate in a competitive, but I would still say rational market. And therefore, we compete based on a whole set of factors beyond price in terms of our capabilities, employer-employee experience, connectivity into the overall ecosystem, and relationships with the brokers that are very well established. So we really like the basis of competition in this business, and that's true up market, and it's also true in regional markets. I would say from an overall growth perspective, you saw a 9% increase year-to-date from a sales perspective. Regional is a very important contributor of that, in particular because we had a slower jumbo year this year versus last year. So regional continues to be a significant contributor when you think about our year-to-date sales growth.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nLead Analyst, Dowling\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then just going to LatAm, the top line is running well ahead of your guidance. I guess just what's fueling the better-than-expected growth again in 2025?\n\nEric Clurfain\n\nRegional President of Latin America, MetLife\n\nYes. Hi, Joel. This is Eric. Yeah. So as we outlined at Investor Day, LatAm is a growth engine for the enterprise, and we've been delivering high single-digit growth in both top and bottom line in the past few years, double-digit if you look at it from a constant currency perspective. And that's solid performance so far this year with premiums growing at a healthy double-digit as well on a constant currency base. And as we discussed, the business fundamentals of our franchises across the region are very strong, and we're well-positioned to extend our growth trajectory into this year and beyond. Just to give you a little context about LatAm, we're the largest life insurance company in the region. We have a strong franchise. We serve close to 30 million customers.\nWe operate in six markets, which are the most relevant ones: Mexico, Chile, where we are number one leaders, in Brazil, where we are the fastest-growing company there. We are very well-diversified in terms of products as well as distribution channels. We have a network of above 10,000 agents across the region in our face-to-face business. We're also the leading employee benefits provider to large employers as well as SMEs, offering a wide variety of life and health products. Our fastest-growing channel in the past few years has been our third-party distribution channel, where we distribute products through a variety of over 100 partners, such as banks, retailers, clinics, utility companies, among others. In the past few years, we've witnessed significant growth through the rapid emergence of these digital ecosystems, whether that be digital banks`, digital retailers, and a wide variety of e-commerce ecosystems.\nTo harness this opportunity, we launched Xcelerator a couple of years ago. This is really our regional embedded insurance, fully end-to-end digital. We've already integrated 21 partners. We've issued above $300 million in PFOs since the launch. We're serving five million customers on that platform. This is growing really fast, and we're partnering with important players across markets, and continue to scale that business to capitalize on our competitive advantage. It's such a really long summary about LatAm, but I think it was important to put things in context that this doesn't come from a specific country. Growth doesn't come from a specific line of business, but all lines are contributing to the growth today and moving forward. Hope this helps.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nLead Analyst, Dowling\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, Eric.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Unfortunately, we don't have time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Hall for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning, and we look forward to engaging throughout the quarter. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining the call today. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements, yesterday's earnings release, and two risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Q1 2025 earnings call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nOn the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as the risk transfer transaction we also announced yesterday.\nThey are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michelle.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. A few months ago, we rolled out our new frontier strategy to guide MetLife over the course of the next five years. As you will recall, a keystone of our new frontier strategy is the all-weather nature of our market-leading set of businesses. And once again, after powering through the supply and mortality challenges of COVID and then bank liquidity concerns, we find our strategic diversification put to the test.\nAs we move through 2025, with the odds of a recession on the rise, we are seeing unprecedented volatility in the daily trading of the US equity markets. We are also seeing interest rates rise on the long end of the curve, fall in the middle, but Fed funds still remain high at the short end. Meanwhile, after a historic run of strengthening, the US.\nDollar has started to weaken against many currencies around the world. Although MetLife is not immune to the impacts presented by this uncertain backdrop, we are confident we have the right businesses and the right strategy to meet the moment. At our core, MetLife is a recurring revenue business model.\nIn any given year, the vast majority of the revenues and earnings we generate are a function of renewal premium or investment income from assets and liabilities that are already on our books. While a slowing economy can dampen growth for our group benefits business, we've not yet seen cracks in the job market. Further, the primary profit driver, mortality, for our largest group product line, Group Life, is largely uncorrelated to the economy.\nFor our retirement and income solutions business and our investment management business, higher long-term interest rates are helpful on the demand side. The underlying growth of our international businesses, which has been partly masked by the strong dollar, could start to emerge as a tailwind. Standing behind it all, our investment portfolio has been risk-off for several years and is well-situated to absorb recessionary stress.\nOur positive track record on this front is well-established. Over the course of our 157-year history, we have seen challenging times before and have succeeded in driving long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders, and we are well-positioned to do so again. Let me now turn to our Q1 results, which we reported last night. I believe they reflect the resilience of our business model and underscore many of the points I just made.\nWe reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, or $1.96 per share, up 7% from the same period a year ago. We saw favorable underwriting, good volume growth, and better variable investment income in the quarter, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and recurring interest margins. Variable investment income was aided by the performance of our real estate funds, which continued their steady recovery.\nPrivate equity funds gained 1.6% in the quarter, which is below our implied quarterly outlook return. Our adjusted return on equity in Q1 was 14.4%, and our 12% direct expense ratio is evidence of our efficiency mindset at work. Shifting to business segment results, our group benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $367 million, up 29% from the prior year period, on favorable life underwriting margins due to lower mortality.\nWe continue to see favorable mortality for the working-age population, which is consistent with CDC data. Moving to retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $401 million in the quarter.\nSales of Synthetic GICs and UK longevity reinsurance were strong in the quarter, and inflows associated with pension risk transfers totaled $1.8 billion, an outstanding start for the year. Our liability exposures are up 8% from a year ago. Looking to Asia, adjusted earnings were $374 million, down 12% over the same period a year ago, on lower underwriting margins and higher taxes. Sales for the region were up 10% on strong volume growth in Korea and China.\nSales in Japan have started to turn the corner, and we are seeing very good energy around a new US dollar-denominated product that we introduced in the BankApp channel at the end of the Q1. Turning to Latin America, adjusted earnings were $218 million, down 6% from the year-ago period, though foreign exchange rates played a role.\nOn a constant currency basis, our adjusted earnings were up 7% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted PFOs in the region tell a similar story, up 1% on reported basis, but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Overall, we continue to see strong momentum across our leading markets in Latin America. Since launching our new frontier strategy in December, we have been laser-focused executing on its key pillars, and we are already making meaningful progress.\nI'd like to expand by providing two related proof points. We were pleased to announce last night another significant risk transfer deal, particularly given the current economic landscape. We have entered into an agreement with Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company to reinsure approximately $10 billion of US retail variable annuity and rider reserves.\nConsistent with our long-term objectives, the planned transaction will accelerate the runoff of MetLife's legacy business, positively reduce the company's enterprise risk, and substantially lower the company's retail variable annuity tail risk. For its part, MetLife Investment Management is on an aspirational path to $1 trillion in total assets under management.\nWe have integrated the teams from Mezzaroh that we acquired in the quarter, and we are working at pace to close our roughly $100 billion AUM acquisition of PineBridge, a substantial down payment toward achieving our aspiration for MIM. Turning to capital and cash, in Q1, we accelerated our capital management activity, returning around $1.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases.\nWe paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million and repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common shares. The above-average buyback pace was a function of fewer repurchases in the Q4, as we were locked out of the market due to pending announcements. We expect subsequent quarters this year to be at a more measured pace. Following our new $3 billion repurchase authorization that was announced last night, our total board authorization is now about $3.4 billion.\nIn recognition of our financial strength and flexibility, our board of directors increased our common dividend per share by 4.1% last week. Further adding to our financial flexibility, we were active in the debt capital markets in the Q1, issuing $1.25 billion of pre-capitalized trust securities, as well as $1 billion of subordinated debt. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion.\nShifting to governance, we announced in February that Christian Mumenthaler will be joining our board of directors effective 1 May. Prior to joining our board, Christian had a distinguished career at Swiss Re, culminating in an eight-year term as Group Chief Executive Officer. We are glad to have someone with his skill set and experience on our board as we drive our new frontier strategy forward.\nIn closing, the underlying fundamentals of our portfolio of businesses remain strong, as evidenced by our solid Q1 performance. While the operating environment may present challenges, we have emerged stronger from prior periods of turmoil. We've done this by following a playbook that focuses on the levers we control, like discretionary expenses, without sacrificing investments in strategic growth initiatives.\nWhen we set our new frontier goals, we were under no delusion that it would be easy. One of the things that gives me confidence in our ability to succeed is the team here at MetLife. For the third year in a row, we are proud to have been named among the 100 best companies to work for by Fortune. Our team is energized and engaged.\nThat leaves me convinced that our people are up to the task at hand, driven and motivated to deliver on MetLife's superior value proposition of responsible growth, attractive returns, and lower risk. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. I'll refer to the Q1 2025 supplemental slides, which cover highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. We have also included a few slides summarizing our variable annuity reinsurance transaction announced yesterday. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q1.\nWe had net derivative gains, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Chilean peso versus the US dollar, as well as unfavorable equity markets. That said, derivative gains were mostly offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement losses due to lower interest rates and weaker equity markets in Q1 of 2025. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio, and credit remained stable.\nOn page four, you can see the Q1 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment and corporate and other. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 1% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. While foreign currencies strengthened against the US dollar in the current quarter, most major currencies weakened year-over-year.\nThe positive year-over-year drivers were favorable life underwriting, higher variable investment income, and solid volume growth across most business segments. These were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, up 7% and up 11% on a constant currency basis, aided by strong free cash flow and robust capital management over the prior four quarters.\nMoving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $367 million, up 29% from the prior year quarter. The key driver was favorable life underwriting margins due to working-age mortality improvement compared to the prior year period.\nThe Group Life mortality ratio was 84.8% for the quarter, which is at the bottom end of our 2025 target range of 84% to 89%, and better than the winter flu season expectations. We continue to see post-COVID favorable mortality trends in the working-age population, consistent with CDC data. The non-medical health interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 74.1%, slightly above our target range of 69% to 74%.\nDental utilization is seasonally highest in Q1, and we expect the ratio to be toward the middle of the target range in Q2. Turning to the top line, group benefits Adjusted PFOs were up 2% year-over-year. While mortality improvement was favorable to group benefits bottom line, it masks top-line growth due to the impact on premiums for participating life contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience, but has a limited impact to earnings for those contracts.\nRIS adjusted earnings were $401 million, up 1% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income and favorable underwriting performance, partially offset by unfavorable recurring interest margins. RIS total investment spreads were 114 basis points, up 2 basis points sequentially due to higher VII. RIS continues to achieve strong business momentum.\nAdjusted PFOs were $2.4 billion, primarily driven by strong US PRT sales in the quarter, which resulted in new inflows of $1.8 billion in Q1 2025. Excluding PRTs, RIS Adjusted PFOs were up 14%, primarily driven by continued growth in UK longevity reinsurance, as demonstrated by one jumbo case sold in the quarter with a contract value of $1.7 billion. In addition, total liability exposure grew 8% versus the prior year period, most notably up 7% in general account liabilities.\nMoving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $374 million, down 12% and down 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins and an adjustment of a deferred tax asset to reflect an increase in Japan's effective tax rate. This reduced Asia's adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher VII year-over-year. Asia's key growth metrics remain healthy.\nGeneral account assets under management at amortized cost was up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis. While Japan sales were down 8%, as foreign currency products remain under pressure given ongoing yen volatility, other Asia sales were up 41% on a constant currency basis, most notably with the strong growth in Korea and China.\nLatin America adjusted earnings were $218 million, down 6%, but up 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher volume growth across the region and favorable tax items in the quarter. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins, as well as lower Chilean and Mexican returns compared to a strong Q1 2024.\nLatin America's top line continues to perform well, although reported growth rates are being masked by currency headwinds, most notably due to the weakness in the Mexican peso year-over-year. Adjusted PFOs were up 1%, but up 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth and solid persistency across the region.\nAMIA adjusted earnings were $83 million, up 8%, and up 14% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth, partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year.\nAMIA Adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 12% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $154 million, down 3% due to the runoff of the business. We continue to look for opportunities to optimize this legacy block of business through risk transfers.\nAs announced yesterday, we have entered into an agreement with Talcott Resolution to reinsure approximately $10 billion of US retail variable annuity and rider statutory reserves. I will provide more details on that transaction shortly. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $248 million versus an adjusted loss of $241 million in the prior year.\nLower net investment income was partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23.2%, modestly below our 2025 guidance range of 24% to 26%.\nOn page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the fours quarters of 2024 and Q1 of 2025, which was $327 million. This result was up sequentially, but below our implied quarterly run rate of $425 million. Private equity returns were 1.6% in the quarter, and our real estate and other funds yielded an average return of roughly 2% in the quarter.\nAs a reminder, PE and real estate and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Looking ahead to the Q2, we plan to disclose preliminary information regarding our expectations for the variable investment income in the early part of July. We are doing this for the Q2 given the current environment. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment and corporate and other for the Q4 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025.\nAs reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profiles. However, as a reminder, each business has its own discrete portfolio aligned and matched to its liabilities. Moving to expenses on page seven, this chart shows a comparison of direct expense ratio for the full year 2024 of 12.1%, Q1 2024 of 11.9%, and Q1 2025 of 12%.\nAs we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. That said, we believe our results in Q1 position us well to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.1%, demonstrating our ongoing expense discipline and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page eight.\nOverall, MetLife is well capitalized with more than ample liquidity. We opportunistically repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares in Q1 and have repurchased approximately $150 million of our shares in April.\nAs we announced yesterday, our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, reflecting the collective confidence in our new frontier strategy and the strength of our balance sheet, as well as management's commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nCash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.5 billion at 31 March, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion. Beyond repurchases, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and holding company expenses and other cash flows.\nIn addition, we had a $1 billion subordinated debt issuance and redeemed $500 million of maturities in the quarter. Regarding our statutory capital, for our US companies, our 2024 combined NAIC-RBC ratio was 388%, which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our US companies, preliminary Q1 2025 statutory operating earnings were approximately $600 million, while net income was approximately $500 million.\nWe estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $16.4 billion as of March 31, 2025, down 6% from year-end 2024, primarily due to dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\nBefore I wrap up, let me comment on the risk transfer transaction that we announced yesterday, highlight shown on page nine. As we have discussed in the past, MetLife Holdings is a well-seasoned and well-diversified legacy block. We continue to focus on our primary objectives to meet customer obligations, look for efficiencies in how we operate, and seek opportunities to further optimize the business.\nAs we have noted, we have continued to take a third-party perspective, which helps us better manage the business internally, while also providing us optionality to appropriately accelerate the release of reserves and capital at the right value with the right strategic partner.\nThis transaction with Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company covers approximately $10 billion of current US retail variable annuity and rider statutory reserves via funds withheld for the general account reserves and modified co-insurance for the separate account liabilities.\nThis risk transfer significantly lowers our exposure to retail variable annuity tail risk by reducing account values by approximately 40%, which in turn would positively reduce our enterprise risk associated with capital markets and its related volatility. It is expected to deliver approximately $250 million in statutory value, consisting of a seeding commission, and release of capital over time.\n.Also, we expect the transaction will result in foregone adjusted earnings in MetLife Holdings of approximately $100 million annually. However, this will be offset by an annual hedge cost savings to the enterprise of roughly $45 million associated with this block of business.\nIn addition, we have secured investment management mandates for MetLife Investment Management to manage roughly $6 billion of assets with Talcott, which supports our strategy to expand third-party fee income. Turn to page 10.\nYou can see how our VA balances have declined over time, consistent with our strategy. At our 2024 Investor Day in December, we highlighted the left side of the chart showing the 26% drop in VA balances over the five-year period from 2019 through 2024. As shown on the right side of the chart, we expect total VA balances will further decline to $24.5 billion as of 31 March 2025, reflecting the reinsurance transaction with Talcott.\nOverall, this represents a more than 50% decline in VA balances since 2019, a positive development for MetLife's risk profile. In addition to lower balances, it is also important to note the remaining product mix, which will include a significant portion of traditional group retirement variable annuities of roughly $9 billion. These include 403(b) and 457(b) annuities for retirement plans, which have limited guarantees.\nLet me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter, reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals across our portfolio businesses. While the environment remains uncertain, we remain confident in delivering all-weather performance achieved through a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation, and a diversified set of market-leading businesses.\nAs we embark on the new frontier, our strategic priorities allow us to accelerate responsible growth and generate attractive returns with lower risk. Our variable annuity reinsurance transaction with Talcott is another proof point of how MetLife has both the tools and commitment to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue.\nIf you'd like to withdraw that question, press star one again. Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. I had a question first on your spreads in the RIS business. If you look at the base yield, it was down, I think, around 11 basis points sequentially, around 13 basis points year-over-year, and spreads were down 17 basis points almost a similar amount. So not sure if that's mix or I know you had interest rate gaps that you might not be benefiting from, but what's driving that? And should we assume a further decline or stabilization in spreads from these levels?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy, it's John. This answer probably requires a little bit of a holistic view of RIS. I'll give you the punchline upfront.\nWe did have a decline sequentially in spreads, a function of rates and curve, offsetting that as growth. So let me give Ramy a chance to just talk about some, I'd say, growth-exceeding expectations, and then I'll come back and talk about spreads.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy. Thank you, John. Just to give you a sense of the growth momentum this quarter, you can see it on our balances year-over-year and sequentially, but we've got a number of notable wins in the quarter. We've got a very strong Q1 for PRTs with $1.8 billion of inflows.\nI would note, Jimmy, that all of these transactions were with sponsors who are Fortune 500 companies, which is really encouraging for us. We talked back in December about the very first UK-funded redeal that we did with a well-established UK insurer. We continue to see really good momentum for us in that market.\nAlso, in the UK market, we have a very robust pipeline in the UK longevity space, and that's coming off the back of the jumbo transaction that we executed in the quarter. And then last but not least is stable value. We are a leader in that market, and this has been a very strong quarter for us, and we capitalized on some of the market disruption.\nSo you put all of these together, we're seeing really strong momentum from an earnings perspective. It's coming from investment spreads, but it's also coming from underwriting and fees over time. And you see that in the 8% growth in the liability balances.\nAnd for the full year, we expect to be at the upper end of that 3 to 5% balance growth that we guided you back in February. So this is a bit of a growth from a liability balances perspective. Maybe, John, I'll hand it back to you to talk about the spreads.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. Yeah. I just thought that maybe just setting that up to start because, as you said, we are down a bit sequentially. We did have, as you mentioned, a seven basis point decline in the core spread. When we were going through this back in February, we did expect a decline. We had the remaining roll-off of the interest rate caps. We expected that to be a five- or six-point drag, but had expected to partially offset that with certain management actions in the quarter.\nHowever, we had some rates were different. The path of rates were different. We had lower rates than expected. We had a flatter curve than expected. And so it became a bit difficult to reposition the portfolio and leverage some of our tools we had to offset that cap roll-off.\nThe second thing we had in the quarter is we had more than expected paydowns in certain structured, higher-yielding structured securities and loans. When we were redeploying that, you were redeploying that at some lower spreads, and that was in the early part of the quarter. So those two things impacted our ability to offset some of the cap roll-off in the quarter.\nBut as Ramy said, if you take growth as probably exceeding expectations, caps are coming in a little lower. They're likely going to stabilize from here into Q2. And net-net, you're effectively flat relative to earnings expectations. So hopefully, that gives a little color as to how to think about the two, so.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Then on your CRE portfolio, the main metrics are pretty similar with how they've been recently with loan-to-values and coverage ratios and stuff.\nIt seems like things were starting to stabilize, but are you seeing any indications that with all this uncertainty that the recovery is going to stall, or what are you seeing in the commercial mortgage loan book?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. It's a good question. As you said, real estate activity and office leasing, it really was continuing to show signs late in the year and even into Q1. I think our statistics show that office leasing activity in Q1 was the strongest we've seen since mid-2019. Investment activity has been up year-over-year as well, I think roughly 10%.\nSo generally, there's been some good momentum, but I would say that we'll have to just monitor kind of where we are in terms of some of the uncertainty that's out there. It might slow a little momentum.\nI think our feeling is the sector has found a trough in values, generally all else equal. We saw that in some of our LTVs and our debt service coverage ratio. But I mentioned this maybe last quarter. This year and probably next year, you will resolve a lot of the things that we put up reserves for over the last several years. So this will be kind of the resolution point, but that tends to happen at the trough. I think so we still think we're there.\nAgain, it's a bit all else equal, but we are feeling it. We saw it. Look, if you go back to VII, we had a 2% roughly return on the real estate-related funds in the quarter. So there are signs of improvement, but obviously, we'll have to just see how long the uncertainty persists.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. First question is on the risk transfer deal. I guess on its face, the pricing maybe doesn't look so great in terms of, we'll call it the earnings multiple of what you're giving up. But as we all know, this is kind of a pretty volatile higher tail risk. So I think that should be considered.\nBut can you talk a bit about the way you approached it valuation-wise? I guess you're giving up 50 million roughly of net income. How much cash flow do you end up losing? And then talk a little bit about how you viewed the tail risk, and overall why this deal made economic sense for you. Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nSure. So Tom, it's Ramy here. Let me just maybe give you a sense of how we got to the deal, and then we'll tackle some of the specific questions you had. You should definitely look at this in the context of the new frontier strategy that we talked about, in particular in the lower risk pillar of that strategy.\nWe have taken a very disciplined approach here as we looked at potential transactions, especially in the context that we have a well-seasoned and well-managed book. But for us, the goal here is to create value for our shareholders and all our other stakeholders. So the reinsurance partner matters. The structure really matters, but so does the price. And we do look at the price from a number of lenses, including an economic lens when we think about the valuation of the book.\nWe definitely have a view of that, with which the price was very much in line. We also look at it in terms of the impact, if you will, from a loss of GAAP earnings perspective versus the ceding commission. But you should look at that also in the context of the cost of hedging that we're also now no longer incurring.\nSo net-net, when you put that together, the value that we received was very much in line with our expectations. And it also removes a lot of the tail risk, which, as you know, the capital requirements for this business could be significantly higher should we see a downturn in the equity and the interest rate environment. So all of these things were part of our consideration. Maybe I'll turn it to John to talk about the cash flow pieces of this. Yeah.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nI think your question kind of summarized it, Tom. We would think of the cash flow as kind of the net of the two. That's generally you could think of that as almost your change in debt. So it's probably a good proxy for what we're. But I think to Ramy's point, it's what you're giving up in a stable environment, right?\nAnd so if the environment changes, that's where your economics can change. So equity markets over several years now have been on an upward trajectory. We've had higher interest rates. And it was really an opportunistic way for us to kind of lock in the exit value here and also find a really good partner that we've been able to work with, and get to know, and feel good about the transaction.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGotcha. Thanks.\nAnd then just my follow-up, can you comment on what your underwriting experience was like in MetLife Holdings this quarter between, let's say, on the mortality side for life insurance and then also on long-term care? Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nHey, Tom. It was very much in line this quarter across both the LTC book as well as the retail life book. So nothing to note here in terms of underwriting across MLH.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Rami.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBMW\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. First question was more high-level. Just hoping to get some thoughts on the current environment. To what extent is it influencing changes in how you're managing the company?\nI guess, for example, would you anticipate any changes to the capital management strategy or the expense strategy given the uncertainty in this environment, or do you view things largely as business as usual for now?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning, Ryan. Thanks for the question. It's Michelle. So clearly, we're not oblivious to the environment in which we operate. We've sort of, I think it's fair to say that the possibility of a recession has risen.\nHaving said that, I think our strategy, we like to call it all weather because, again, it doesn't assume a rosy picture. It does not assume a deep recession either. So I would say we're very much focused on executing on the pillars of the strategy. So no change whatsoever when it comes to that.\nI think you can see from sort of our capital management action that, again, there's no change in terms of our approach. The 3 billion authorization, the 4.1% increase in income and dividends per share, again, sort of evidence in terms of the confidence that our board and we have in our financial standing. Given the environment, we tend to focus on those levers that we do control.\nExpenses is one of them. We want to continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives, but at the same time, there are discretionary aspects to expenses that I've asked the team to make sure that we're managing really, really well given the environment. But beyond that, I would say I don't like to use the term BAU, but I would say we're very much sticking to our strategy and really pleased also with the underlying momentum that we're seeing across our businesses.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBMW\n\nThank you. And then in group benefits, PFO growth, I think ex participating policies was towards the lower end of your target. Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing and also how you think that may progress as the year goes along?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good morning. So if you think about our 2% reported number here, there are two drivers driving that kind of headline number. The first and the larger impact, I would say, is the favorable mortality we saw from those participating contracts, which John talked about.\nIf you compare our life underwriting ratios year over year, we did see more than a 5-point drop in mortality this quarter from Q1 of 2023. Really great outcome from an underwriting perspective, especially in what is a seasonally high mortality quarter. As you know, Q1 does tend to be heavier.\nNow, the impact that has on our participating contracts, you get lower death claims, which result in lower premiums. So if you exclude that impact, the underlying PFO growth was about 4%. So you're talking about a 200 basis points growth that is masked in our headline number. The other driver for the quarter does relate to our January 1 rate actions that we took on our dental block.\nAs we discussed a few times over the last six months, we did see a faster-than-expected acceleration in dental utilization. As part of our underwriting discipline, we are very quick to take actions when we see the market and utilization numbers move. January 1 is the most significant renewal date for our dental business.\nSo these actions did have an impact on our persistency in the dental block, but we remained disciplined in the market, and we did get the rate increases that we required, and we walked away from some business that didn't meet our target margins. I would say, as you look forward, the dental rate actions are largely behind us at this point. And in fact, we're seeing the earnings benefits starting to come through our dental earnings.\nAnd as you think about the full year, both of these effects, the PAR impact as well as the dental impact, will moderate. So you should expect us, for a full-year reported basis, to be back in line with our guidance of 4% to 7%. And you'd want to add another 100 basis points or so if you want to look at the underlying numbers, which exclude the PAR contracts.\nThen the last thing I would say is, based on our really strong results this quarter, we're also expecting no change to our full-year outlook on earnings for the group business.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBMW\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the buyback. It was obviously very strong in the Q1 and in April, it was pretty modest. I get your comment about kind of catching up to lack of activity in the Q4. But was there anything in the month of April that was sort of precluding you from maybe leaning in a little bit? I don't know if this VA deal was big enough where you were blacked out, but anything going on with the timing there?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Suneet. Michelle here. No. I think sort of April was sort of in line with what we did, what we set out to do, I would say. So there wasn't any impact from any pending announcements or anything like that. As I mentioned, in Q1, we leaned in given the fact that in Q4, given some pending announcements there, we were precluded from potentially doing more than we did.\nBut clearly, as I said, you can expect a more measured pace from here. So don't use the $1.4 billion in the quarter as a quarterly run rate. And we'll continue to be opportunistic but deliberate as well when it comes to our activity here. What I would also reiterate is that nothing changes in how we think about capital. Our first priority is funding attractive organic growth.\nNext, we will look for strategic inorganic opportunities that are risk-adjusted hurdle rate clearing. I think PineBridge is a good example of that. Then if we have excess capital, we will return it deliberately over time as we've consistently done.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That's fine. That makes sense. Then I guess for Ramy, obviously, the PRT sales in Q1 were pretty strong. But in markets like this where interest rates are moving around, equity markets are swinging around, and maybe the funding status of pension plans are swinging around as well, does that do anything to kind of activity in the market one way or the other?\nJust want to get a sense of how we should think about if this environment persists, what PRT could look like as we move through the year. Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nThank you, Suneet. I mean, excessive market volatility does have an impact. I would say it's more of a timing impact in terms of from a plan sponsor perspective. It can be a distraction in terms of ensuring how they're kind of thinking about their ALM in the context of highly volatile markets. But having said that, if you think about the space that we play in, in the PRT space, the jumbo space, these are plan sponsors who've been on a de-risking journey for a number of years.\nAnd therefore, as part of that de-risking journey, they are far more hedged, if you will, from a liability-driven perspective, both in terms of their interest rate exposure of the assets versus the liabilities, and would be largely out of the kind of risky bucket of assets, equities, alternatives well before the point that they're ready to transact.\nSo that tells you the stability of the segment of PRT plan sponsor, of DB plan sponsors who would transact, well-hedged, and you wouldn't expect to see much change in their funding ratios. And therefore, we think there may be a temporary impact in terms of a distraction, if you will, but we don't see that having a real change in terms of the pipeline of the transactions that will come through.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThat makes sense. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. First question on variable investment income. I think you have guided for a bit more normal return in 2025 and a pretty decent result in the quarter.\nBut given the market volatility in April and some shelved IPOs in the wake of tariff announcements, are you expecting you can still come in at a more normal level for the year? And if you have any insight into Q2, that would be helpful.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nHey, Wes. Good morning. It's John. Yeah. So VII in this quarter, I mean, private equity, as we mentioned in our opening remarks, had a 1.6% return in the quarter. Just as a side note, we also saw over 600 million of distributions come through, so well in excess of actually the earnings we saw in the quarter. Again, I would say a function of our well-diversified sized portfolio in the private equity funds.\nWe also had real estate funds on average come in, and real estate-related funds come in around 2%. So lower than kind of the implied run rate from the guidance we gave, but above the Q4, which was in line with the range we gave a quarter ago. And to your point around the outlook, look, while these investments had tended to lag public equity markets, public equity markets did very well last year.\nWe saw, obviously, there's a number of factors why PE returns were lagged there. But the current environment creates some challenge in an already difficult-to-project PE, probably more challenging to predict in the current environment. So one of the things I mentioned in my opening remarks is that in light of this uncertainty, we plan to actually provide some preliminary information in early July on the VII, and we should have decent insight.\nSo just again, in light of the kind of, I'd say, the unusual situation that we have, we'll look to do that as opposed to trying to forecast anything for now. So hopefully that helps.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYeah, it does. Thanks, John. And I guess my second question, I know I've asked a couple of times before, but as we're nearing implementation of the ESR in Japan, I think there were a couple of conversations with the industry and the regulator on some treatment of long-duration and FX-denominated products. Are you still feeling pretty good about implementation? Any thoughts on how that folds into your expected reinsurance strategy?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. I think you've asked it a few times. We'll probably give you the same answer we've given a few other times, which is still feeling pretty good. It's effective 1 April. Probably three things to think about. One is operational readiness.\nWe feel like we're in a good position. There are things that aren't perfect, but all in all, taking the collective weight of items, certainly one we can manage through, and we feel like we've made really good progress with the new framework. Other things to just remind you, we've always kind of priced under an economic framework in the past. So moving to this, it really doesn't change how we would operate.\nWe always had a view of economic and kind of the statutory framework. So that was always under our mentality, making sure good ALM always matched in terms of rates and currency in terms of our products. And then I think we'll, as we look at it now, there's certainly nothing that would indicate that it would change our dividend policy or factor as it relates to Japan.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Wilma Burdis with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. We just worked on an analysis of portfolio yield, and what we found is that NIM provides a very attractive risk-adjusted return. Could you just talk about how you market NIM and what the organic growth pipeline looks like there?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThanks. Hi, Wilma. Thanks for that. You can feel free to share that analysis. We'd like to see it too. But yeah, look, I think from a philosophy perspective, we certainly feel the same, and certainly as it relates to the clients that we look to serve. And look, I think pipeline continues to be good. Coming out, obviously, there's a variety of different factors over the last different few years, but there's been a steady growth in the client segments that we serve. And we see that continuing.\nI think to your point, I think the quality of our products and solutions that we offer, we believe, is differentiated and certainly provide what we believe is a great long-term value for our clients and our partners. So as of now, I'd say things continue. There's a lot of activity out there. There's a lot of opportunities from a business development perspective, and we're very optimistic of our five-year strategy here. So hopefully that helps.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance, Raymond James\n\nGreat. And could you just talk about the type of assets that you're managing for Talcott? Thank you.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nYeah. We don't get into too much details, but I'll give you generally, there's $6 billion of assets that we were able to kind of obtain through an investment management mandate. Half of it is a function of some of the assets that are part of this transaction. Another half was actually separate.\nBut as we obviously got to know and built a relationship with Talcott over time and also being able to share some of our capabilities, we're able to kind of work with them and provide an additional mandate on top of that. Mostly, I'll just say in some of the public fixed income area, but also some of those were overseas. So maybe that helps.\n\nWilma Burdis\n\nDirector of Asset Management and Life Insurance, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joel Hurwitz with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nEquity Research of Life Insurance and Retirement, Dowling & Partners\n\nHey, good morning. Can you unpack the non-medical health loss experience in the quarter? I get the seasonality, but was surprised to see it up a bit year over year. And I guess, how has dental experience this quarter versus last year period?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nSure. It's Ramy here. So maybe let me start with the dental piece.\nSo the performance of the dental business in this quarter was right in line with our expectations. Recall that Q1 just tends to be a higher utilization quarter as the benefit resets. Then I'll also just point you to what I just mentioned earlier with respect to the disciplined underwriting here in terms of the actions that we've been taking on 1/1. We're certainly pleased with the outcome of those actions.\nThat will set us up nicely in combination with the heavy Q1 utilization quarter behind us to see a gradual decline for the non-medical health ratio. Think of that for the full year being towards the midpoint of our range. The other parts of the ratio, disability, disability continues to perform very much in line with our expectations. STD and LTD incidents came in right on the mark.\nWe continue to see very strong recoveries in terms of the closures. I would say those are coming in slightly ahead of our expectations in the disability block. And the small headwind we did see in disability relates to delays in the Social Security Administration approvals, which did have somewhat of an impact this quarter, albeit small. So net, net, I would say performing in line with our expectations and think of a full year number to be close to the midpoint of our range.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nEquity Research of Life Insurance and Retirement, Dowling & Partners\n\nGot it. Very helpful. And then switching gears, other Asia sales were very strong in the quarter. Can you just unpack what you saw there? And then I guess with the increased geopolitical tensions, what are you seeing in April as far?\n\nLyndon Oliver",
    "content2": "Regional President in Asia, MetLife\n\nHey, Joel, it's Lyndon here. Yeah. So let me give you color on kind of the overall sales in Asia, and we'll cover what happens in Japan as well as what's going on in the rest of Asia. We've had a strong start to the year. Q1 sales were up 10% across the region, and we're on track to grow full year sales in line with our outlook of mid to high single digits. So let's start with Japan.\nWe've had a good, strong start. We've got strong market share across all our distribution channels, including the banker channel. And while we've seen some decline in the FX products in recent quarters, we are seeing momentum pick up. If you look at the sequential growth in Q1, it was strong.\nNow, looking at April, Michelle mentioned we'd launched a new single premium life product in the bank channel. This has been very well received, and we've got other actions planned during the rest of the year.\nSo we expect this momentum to continue. Now, going to the rest of Asia, outstanding quarter sales were up 41% from the prior year. And this is driven primarily by China, where we saw the addition of some new bank partners come on board, and that really helped with the sales there. And also in Korea, very strong performance in our face-to-face channels, both in career agency as well as in the independent channels. So I hope that helps.\n\nJoel Hurwitz\n\nEquity Research of Life Insurance and Retirement, Dowling & Partners\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one more question, and that question comes from Nick Anito with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Anito\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to touch on group life and the expectation for the balance of the year, given it's been coming in pretty strong.\nIs it something you have confidence in for a sustained period, or is it more touch and go for the outer quarters?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nEVP, CFO, and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife\n\nThanks. Thanks for the question. Just maybe to comment on this quarter first. So we did see favorable incidence, and really, you can draw almost a straight line between our results and the CDC population data results for the working-age population. And that favorability has been manifesting itself for the last kind of couple of quarters and working its way into our ratios.\nI would say at this point, I can't speculate, and I don't want to speculate if the favorability will continue for the rest of the year. It's too early to tell. But what may be useful is just to come back to our outlook guidance ratios. So remember, we guided to be at the midpoint of the lower half of our range.\nSo think of that as kind of an 85.5 number. And that guidance always assumes a heavier Q1 mortality. So with Q1 behind us and Q1 being favorable, just a simple arithmetic here, even if we continue not to see any further favorability, the simple arithmetic would have us towards the lower end of our range for the full year. So think about an 84 number for the full year compared to the guidance that we have given you before.\n\nNick Anito\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thanks. That's really helpful. Then I guess just on Chariot Re, can you guys give any update there? I think you previously said the expectation would be to do an initial backbook deal out of Met, but any update there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Nick. It's Michelle.\nSo really pleased with our progress, and we're excited about the growth opportunities that Chariot Re will allow us to capture. We're moving at pace with our co-sponsor, General Atlantic, to fully capitalize and operationalize the company. The intention here, I'll just reiterate, is to create a long-term partnership between MetLife and Chariot Re.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, Chariot Re will enhance our capital flexibility and efficiency and allow us to generate liability growth beyond our balance sheet capacity if need be. Again, our plans are sort of on track, I would say, in terms of expecting to launch around mid-year.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

Please wait. The conference will begin shortly.\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Q4 and FY 2024 earnings and outlook conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release, and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife Group\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Q4 2024 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release, and in our Quarterly Financial Supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer and Head of MetLife Investment Management. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife Group\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, MetLife reported Q4 and FY results that underscore the strength and resilience of our market-leading portfolio of businesses in the face of constant change. While unemployment in the US has stayed at low levels and economic growth appears healthy, the path and pace of anticipated interest rate cuts remain in question due to concerns about persistent inflation. MetLife's capacity to execute across changing environments has been a hallmark of our success. This past year, 2024, brought to a close the five-year period associated with our Next Horizon strategy. Despite a global pandemic, a short-lived banking crisis, and volatile interest rates, we delivered on all our Next Horizon financial commitments: return on equity, free cash flow, and operating leverage. The market has recognized our strong fundamental performance, as MetLife's stock outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index in 2024.\nMetLife did not go quietly into the end of the year, and we do not rest on our laurels. In December, we hosted a well-received Investor Day to roll out our New Frontier strategy, along with a refreshed set of financial commitments. While the basic tenets of Next Horizon, focus, simplify, and differentiate, aren't going anywhere, MetLife is at a different place than it was five years ago. We are more front-footed and more able to play offense. Our New Frontier strategy is more oriented towards growth, and by that, I mean responsible growth. To build on this, we have identified four strategic priorities as part of New Frontier. Together, they drive nearly 80% of adjusted earnings today and will fuel strong growth through the five-year New Frontier strategy. The first is further extending our leadership and Group Benefits. The second is capitalizing on our unique retirement platform.\nThe third is accelerating growth in asset management, while the fourth is expanding in high-growth international markets. Again, here at MetLife, we do not stand still. Along with the rollout of our New Frontier strategy, we announced several important transactions that activate across our new strategic priorities and which we believe will drive shareholder value for years to come. In December, MetLife and General Atlantic announced the formation of Chariot We, which will be a Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance company. We anticipate a combined equity investment of over $1 billion, and that Chubb will join us as an anchor investor. Chariot We will serve the growing demand for life and retirement solutions around the world. The strategic use of reinsurance allows us to position MetLife to capture the growth in these trends and add to enterprise value.\nRe will also leverage MetLife's deep insurance and investing expertise, as well as the investment capabilities of General Atlantic. Also, in December, we announced an agreement to acquire PineBridge Investments, a leading global asset manager with approximately $100 billion in assets under management. PineBridge will substantially add to MetLife Investment Management by expanding its public and private credit offerings, especially on an international basis. Finally, MIM signed an agreement to acquire the high-yield and bank loan, the strategic fixed income, and the small-cap equity teams from Mesirow Financial, with about $6 billion of assets managed by those teams. Our New Frontier strategy is more than just words on a page. To measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable, we have established new five-year commitments. We have introduced adjusted earnings per share as a new metric for MetLife.\nWe are committed to achieving double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the course of the New Frontier period, with 60% driven by business and margin growth, and the balance from disciplined capital management. We have increased our adjusted return on equity target range to 15% to 17%, up from our previous target range of 13% to 15%. We have also committed to cut another 100 bps from our prior direct expense ratio target of 12.3% during the five-year period. Finally, we have committed to $25 billion of free cash flow over the five-year period, up from our prior five-year $20 billion commitment. You'll see when John discusses our 2025 outlook; these commitments are in alignment with our expectation for the near term. Now, turning to our Q4 2024 results. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $2.09 per share, up 14% from the prior year period.\nExcluding notable items in both periods, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, up 8%. Variable Investment Income, or VII, was higher in the quarter due to improved private equity fund performance, and we saw good momentum across most of our businesses. Shifting to the full year 2024, we generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.8 billion. Strong volume growth and favorable underwriting, along with market factors, helped drive our results. Pointing to our capital efficiency, MetLife posted an adjusted ROE of 15.2% for the year, above our target range, and our direct expense ratio was 12.1%, beating our Next Horizon target range. Our Group Benefits business continues to demonstrate its leadership position in what I believe to be the most attractive segment of U.S. life insurance. Group Benefits generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $1.7 billion in 2024.\nFull-year sales were up 8% on strong growth in national accounts. This is a business where we believe that scale, technology, and discipline will carry the day. We believe MetLife has the capacity to continue to grow faster than the market, driven by the many scale benefits associated with our size. In the New Frontier, our formula for Group Benefits growth is simple: more employers, more products, and more employee participation, and we are actively driving each of these elements. Moving to retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding notables, totaled $1.6 billion in the year. RIS continued to demonstrate the strength and breadth of its liability generation capabilities in 2024. Our liability exposures grew 3.4% in the year, above the midpoint of our prior outlook range, with strong contributions from structured settlements, U.K. longevity and funded reinsurance, and U.S. pension risk transfer.\nShifting to our international businesses, Asia posted adjusted earnings, excluding notables, of $1.7 billion in 2024, up 21% on the rebound in VII. General Account AUM grew 5% on a constant currency basis. It was also a historic year for our Latin America business, which saw record adjusted earnings, excluding notables, of $877 million, despite substantial currency headwinds. Our expanded product portfolio in the region and our investments in digital distribution place us in the pole position to further grow in this important region. When I look across our business results for the year, what stands out is the balance of our adjusted earnings across segments. Our three largest segments, Group Benefits, RIS, and Asia, all posted adjusted earnings in the neighborhood of $1.7 billion.\nI have framed MetLife's balance and diversification as being our superpower, something that has enabled us to generate the type of all-weather performance achieved in 2024. Moving to capital management, in the Q4, our buyback activity was restricted due to pending announcements. In total, we still repurchased nearly $400 million of our common stock in the Q4. We have started the new year strong, having repurchased roughly $470 million of our common stock in January. For the full year 2024, we returned approximately $4.7 billion to shareholders through $3.2 billion of our common stock repurchases and $1.5 billion of common stock dividends. In closing, 2024 marks the end of Next Horizon and the beginning of New Frontier, where we are starting from a position of strength and with a greater emphasis on responsible growth.\nMetLife operates in highly attractive markets with deep competitive moats that we've constructed carefully over time, and we are poised to capitalize on the many global tailwinds which have informed our New Frontier strategy. MetLife is well-positioned to deliver strong, responsible growth, attractive returns, and with lower risk. Not one or the other, but all three. That is MetLife's unique value proposition. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in greater detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the Q4 2024 supplemental slides, which cover highlights of our financial performance, including an update on our liquidity and capital position. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q4 and full year of 2024. Net income was $1.2 billion and $4.2 billion for the Q4 and full year of 2024, respectively. The difference between net income and adjusted earnings is attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to the rise in long-term interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by Market Risk-Benefit, or MRB, remeasurement gains due to higher interest rates.\nIn addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment, and credit remained stable. As highlighted on the bottom of the page, we had two notable items in the current quarter that net to a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $10 million. This was primarily due to interest associated with a tax refund, partially offset by higher asbestos litigation reserves in the quarter. On page four, we provide a year-over-year comparison of Q4 adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, were $1.4 billion, up 1%, and 3% on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher Variable Investment Income and solid volume growth, which were partially offset by less favorable recurring interest and expense margins compared to the previous year.\nAdjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items, were $2.08, up 8% and 10% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $416 million, down 11% from the prior year quarter. The key driver was less favorable Non-Medical Health underwriting margins compared to the prior year. The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 71.8%; although above prior year, it was in line with expectations and within our annual target range of 69% to 74%. The group life mortality ratio was 83.2% for the quarter. For the full year, the ratio was 84.5% at the bottom end of our 2024 target range of 84% to 89%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full-year basis were up 4% year-over-year, taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 bps.\nThe underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. RIS adjusted earnings were $386 million in Q4 of 2024, down 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher Variable Investment Income. Solid volume growth also contributed to the year-over-year results. RIS total investment spreads were 112 bps in the Q4, up 6 bps sequentially, mainly due to higher Variable Investment Income, as our core spread remained flat at 108 bps, consistent with expectations. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 26%, primarily driven by growth across several products, most notably PRT, including U.K.-funded reinsurance. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we completed our inaugural funded reinsurance transaction for approximately $300 million, demonstrating the successful relationships that we have built with leading U.K. insurers.\nThis brings our total PRT inflows for both the U.S. and U.K. combined to approximately $6.7 billion for 2024. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $443 million, up 50% and 52% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher Variable Investment Income and favorable underwriting margins, which included positive reserve refinements that benefited adjusted earnings by roughly $30 million. For Asia's full year 2024 key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis versus 2023. Lower Japan sales were partially offset by other Asia markets, which were up 21%, most notably due to solid growth in Korea, India, and China. In Japan, sales were down 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products.\nLatin America adjusted earnings were $201 million, down 3% but up 10% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher volume growth across the region, partially offset by lower Chilean and Encaje returns versus a strong Q4 2023. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, although reported growth rates are being masked by recent currency headwinds. Adjusted PFOs were down 3% but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $59 million, up 26% and 31% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth and lower tax charges in the quarter. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins and underwriting margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 10% and 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales across the region.\nMetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 2%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023. Favorable life underwriting was a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $209 million versus an adjusted loss of $156 million in the prior year. Higher expenses and taxes were partially offset by higher Variable Investment Income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23.5%, modestly below our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax Variable Investment Income for the four quarters and full year of 2024. Variable Investment Income was $293 million in Q4, driven by the private equity portfolio, which had an average return of 1.8% in the quarter. Our real estate and other funds had an average return of essentially zero in the quarter.\nAs a reminder, PE, real estate, and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. For the full year, Variable Investment Income, or VII, was $1 billion, below our 2024 target of approximately $1.5 billion, but well ahead of the prior year. Real estate and other funds accounted for most of the shortfall, while PE returns were largely in line with our annual 2024 expected returns. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment and Corporate and other for the four quarters and full year 2024. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long-dated liability profiles. However, as a reminder, each business has its own discrete portfolio aligned and matched to its liabilities. Asia's VII portfolio outperformed in the quarter, generating more than 50% of the total.\nTurning to page seven, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over eight quarters and full year 2023 and 2024. Our direct expense ratio in Q4 of 2024 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and Group Benefits, as well as higher employer-related costs and technology initiatives. That said, as we've highlighted previously, we believe our full-year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2024, our direct expense ratio was 12.1%, below our 2024 target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page eight. Overall, MetLife is well-capitalized with more than ample liquidity.\nWe had share repurchases of roughly $400 million in Q4 and have repurchased shares totaling $470 million in January. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, preliminary 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $2.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by impacts of the reinsurance transaction in November of 2023 and lower net investment income partially offset by favorable underwriting. On page nine, this chart shows the final tally in beating our five-year financial commitments under Next Horizon. Our full year 2024 adjusted ROE of 15.2% was above our original 12% to 14% commitment made in 2019 and above our 13% to 15% guidance for 2024.\nFor the years 2020 through 2024, we generated distributable cash of $20.7 billion, above our $20 billion commitment, and created $1.2 billion of additional operating leverage capacity to accelerate growth above our $1 billion commitment. Now let's turn to page 11 for further details on our near-term outlook, starting with the overview. Based on the forward currency curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to further strengthen, which creates a headwind to adjusted earnings growth of approximately $150 million to $175 million in 2025. This impact is embedded in the non-US segment outlooks that I will discuss in a moment. The forward interest rate curve projects long-term interest rates to be stable and the yield curve to steepen, a positive development, and we use an assumption of 5% annual return for the S&P 500.\nFor our near-term targets, these are consistent with our New Frontier commitments that we announced at Investor Day. We expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We expect adjusted ROE to be in the range of 15% to 17%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, which supports our five-year commitment to generate $25 billion plus of free cash flow. Also, given our continued focus on expense discipline, we target reducing our expense ratio down 100 bps to 11.3% by 2029. Therefore, for 2025, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance to 12.1%, down from 12.3% in 2024. Specifically, for 2025, Variable Investment Income is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion pre-tax.\nOur Corporate and other adjusted loss is expected to be between $850 million to $950 million after tax, and we're maintaining our expected effective tax rate range of 24% to 26%. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. Further sensitivities are in the appendix to these slides. On page 12, the chart reflects our expectation of VII average asset balances to be stable in 2025. We are increasing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be between 9% to 11%, and we are also increasing our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in a range of 7% to 9% over the near term.\nIn 2025, we expect both PE and real estate and other funds to be toward the lower end of their respective ranges before trending higher in 2026 and 2027. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on page 13. For Group Benefits, we are increasing our adjusted PFO growth target to 4% to 7% annually over the near term. We are maintaining our near-term underwriting guidance ranges, group life mortality ratio of 84% to 89%, and group Non-Medical Health\nHowever, for Group Benefits, if the positive trend we have seen in the last couple of quarters persists into the first half of the year, we expect the full-year ratio to be in the bottom half of the guidance range in 2025. Lastly, we expect Group Benefits adjusted earnings to benefit from factors outside of underwriting, largely from continued change in our product mix, greater operating efficiencies, and higher investment income. This will add an increment of 5% to 10% to adjusted earnings in 2025. For RIS, we've talked about the business being comprised primarily of spread and fee earnings. To that end, we provide a long-term balance growth range for total liabilities, which can be used to project our future spread and fee balances. In light of the opportunity we see under New Frontier, we are now increasing our total liability annual growth guidance to 3% to 5%.\nThe total spread guidance range for the upcoming year can be applied to our projected general account balances to get a good proxy for our pre-tax spread income before expenses. We expect 2025 total general account investment spread to be 110 bps to 135 bps, assuming the forward curve holds and based on our VII estimate for 2025. We anticipate our core spread to stabilize from 2025 forward now that all remaining interest rate caps have matured. Beyond spread earnings, total fee and underwriting income, net of expenses, adds an incremental 5% to RIS adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline approximately 4% to 6% in 2025, and we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $650 million to $800 million in 2025.\nThe business run-up accelerated in 2024 to roughly 9% of adjusted earnings as life and variable annuity lapses were higher during the year. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our segments outside the U.S. on page 14. For Asia, we expect sales to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM on a constant currency basis to maintain mid-single digit growth. Asia adjusted earnings in 2025 are expected to grow mid-single digits on a constant currency basis and low single digits on a reported basis, given the yen weakness assumed in the forward curve. For 2026 and 2027, adjusted earnings are expected to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and constant currency basis.\nFor Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings in 2025 to grow high single digits on a constant currency basis and flat on a reported basis, given the forward currency rates, which assumes Mexican and Chilean pesos weaken in 2025. For 2026 and 2027, we expect adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow high single digits on both a reported and constant currency basis. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a reported basis. For adjusted earnings, we expect EMEA's new quarterly run rate to be $70 million to $75 million in 2025 and then grow mid-single digits in 2026 and 2027. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. Our fourth quarter and full-year results reflected the strong underlying fundamentals across our portfolio of businesses.\nWe continue to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation, and a diversified set of market-leading businesses. As we complete the final leg of our Next Horizon journey, we are pleased to have exceeded all the commitments that we made. Now, as we forge our way into the New Frontier, our strategic priorities position us well to deliver on our unique value proposition of accelerating responsible growth and generating attractive returns with lower risk. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again.\nIf you have called upon to ask your question and are listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Again, press star one to join the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. My first question was for Ramy Tadros on group. Can you give some additional details and color on Q1 renewals, what you saw in terms of competition, pricing, and any other factors you'd highlight?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nSure, Ryan. Good morning. So I would say we're off to a really good start in Q1. We've had renewals and persistency within our kind of expectations.\nWe're particularly pleased with the renewal actions on the Dental business, which we've talked about before in terms of getting our targeted rate actions as well as maintaining very strong persistency. So off to a really strong start in Q1. And that's part of the reason why we really also feel good about taking our PFO guidance range from 4% to 7%, which is a one-point increase from where we were last year.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks. And then a question on the, I guess, somewhat broader question on the PRT market. There were a number of lawsuits targeted against one specific provider and plan sponsors that shows them it's gotten expanded to a couple more.\nMetLife has not been involved at this point, but I guess just curious, are you starting to see any level of lean in that market as plan sponsors might be more concerned about this lawsuit activity, or is it not really having much of an impact for you guys at this point?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nHey, Ryan, it's Ramy here again. Look, it's very hard to forecast what and if any impact this is going to have on the market. What may be helpful is just to share with you what we're seeing as of now, right? So one, this is a very well-established market. It does operate within the rules and regulations which govern plan sponsors' responsibilities and a very robust solvency regulation which govern insurance companies. And within that context, the PRT products offer a really valuable solution to plan sponsors and retirees.\nSo in the here and now, we finished last year with $6.4 billion of inflows for PRTs and healthy ROEs, and we're off to a really good start in 2025. We had a $640 million plan that we wrote in the first part of 2025. The factors that we talked about that will continue to drive this market in terms of the funded status, the financial, and the industrial logic will persist. This is also reflective of the pipeline. So we still see a pipeline. We still see interest here, and we haven't really seen any material impact on the market.\nJust to step back outside of PRT and think about our RIS liability origination in general, inclusive of all the pieces we talked about on our Investor Day today, as well as the adjacencies that we talked about, we still feel really good that we will deliver that 3% to 5% balanced growth over the near term, which is also a point up from where we were last year. In aggregate, we still feel really good about that range sitting here today.\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. First question for Ramy as well. Some peers have called out elevated voluntary benefit loss ratios this quarter. Did you also see that?\nWhen I consider that impact, plus the benefits you expect to get from Dental repricing, would you say Non-Medical Health\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nHey, good morning, Tom. I would say for Accident & Health, we aren't seeing any material deviations outside of what you would call normal range of expectations. And we look at this on a product-by-product basis. Remember, it's not one single product. So I wouldn't say we've seen any material deviations here, and we continue to see very robust growth here with really solid margins. If you think about next year versus this year, we did finish 2024 about less than a point above the midpoint of our range. We haven't changed the range for next year.\nSo a good starting point for 2025 is to go back to the midpoint of that range on the Non-Medical Health\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGotcha. So like a point better is a reasonable base case.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nMidpoint of the range is where we point to. So I think that's where I would start. Yeah.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood. And just for a follow-up, John, just on raising alternative return assumptions for 2025, what's the thought process there? Is it just general market performance? Do you have some line of visibility into Q1? Because obviously, you haven't met any of the lower quarterly expectations for 2024. So curious why raise it now.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah. Good morning, Tom. Yeah. So there's two components there in VII. We have our private equity LP investments, and then we have some real estate and other funds.\nSo I think on the, and the private equity, obviously, is a much bigger proportion, as you saw on the slide, in terms of average assets. We have a few things going on. Obviously, there's been a tailwind with public equity markets. That has been the case. It hasn't really shown itself in the private markets yet, but we think that that is still beneficial. Our sense is that the underlying operating companies are benefiting from that. You're starting to sense an increase in exit activity beginning. So the backlog is starting to remove or get better. I think there's probably a more accommodating regulatory and business-friendly environment ahead of us. So I think there's a number of positive backdrops that lead you to kind of our view for private equity. The private equity returns for the year, they actually weren't far off.\nIf not, they might have been actually on target relative to the guidance we gave last year. So we're really just kind of moving it up a point. So that takes the big, I'll say the majority of the VII balance. Then you're left with real estate and other. And that asset class probably underperformed our expectation last year. But we're starting to see, and you're hearing, there's some bit of optimism beginning in the real estate market. It's showing signs of stabilizing. And so our view is that we're going to start to see recovery in values in 2025. So the combined factors there give us a view that next year will be better than this year. We still think that there'll be a gradual improvement throughout the year.\nSo we don't think you get in the first quarter to call it the run rate or divide 1.7/4. We think it's still lower, but we think we're above where we were here in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of our thinking.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat does. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks. I wanted to go to the RIS spread guidance. If I look at the 110 to 135, it looks like, excuse me, that might be 5 bps below what you originally guided to for 2024. But you've taken your VII up, and I thought you said core spreads were supposed to be stable. So I'm just trying to understand what would explain that delta, if I'm remembering correctly.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nHey. Good morning, Suneet. It's John.\nSo let me give you my maybe way of thinking about it, and I'll come back to your specific question of the relative to the last year's guidance. So we ended this fourth quarter at 112, which was up 6 bps sequentially. We were flat on the core spread at 108. And then as we look ahead, our view is that we expect 2025 total spread to be, as we said, 110 to 135. If you take the midpoint of that, it's actually above the 2024 actual spread that we ended with, right? So what's to do in that? So you see a bit of recovery in VII being forecasted, coupled with stabilizing core spreads in 2025. So all of the interest rate caps have rolled off. That is one of the things that started to depress core spreads during the course of 2024.\nThose hedges performed as intended, which was to protect us from a sharp rise of interest rates and an inverted curve. So now we think of core spread stabilizing into 2025, and quite honestly, for the near term. We typically are pretty hesitant about talking about more than one year, but I think we're starting to see, I think, steepening the curve will be positive eventually. It could have a little pressure on us in the near term as we reposition some of the portfolio, but it also gives us the ability to implement other tools that we have. So maybe there's a few points of one or two-point pressure in 2025 relative to the 108, but we think quickly kind of reverts back to that. So you think of the 106 to 108 over the near term is a pretty good sense of what our core spread.\nYou're going to see a lot more stability in the spread as we go forward. And especially as we put on new business, they tend to be accretive now to spread as well. So again, I think it's a very positive backdrop, but that maybe helps try to reconcile. I think relative to last year, I think the biggest probably delta is just the roll-off of the interest rate caps relative to this year.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That makes sense. Excuse me. And then on Chariot, can you just talk about what sort of blocks of business you'd be interested in using that vehicle for? Is it PRT? Is it sort of retail annuities? Can you use it domestically and internationally? Just some color about the scope of what you're thinking there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife Group\n\nSure. Good morning, Suneet. It's Michel.\nSo just taking a step back, let me just say we're very pleased with the progress we're making here and really excited about the growth opportunities that Chariot We will allow us to capture. Keep in mind, we've been at work on this with our partner, General Atlantic, for less than a year. So we're continuing to move at pace to fully capitalize and operationalize the company. Again, the intention here is to create a long-term strategic partnership with Chariot Re. As we mentioned at Investor Day, really, this is intended to enhance our capital flexibility and to allow us to generate additional liability growth beyond our balance sheet capacity if need be. The other aspect to this is that it will allow us to convert this additional growth into high-value earnings for MIM as well.\nI think we said also that the intention here is that for the first few years, the liabilities will be sourced through MetLife. But the possibility does exist that down the road, Chariot We may reinsure liabilities from third parties as well. And the liabilities sourced through MetLife include sort of PRT and other liabilities sourced by RIS, as well as potentially Japan liabilities. So hopefully, this gives you a bit of color.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. First one I had for you is actually on MetLife Investment Management. I'm sure you saw there was a news article suggesting that maybe Brighthouse Financial would potentially look to sell itself.\nAnd I'm not asking you to opine on that, but what I'm more interested in is if you could frame for us what kind of impact you could potentially have in MetLife Investment Management if an asset manager, one of these private equity-backed companies, engaged there and were interested in managing General Account. How would that affect potentially your positioning? How much money do you make off their General Account management, etc.?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nHey, Alex. Good morning. It's John. I think first thing is we don't comment on specific client P&Ls. So you probably won't get that out of me today. But look, they're an excellent customer and client of ours. We take pride in the fact that we have them as a customer, and particularly given our historical relationship and the historical and personal relationships we all have.\nI think it's a prized client for us, and we really value it. We've read the papers as well and heard that as well. And so look, we've had other situations over time occur. We think we offer a unique value proposition and provide some unique capabilities. That's what we've been building here in MetLife Investment Management, and we continue to do that. We're looking to grow our capabilities, and you saw that most recently in some of the announcements that we made. So we think we have a unique offering. Having said that, we recognize that things can change over time, and we think we're a well-diversified client base. And we'll have to manage things as they come, but we are pretty excited about the things that we have to offer.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Totally understand. Second one, maybe on capital deployment, free cash in a really strong spot.\nWould be interested too, though, if you could comment at all about how much capital is behind, statutory capital is behind the holdings business at this point, and how to think about if you did find opportunities there, how that could add to the capital flexibility you have. And then ultimately, are there areas that you'll look to add to in terms of inorganic activity?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah. Hey, Alex. It's John. It's probably a little bit of a too broad of a question for us to answer. I think as we've talked about, we are very effective at managing MetLife Holdings. At the same time, we have a third-party view and talk to third parties to see if there's an opportunity for kind of something that makes sense that's accretive to our firm from a risk-adjusted basis.\nThere's a lot of different variables and factors that go into the outcomes or the items that drive value creation. So it's probably a little hard to kind of give that broad answer. Also, there's diversification benefits we have to consider, as well, and things like that. So at the end of the day, it's been performing very well for us. When we think there's an opportunity, you've seen us take action. If not, there's no burning platform for us, and we're happy to manage this effectively ourselves. We think we have the unique capabilities to do that.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nWesley Carmichael\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the last question and maybe a little bit less broad, but particularly on Long-Term Care.\nHaven't gotten a lot of attention lately, but I think last quarter you made some comments on the risk transfer market that seemed somewhat constructive. I'm just curious if there's any further developments there in terms of pricing or bid-asking. Just maybe if I think about that block in particular, how does Long-Term Care kind of flow into the free cash flow conversion ratio for the company? Because I know a lot of the runoff in holdings has a pretty high cash flow profile.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nHey, good morning. It's Ramy here. Look, like we talked about last quarter, we are seeing more activity in that risk transfer market. When deals get announced, it means you're getting more convergence between cedents and reinsurers. That's encouraging. Having said that, these are always complex transactions to execute. They take time.\nOur objective for any risk transfer deal is always the same. We want to maximize shareholder value and continue to serve our customers. And from the former, price matters for these deals, and so does structure. But in the interim specific to our book, I would say it's well-capitalized, well-reserved. Recall we are under the New York DFS reserving standards. We're held to a higher bar here. The book is well-managed. It's performing in line with our expectations. And we continue to have a really successful rate action program that's allowing us to kind of obtain the necessary premium increases and continuing to provide coverage. So that's kind of a bit of an update in terms of where we stand. And I'll let John talk about the free cash flow piece of it.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah, sure. It is a block of business that is growing its liabilities over time still.\nSo it has not reached peak. So at the end of the day, it's actually not providing much in the way of cash flow these days. If anything, it continues to strain it, just given you have to grow your continuing to grow liabilities to the peak. So hopefully that helps.\n\nWesley Carmichael\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nNo, no. Thank you. Thank you very much. My second question was just on the positive trends in Group Life that you mentioned that may persist through 2025. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing recently? And could this be something that persists a little bit longer term?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident, MetLife Group\n\nHey, good morning. It's Ramy here. Look, if you look at the public data and the recent trends in the CDC population data, in particular for the working-age population, you see favorability in that data year over year.\nGiven our size and diversification, that favorability in the population data is working its way into our ratios here. And that's probably the major driver as to why we came below the lower end of our kind of range for 2024. We're still watching it. I think I would say if the positive trends that we have seen in terms of population mortality continue and continue into say the first half of 2025, we would expect that for the full year, we would be in the bottom half of our guidance range on the mortality ratio, as John alluded to. So very much population data-driven and that favorability working into our numbers.\n\nWesley Carmichael\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. I just had a couple of questions. The first one is on commercial real estate.\nIf we look at your portfolio, your metrics are fairly stable, although they've been getting slightly worse over the last few quarters, both on the coverage ratio and on loan-to-value, but not materially. How should we think about losses coming in from that over the course of this year? And has the market stabilized, or do you think there's more pain to go through as you go through this year? And then secondly, on pension reform in Latin America, there's been a lot of concern about the Chilean market, and it comes and goes. But I think recently there have been even some reports about potential nationalization of some of the AFP businesses. So just wondering if you have any insights on what is going on there.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah, thanks, Jimmy. It's John. Good morning.\nOn the commercial mortgage front in the market, as we all know, there's been some recent pressure over the last few years. But I think the backdrop is starting to build some kind of optimism for the going forward. Obviously, there's been strong economic growth that continues to remain healthy. You started to see even some real estate fundamentals beginning. Even in Office, it's showing signs of bottoming. It's still probably not quite there yet, but it's showing signs. Office vacancies likely peaked in 2024. You see the remote work starting to reverse. You see lease signings have been increasing. And so all in all, and then you couple that with a low construction pipeline. All of that starts to give itself the ability to start to make a shift in terms of where things are.\nI think even vacancy rates across other properties are at historical averages, if not below. Then last thing I'd highlight is you're beginning to see signs of transaction volumes pick up. Even us, I think we had an $80 million level of or $90 million of gains this quarter on sales. So you're starting to see transactions moving. So look, as we look forward, we think we're approaching the peak of the cycle or trough, whichever way you want to put it. And so we think from an LTV perspective, we probably have hit our point. Maybe there's a little more change, but I think we've kind of hit it in terms of LTVs. And looking forward, in terms of losses, I would say we've effectively reserved for the most part, if not all, for losses.\nSo right now, it's just kind of getting to the end of letting the dust settle. Probably the best way to think about what's left is we might have a point or two of RBC. That's maybe a better way to kind of size what this means as opposed to maybe charge-offs or losses because we probably have been fully reserved now. And all else equal, obviously. And so once all the dust settles, maybe there's another point or two on average in terms of the impact of the cycle. That's how I'd maybe put it. I'll turn to Eric.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYep. Hi, Jimmy. And regarding the Chile pension reform, so yeah, you're right. After almost a decade of debate, a pension reform was approved last week by the Chilean Congress. So now with this recent development, basically, we have more clarity on what's next.\nAnd in a nutshell, the key takeaways from this reform are threefold. One, the private pension system continues in its current structure with a few adjustments. The second is that employer contributions will be gradually increased over time. And the third is in terms of implementation, the reform will be gradual and take several years. So some elements of the law will require us to adapt our operations over time. And we don't foresee any material impact to our business that we wouldn't be able to mitigate. And we continue to remain very much committed to providing high-quality pension management services to our customers as we navigate these changes over time.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nDue to time constraints, our last question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on MIM. I know that's included within Corporate.\nAnd John, I know in December you told us you guys would start breaking it out right this year. So could you give us a sense of how much earnings MIM contributed in 2024 and the growth that you're expecting in MIM in 2025 within your guide?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah. Good morning, Elyse. Look, we'll do all that when we start to break out the segment. And the reason why I hesitate to start doing that now is what we tried to do today is provide you the outlook based on our current state. And as you just said, MIM's incorporated in that. But it's spread out. So I'm reluctant to kind of throw out a number that then creates other confusion. So I think for modeling purposes, I would stick to kind of the segmentation that we have today.\nAs we said at Investor Day, we expect to report MIM as a segment in 2025. But in light of the recent announcement of PineBridge, we are now aiming to do that to coincide with the closing of the transaction. And you can all thank John Hall. He said that you worked very hard, all of you, and that we wanted to make it easier for you to do all your model changes. So you can thank him in due time. So we expect the timing of the close to be in the second half of 2025. We have a number of regulatory approvals that we have to get done, but the team is working intensely to get those completed. So that would be our timing of when we'd give more info on MIM.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd then one last quick one.\nIt sounds like you guys are using the forward curve, right, for some of the currency assumptions within the guide. I'm just trying to get a sense if there's upside or even downside risk to some of the international earnings as currency moves during 2025.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO and Head of MetLife Investment Management, MetLife Group\n\nYeah, that's correct, Elyse. We tend to just lock in on the Wed Dec 31 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (Philippine Standard Time) forward curves. I think the places where we're seeing the most change over the last three months is primarily Latin America. You saw that mostly throughout the Q4 happen. The average for the year is really kind of pressured there. I think from here, we see maybe a little more weakening from the spot rate. I think at the end of 2025, it's somewhere a little above 21, where we're maybe hovering in the 20s today. Then also Asia as well. We use a forward curve.\nI think the yen today is in the JPY 154 range or so, something like that. I think the forward curve says the spot rate will be in the low JPY 150s, somewhere around there. On average, there's a little pressure if you take the average for the year. It's a little bit of a headwind as well as some of the other Asian currencies. Hopefully that helps.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to John Hall for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife Group\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. Have a great day.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThis concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.\nPlease wait. The conference will begin shortly."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded before we get started. I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, all. We appreciate you joining MetLife's Q2 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also available to participate. We released our supplemental slides last night and they are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information for your review. Q&A will follow prepared remarks and will end just before the top of the hour.\nAs a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up now to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the Q2 results that we posted last night and believe the quarter clearly reflects MetLife's core strengths, including the momentum across our businesses and the greater predictability of our performance achieved through our consistent execution. The expectations we shared about our performance came to pass in the Q2, in line with our forecasts and, in some cases, even better after normal seasonal impacts in the Q1. The performance of our flagship Group Benefits franchise shone through in the Q2. Variable Investment Income, or VII, performed in line with the expectations we laid out in the Q1, with a recovery in private equity returns partially offset by the performance of real estate funds, which saw significantly narrower losses in the Q2.\nThe broad diversification of our businesses has proven to be a fundamental strength for MetLife, creating many natural offsets and allowing us to generate growth while navigating the tides of shifting business and economic dynamics, and our ability to generate strong recurring cash flow, coupled with our discipline to apply capital to its highest and best use, enables us to drive sustained long-term value for our shareholders. In Q2, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $2.28 per share, up 18% from the prior year period. The strong result was driven by favorable underwriting, good volume growth, and higher variable investment income led by the positive performance I just mentioned. In total, net income in Q2 was $912 million, substantially higher than $370 million in the prior year period.\nStrong adjusted earnings growth, aided by our unwavering focus on execution, generated outstanding results measured by several of our key performance metrics. MetLife posted a 17.3% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, well above our target range of 13% to 15 and a powerful example of our ability to efficiently deploy capital and generate profitable growth for our shareholders. MetLife's direct expense ratio in Q2 was 11.9%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. As we have noted before, the positive leverage in this ratio is not only a measure of our ability to control costs, but also our capacity to grow revenue at a faster rate than expenses in Q2. Both top line growth and lower direct expenses were contributors to our excellent quarterly expense ratio.\nWhen we established our Next Horizon strategy almost five years ago, it was supported by the interconnected foundational pillars of Focus, Simplify, and Differentiate. Our success in executing against our Focus pillar is evident in the high-teen internal rates of return we achieve on new business and our strong enterprise-wide return on equity. Similarly, our success in executing against our Simplify pillar manifests in our improving expense ratio. Our drive to execute against our Differentiate pillar is essentially funded by the success we've achieved through our Focus and Simplify pillars. When we activated Next Horizon, we committed to free up $1 billion of expense capacity to invest in growth initiatives and technology, and we have done so matching both sides of this equation.\nThis shows up in dozens of internal technology initiatives that are making it easier for customers to purchase our products as well as for them to receive their benefit and retirement payments. We see our capacity to invest in technology at MetLife scale as a true differentiator relative to our competitors, which we believe will only get more impactful over time. There are many tools in our toolbox that will help drive this advantage forward, including artificial intelligence or AI. From our standpoint, we believe MetLife's large pool of data puts us in an advantage position with AI having the potential to act as a force multiplier and further widen the divide in our favor. Yet this is not just future talk.\nAI has been part of our playbook at MetLife for years, and we are seeing many initiatives move to implementation to create seamless and personalized customer experiences, improve decision making, and empower employees to focus on purposeful work work. Be assured, we understand the power of AI commands great responsibility. With that in mind, we are at the vanguard of this topic and will be issuing our policy on the responsible use of AI in Q3. Shifting to our business segment results, our leading group benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $533 million, representing an all-time quarterly record. As group life mortality experience snapped back from the seasonally impacted Q1.\nGroup Life mortality registered a benefit ratio of 79.1% in Q2. For the year to date period, the Group Life benefit ratio is now firmly at the lower end of our annual target range of 84% to 89.\nOur growth strategy in the attractive Group Benefits space is twofold. On a national accounts basis, employers with greater than 5,000 employees, we are driving penetration across employer groups via new products and greater employee participation. On a regional accounts basis, employers with less than 5,000 employees, we are seeking to accelerate growth via a more refined distribution focus, a broader suite of products, and by attacking white space. The absence of any employer offered benefits across both avenues of growth, national and regional. Increasing enrollment and utilization of voluntary products are primary elements of boosting sales and margins. Moving to RIS, business momentum was evident in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment, which enjoyed several notable wins.\nThese included two jumbo pension risk transfer deals totaling $3.5 billion, a $2.2 billion stable value addition, as well as $3.3 billion of UK longevity reinsurance, underscoring the breadth of our liability origination in this segment. Beyond these wins, we continue to see strong flow for structured settlements where we are the market leader with more than $700 million sold in the Q2. In Asia, we enjoyed solid growth across a range of metrics. While sales in Japan have been impacted by currency fluctuations, assets under management in Asia continue to grow, rising 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Outside of Japan, sales were up 60% on the strength of a large group sale in Australia.\nLooking to Latin America, top line and bottom line results were strong again despite some currency headwinds. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues were up 12% on a constant currency basis, pointing to sustained business momentum in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings rose 10% year-over-year on strong volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. Adjusted PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis due to strong sales across the region. Our business in EMEA is an example of our efficiency mindset at work. We simplified the structure of our business and refocused it on protection products with strong free cash flow producing positive tangible results. Moving to Capital and Cash, MetLife is well capitalized and our capacity to generate strong recurring free cash flow allows us to meet our commitments and provides flexibility to proactively seize attractive growth opportunities.\nIn the absence of compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital to our shareholders. We were active on the capital management front in Q2 from both an equity and debt standpoint. We paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million, reflecting a 4.8% increase to our common stock dividend per share. We also bought back around $900 million of our common shares in Q2 and repurchased about another $270 million worth in July. This brings total common stock repurchase for the year through July to about $2.3 billion. We still have roughly $2.8 billion remaining on our board authorization. From a debt standpoint, we paid off or redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of debt and issued $500 million of senior debt.\nWe have now largely pre-funded our 2025 maturing debt issues and finally, at the end of the Q2 we had $4.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion. Turning to our recently published sustainability report, MetLife operates within a virtuous circle comprised of our customers, our people, our communities, and our shareholders, with the objective of delivering long-term value to each of these stakeholders. Perhaps nowhere is the success of these efforts more evident than in the pages of our annual sustainability report, and can be found on MetLife's website. In it you'll see highlights of our efforts to build more confident futures for our stakeholders and updates on our sustainability commitments.\nAmong our many successes, I am pleased to mention that the MetLife Foundation has surpassed $1 billion in total giving in its history as a 156-year-old company and the intent to log another 156 years more. Sustainability is an essential part of MetLife's heritage. As I close, one of the objectives of our Next Horizon strategy was to emerge as a stronger, more predictable company. As we approach the finish line of that five-year strategic cycle, we are on track to accomplish, if not exceed, each of the key targets and objectives we laid out relative to distributable cash, operating leverage, and return on equity. As I have said before, we do not stand still here at MetLife. We constantly look for opportunities to raise the bar and challenge ourselves further.\nPursuing these new challenges with passion and enthusiasm, we are hard at work developing and pressure testing our next five-year strategy, which we are calling New Frontier. This will build on the core pillars of Next Horizon while looking to accelerate growth, boost returns, and foster consistency. The first stop on this journey will begin with our annual Board Strategy Review in September. Subsequently, I look forward to sharing with you our plans for the future at our Investor Day scheduled for 12 December 2024. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the Q2 2024 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position.\nStarting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q2. We had net derivative losses primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the yen as well as higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by Market Risk Benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a higher rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continue to be modest, and our hedging program performed as expected. On page four you can see the Q2 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which do not have any notable items in either period.\nAdjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, up 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting volume growth and higher variable investment income drove the year-over-year increase. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.28, up 18% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $533 million, up 43% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable underwriting margin. The Group Life mortality ratio was a record low of 79.1%, well below our annual target range of 84% to 89, driven by favorable experience across all coverages. The strong Group Life results mirrored the notably low number of US deaths between the ages of 25 and 64 in April and May. According to CDC data regarding non medical health.\nThe interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in the quarter toward the bottom end of our annual target range of 69% to 74 and below the prior year quarter of 73.7%. Favorable disability results benefited from a reserve adjustment of approximately $30 million after tax. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year, taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6. Group Benefits Q2 2024 year to date sales were up 11%, driven by strong growth across most products, including our suite of voluntary products. RIS adjusted earnings were $410 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by higher variable investment income and strong volume growth.\nRAS Investment spreads are 121 basis points, down 6 basis points sequentially, mainly due to the expiration of interest rate caps in Q2 2024. We anticipate that spreads will remain between our annual target range of 115 and 140 basis points in the Q3. Although we foresee an increase in variable investment income, it will likely be balanced out by reduced earnings from the expiration of the interest rate caps. RAS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 4% year over year, primarily driven by strong sales of institutional income annuities as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we had approximately $3.5 billion in deals in the second quarter and continue to see an active market moving to Asia.\nAdjusted earnings were $449 million, up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and higher variable investment income for Asia's key growth metrics. General account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong prior year quarter, while Japan sales were down 19% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. This was more than offset by strong sales growth of 60% in the rest of the region, including a large group case in Australia. Latin America adjusted earnings were $226 million, up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting.\nThis was partially offset by lower Chilean and Encaje returns of -2.4% in Q2 2024 compared to a +1.4% in Q2 of the prior year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% or 12% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $77 million, up 10% and 20% on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year over year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 12% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 31% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey, the Gulf, and the UK. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 27% versus the prior year quarter.\nThe primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $220 million versus an adjusted loss of $228 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26. On page 5, this chart reflects our pre tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters including $298 million in Q2 2024. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the vast majority of the VII asset balance, had a +2.3% return in the quarter while our real estate equity funds had a -1.4% return in the quarter. As a reminder, both private equity and real estate equity funds are reported on a 1/4 lag.\nLooking ahead, we expect VII returns to continue to improve over the course of the H2 of the year. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and Q2 2024. As you can see in the chart, Asia, RIS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile.\nNow turning to page seven, the chart on the left of the page illustrates the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including Q2 2023 and Q2 2024. Adjusted net investment income in Q2 2024 was up $120 million year-over-year. Recurring investment income has benefited from higher interest rates, partially offset by the roll off of interest rate caps. In addition, we have seen VII improvement driven by higher private equity returns. Turning your attention to the right side of the page, this shows our new money yield versus roll off yield since Q2 2021. Over the last nine quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In Q2 2024, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6.27%, 63 basis points higher than the roll off rate.\nWe anticipate that the new money yields will remain above roll-off yields given the prevailing interest rate environment. However, the spread can fluctuate depending on the mix of sales across our businesses. Now moving to expenses discussed on page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2023 of 12.2% and the first half of 2024, both at 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the H2 of the year consistent with the seasonal nature of our business.\nThat said, our performance year to date positions us well to achieve a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page nine. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.4 billion at 30 June, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion, but down from $5.2 billion at 31 March. The sequential decline in holding company's cash is primarily the result of approximately $1.5 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption partially offset by a $500 million senior debt issuance in June. Beyond this, cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $900 million in Q2, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $270 million in July for our US.\nCompany's preliminary Q2 year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.9 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of 30 June 2024, down 2% from 31 March 2024, primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect that Japan Solvency Margin Ratio to be approximately 670% as of 30 June 2024, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\nBefore I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of 30 June in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios, as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident. With strong top-line growth, disciplined underwriting, and prudent expense management, our Group Benefits segment achieved record earnings. Higher interest rates continue to support flows and spreads, and we continue to see improvement in variable investment income. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses generating solid recurring free cash flow.\nWe are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. We'll go to our first question from Tom Gallagher at Evercore.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGood morning. Wanted to ask a couple on the Group Benefits business. First, can you just unpack the non-medical health results? How was the underlying Disability versus Dental? And also, can you just comment on pricing, maybe on both of those products, and how you think about renewals. Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of MetLife US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nSure. Tom, good morning. It's Ramy Tadros here. So I think just from a headline ratio perspective, just to reference John's remarks, the overall ratio of 70.8. You want to just normalize that for one-off, non-recurring reserve adjustment. So that gets you back into kind of the 72.2 range. So on your question on dental and disability, so in the Q2 for dental we did see utilization rates come down from the Q1 and what you're seeing here is just normal seasonality in that business, and where Q1 tends to be heavier in terms of utilization as these benefits reset typically at the beginning of the year. And in terms of how we think about dental and dental pricing going forward.\nIf you step back from the current quarter, as you know, dental is an inflationary product, and we do deploy a number of levers to ensure we manage and stay within our target margins. The two I would highlight here are that the majority of our claims come within our network, which gives us a greater line of sight and control over margin. The other key lever here is renewal pricing. This is a business where we remain disciplined in terms of our rate guarantee periods. In aggregate, we can reprice about 80% of our book every year. That's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been seeing overall trends in the last, kind of, call it, year and a half, tick up. We've seen pressure on margins because of that.\nWe've been taking appropriate action, pricing action, across the entire block in response to that trend. At this stage, most of these actions are behind us. We've implemented them across the book and going forward, we'll continue to kind of monitor the trend and take actions as necessary. Just think of that as more business as usual of how you manage an inflationary product like dental.\nOn disability. I would say the underlying block is running very much in line with expectations. We see some slight increases in incidents, but severity has come down and we continue to still see very strong recoveries.\nThe core business continues to be healthy and very much in line. I would say just on renewals in aggregate, we're hitting our target renewal pricing across the book, and we're still maintaining very strong persistency here. So we feel pretty good about both the new business, both about the renewal pricing coupled with our persistency. You clearly need to watch both in this business.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat, thanks for that, Ramy. Just my quick follow up. How are you feeling about the level of competition in the market? We've heard about new entrants putting some pressure on sales and pricing. Are you guys seeing that or is it not affecting you in terms of margin and pricing?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of MetLife US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nI mean, the short answer is that it's not affecting us. I would overall characterize the market as competitive, largely rational. You occasionally see aggressive pricing, but that is more of an outlier than the norm here. Tom, our perspective here is also informed by ongoing rigorous surveillance. We look at every single metric in the market on an ongoing basis. I would say we have not seen any evidence of a change in the competitive environment. The key point here for us is, as we've always talked about before, we have positioned this business to compete on a range of factors inclusive of price. So while price is important, the basis of how we compete extends to multiple factors beyond price.\nThis is ultimately a scale business. Capabilities matter, experience matter, product breadth matters. The ability to invest, which comes with scale, also really matters. Some of the new entrants that you've referenced are pretty small in terms of their overall premium size. They largely operate at the very small end of the market with narrower capabilities. We haven't seen any meaningful impact, or I say any impact on our book from those new competitors.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Suneet Kamath at Jefferies.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up on Group Benefits, the earnings power of this business has improved pretty substantially. I mean, normally think about this as maybe a $400 million business, and excluding the reserve release, you're over $500 million. Is that a sort of a sustainable level of earnings power for this business, or is there anything that we should be thinking about that maybe broke the right way in the quarter?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of MetLife US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nYeah, good morning, it's Ramy here again. I think the one item I would point to here is the Group Life ratio. This is a historical low for us. It's mainly driven by lower volume.\nThe lower volume, if you step back and look at the CDC data in terms of the all cause death in the US population, that has come down significantly in the Q2 as well. I would say that's the one here that was. Tailwind in the quarter, which we're pleased with. But if you think about our expectations on a go forward basis basis, we think mortality will kind of moderate back in line with historical levels. You'll still see the seasonality that you see in this business. So a better view of that on a run rate basis. I'll bring you back to our guidance range. If you look at that on a year to date basis, we're about 84.7. So I think that's the one that you want to kind of look out for in terms of, I would say the one item this quarter, which was material, which gave us a bit of a tailwind here.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. That makes sense. And then I guess on RIS, in terms of the spreads, I mean, I think last quarter you guided to maybe 8 bps to 10 of sequential compression. I think it came in much better than that. So just curious what you'd attribute that to. And then how should we be thinking about the progress of that spread, you know, as we kind of transition to Q3 and then ultimately Q4?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah, thanks, Suneet. It's John, good morning. You know, so as you mentioned, so in the quarter we came in at 121 basis points. That was within the 115 to 140 guidance. And then if you exclude VII, it was 119. And so a couple things, right, we saw continued improvement in VII in the quarter.\nAs you mentioned, we expected a decline from Q1 as a result of lower recurring interest margins, you know, due to the roll off of the interest rate caps. You know, we did anticipate VII to be 8 to 10. It came in less, and it's primarily due to higher than expected interest rates, which we took advantage of during the course of the quarter. So it was a little better than we thought. You know, having said that, I think our guidance that we gave last quarter is we continued to believe another 8 to 10 would occur during the course of Q3 on an ex-VII basis as most of the remaining interest rate caps mature over the course of the next few months. Then, you know, we should see spread stabilize in Q4.\nMost of the in-the-money interest rate caps purchased, you know, primarily during kind of pre- and even in the COVID era mature by then. So you know, that's kind of how I would kind of play out the rest of this year. And you know, I think if you go back to what we said at the outlook call, which was we thought all-in 2024 would show an all-in spread similar to 2023. That's generally where we're trending towards.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thanks John.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll move to Ryan Krueger at KBW.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I guess on Japan, could you give some perspective on the sales environment there? You know, I think you had, it was a tougher year-ago comparison, but you had some declines in sales. So just hoping to get a little more color on the different product areas there.\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nHey Ryan, it's Lyndon here. So let me give you some color on sales across Asia, including what we're seeing in Japan. So sales for the quarter grew 5% including our divested operations in Malaysia. We also saw a 5% growth in assets under management. While Japan single premium FX sales were impacted by the Yen weakness. We did see an offset when we look across the rest of Asia. Japan sales were lower in the single premium US dollar products. But as you said, we're up against a tough comparative.\nIn Q2, the weaker yen did impact the overall market for the foreign currency products. So if we look at the overall basket of markets, this market has shrunk, but we continue to maintain our share in this space. Look, we have a diversified portfolio and we are rebalancing between product mix between yen and US dollars. So if you look at the outlook for yen products, it has improved with the higher interest rates and also with the positive macro environment that we're seeing in Japan now. We have introduced a couple of new products, both the variable life as well as a cancer product, earlier this year and they both have performed very well. We've got other product launches planned in the pipeline, some coming in later this year as well as at the beginning of next year.\nWe've got strong growth in the rest of Asia, and that's also contributing to the overall story. We saw solid performance in Korea, in China, in India, and also strong year over year growth in all these countries. And then in the quarter in Japan, we benefited from a large group case which came on risk in the Q2. If we look at the outlook first half, actual sales were in line with the prior year, and we expect a similar trend as we go through the H2. So given this, we expect full year sales for Asia to be flat year-over-year. Hope that helps.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah, and I would just to correct, you know, it's a large group case in Australia. I think he mentioned Japan, but.\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nOh, sorry. Yeah, in Australia.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks. One quick follow up. I think there's been some elevated surrender activity in Japan. Just any more info on that and to what extent has that impacted earnings in recent quarters?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nYeah, now we did see some benefit in earnings. We saw a 4% increase in adjusted earnings on a reported as well as an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. This was driven both by favorable underwriting given by the surrenders as well as variable investment income. When you look at surrender activities, it was higher than expected in the quarter given we had the weaker yen as some customers choose to lock in some of their gains. And if we look at the VII in the quarter, Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds. And so in the quarter we did see better performance in the real estate relative to the prior year. We've also had good expense management in the quarter and that's contributed to the stronger earnings.\nIf you look at the outlook for the year, we expect full year earnings to kind of remain strong in line with guidance. VII performance will continue to be a factor that will impact our earnings going forward.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Wes Carmichael at Autonomous Research.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing on Japan for a second. With the SSMR ratio around 670% in the quarter. Could you maybe just give us an update regarding the transition to ESR in Japan if there's been any material changes in how you're feeling about implementation at the point?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nHey, hey Wes, it's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, 670 is our estimate for the quarter. We'll file that in a few weeks. I'd just like to start out by saying no concerns around capital generation or dividends. Right. And you know that ratio tends to have some asymmetrical impacts when rates rise. But as we know the overall economic value of the business is improve. So the other thing we saw in this quarter is it's generally a heavier cash out quarter for us. We have higher dividends, we pay taxes. So there's a little bit of timing there. And then as you mentioned, you know, the new ESR comes into effect 1 April 2025. We'll report on that for the first time 31 March 2026. And that is more of an economic framework, one of which that we have typically managed this business.\nYou know, we've used economic as well as stat as we think about like product pricing and development and things like that. So that's you know, kind of a good place to start from. In addition, you know, I'd say implementation is going well. We don't see any big issues. There's some, a few items that we're just continuing to work through, you know, with the regulation. But even if those don't come to fruition, we can certainly manage. But we're hopeful to make some improvements to the kind of the current situation. All in, we're comfortable and I'd say supportive of moving from the SMR to the ESR.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, John. Just maybe switching to the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. I think the loan-to-value ratio has deteriorated a little bit, at least in office, quarter-over-quarter. But could you give us an update on your watch list? List any loans that are in the foreclosure process and if there's any properties, you know, where you might be expecting to take them on balance sheet. Thanks.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nOkay, great, thanks. Thanks, Wes. A lot in there to unpack, but let me just maybe start with my LTV. So as you mentioned, and we kind of forecasted this in the first quarter, we thought, you know, a year prior we had kind of given some peak-to-trough views. We thought it had another 10% broadly to go in some of the more distressed areas.\nAs you know, when we go through our annual appraisal process, it happens throughout the year. We typically wait for the Q2. We find it hard to do it in the Q1 because we'd like to get financial information in our hands before we start that. So, you know, Q2 tends to be a heavy revaluation quarter. And so that's kind of what we saw happen. Generally in line with expectations overall.\nLTV ticked up a point overall, a couple points more in office. Then as we look out for the rest of this year, probably the heavier ones were done in Q2. We'll still see some, I'd say, modest deterioration, maybe another point overall in H2 and a little more, maybe a couple points in office. Look, I think, I think it's playing out as expected. You know, last year we had write-offs of roughly $20 million. We think this year you're in kind of closer to maybe $100 million, but maybe below. So still modest. We had a little under $30 million year to date so far and we think we're on track for kind of that, you know, kind of closer to $100 million of write-offs for the year.\nVery well within, you know, kind of the modest area for us in terms of our capital, size, and position. So again, we think, you know, the environment is, despite the pressure, you know, economic growth remains healthy. And that's actually good news for real estate fundamentals. You know, despite office sector still probably has some, you know, kind of some work to do there. But you also have moderating construction pipeline which is benefiting all properties. And so, you know, this is how this, this, this sector generally works out. It takes time, doesn't happen overnight.\nYou need to be well positioned going into it to, you know, to be able to kind of manage through the, you know, kind of the pressure, the distress, and generally the demand and supply factors typically work themselves out. So all in all, I think things are performing as expected for us and no change to our view.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Jimmy Bhullar at J.P. Morgan.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. My questions are mostly answered, but I just wanted to follow up on a couple of points. First on Japan, the decline in sales that you saw, how much of that is just a function of comps and maybe the volatility in the yen depressing sales of forex products versus an uptick in competition, or price reductions by competitors, or other market dynamics that are causing you to actively pull back?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. So, yeah, look, we did have a tough comparative last year. I think sales in Japan were up over 40% when we look at last year. So that is driving a lot of the, a lot of the results this year. But we are also seeing a weaker yen and this has impacted the overall market for foreign currency products. The bank market, as I said, has declined, but we continue to maintain our market position over there. So I do think the volatility in the yen is driving some of the decline we're seeing in sales.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then on RIS spreads, I think you've been clear that there's rate gaps that are expiring later this year or in Q3. But should we assume that they'll stabilize in Q4 on a core basis? And then are there other puts and takes as you're thinking about spreads going into next year, whether it's caps or sort of maturity of blocks or anything else business coming out of surrender to period, that would drive a shift in spread margins one way or the other.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. Yes, as I was alluding to in kind of the opening remarks and earlier is that we do have another quarter of eight bps to 10 is what we forecasted. Like I said earlier, we thought we were going to have eight to 10 this quarter, but interest rates are a bit higher than we had assumed at the time. We were discussing this in the Q1, and we took advantage of that and a few different things we could do. So then the remainder, most of the remaining interest rate caps roll off this quarter, and then you should see stabilization. Also, we're projecting VII to marginally increase each of the next two quarters as well, kind of similar to the trend that we saw here. So that would be kind of the offset comment I'd make to you.\nThen you should see some stabilization in the Q4 in terms of beyond that. We'll wait for Outlook to go through that information.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOn competition in Japan, is it still rational or are you seeing any evidence of price reductions with the higher interest rates in that market?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nLook, I mean, it is a competitive environment, but I would say it's rational, where we always see a player get more aggressive once in a while. But we continue to maintain our pricing discipline and our focus on profitability. We've got a very diversified distribution platform. We've got a wide range of products that both yen as well as US dollar. We've got good investment origination capabilities along with strong internal reinsurance capabilities. So all this combined kind of puts us in a good position, allows us to differentiate and maintain our competitive position in the market.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. Good morning. My first question, maybe starting on the PRT side, can you just give some color just on what you see in the pipeline for the back half of this year and just any change in the competitive market for that business?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nRegional President of MetLife US Business and Head of MetLife Holdings, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. You know, with respect to the pipeline, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline here, particularly on the larger end of the market, which is where we focus and where we have competitive advantages. You know, if you step beyond the next couple of quarters, there are just secular trends here that bode really well for us and how we're positioned. If you survey corporate DB plan sponsors, and survey after survey, including ours, they all point to a significant and rising proportion of those plan sponsors who are looking to de-risk and transfer the risk. You also have a very large stock of corporate DB assets, $3 trillion. If you look at the private market only.\nYou've got funding status that's pretty good, which makes all of these risk transfers a lot more affordable. These will always be lumpy. Sitting here now, looking at the rest of the year, we're seeing a pretty healthy jumbo pipeline. We're also very pleased with what we've done this quarter. As you saw, we did $3.5 billion of PRT, and we're clearly very pleased with, with our performance here.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Maybe the second question on Asia, the earnings were pretty strong in the quarter. I think you guys called out favorable underwriting, maybe in the prepared remarks. Anything just more to think about, just kind of the run rate, earnings within that segment, and anything that stood out in the quarter?\n\nLyndon Oliver\n\nRegional President of MetLife Asia, MetLife\n\nYeah, hi, Elyse, it's Lyndon here. As I said earlier, I mean, we're pleased with the overall results in Asia. For earnings in the quarter, we did see higher than expected surrender activity, and that was driven by the weaker Yen as some customers start to lock in their gains. That was higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we did see. Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds. In the quarter we saw better performance in real estate relative to the prior year. So those two are sort of drivers for the strong earnings results in the quarter for Asia.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John Barnidge at Piper Sandler.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the opportunity. With the capital regime change in Japan, is there an opportunity to broaden out the Bermuda platform, create more capital light model? Thank you.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nHey, John, it's John. Good morning. I'll take that one. So look, I think that's something we've always had in place for quite some time. We actually have two Bermuda entities right now and we've had them for close to a decade in place. So it's a tool we have used and probably one that we have used.\nSuccessfully with some of our Japan products. I think ESR will allow you to reevaluate some of that and determine what's fit for purpose. And it's really, we look at one of the factors we always consider as we kind of take our own internal economic model and think about what's prudent level of capital, and then we evaluate that relative to, you know, some of the, you know, jurisdiction requirements. So, but, but certainly Bermuda has been and continues to be an optimization tool for us, and I think we'll continue to do that. Not just, and by the way, not just with Japan. Sometimes we use it with other jurisdictions as well.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks for the answer, John. The follow-up question is on the opportunity to leverage large data that you have. Can you talk about the opportunity set? Is it about driving greater profitability, revenues, close rates, or persistency? Thanks.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah, hi John, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So, you know, as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, we've been investing in technology and capabilities, and you know, that's part of our sort of the efficiency mindset that we've built here, freeing up capacity to make those important investments. And you know, the fact that, you know, we have size here, we have, you know, a lot of data, obviously, you know, is an advantage because we're. Able to leverage this data.\nI would say there are three areas where, you know, we've seen, you know, in some cases early signs, in other cases, you know, more advanced signs of, you know, real impact on progress. One is around the customer experience.\nAnd again, if you think about that, very important in terms of meeting not only current but, you know, future customer expectations, driving our competitive advantage. I think the other area where we're seeing potential impact is around driving revenue growth. So technology and data can help drive that. And the third area is around efficiency. And again here we see significant opportunities. You can see from our Direct Expense Ratio which has come in at below the 12.3 guidance that we provided in the first half and our expectation is that, you know, whereas we'll see sort of a tick up in the second half, which is typical, we will still expect to come in under the 12.3.\nYou know, I would say going forward, you know, those investments that we're making and our ability to leverage data will continue to, you know, to drive sort of a downward trend when it comes to that as well.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you for that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Mike Ward at Citi.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Financial Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to ask about Holdings de-risking. Curious how active those discussions are. Any kind of pressure or change in activity to execute before FOMC, or is it agnostic to that? Any update?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife",
    "content2": "Hey, Mike, good morning. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think. I can't remember the last time we spoke about this, but I'd say that, you know, obviously we did the transaction back in November of last year, and I think the environment has continued to progress as the way I think we would put it. We are still in the same position today, which is that we don't, you know, we are continuing to meet with third parties. We continue to explore opportunities. You know, this needs to be kind of a win-win. But there's no burning platform where we have to do something. So it's a real, it's an opportunity. It's not a requirement for us to. Or necessity for us. That requires continuous discussions, evaluation reviews. You know, we did a large non-traditional life transaction last year. We generally have traditional life blocks left.\nWe have obviously LTC and then we have VA, and you know, obviously the traditional life is very attractive to people, but it's also very attractive to us in terms of returns. So I think, you know, that would be priority one, and then the other ones, you know, there's a limited supply of partners that would be willing to kind of think about that. So you're talking about a more narrow universe. So you continue to discuss those things, and we're happy to manage it ourselves. But if we're able to find unique opportunities, then we'll do that. But I would say it's ongoing discussions continue, but no material changes in terms of momentum.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Financial Analyst, Citi\n\nHelpful. Thanks, John. And then maybe on private credit seems to be an area of attention. Maybe a bit frothy. Just curious how you guys see that landscape. Are you leaning in or being more cautious? And I guess. What's your strategy? How do you balance having the ability to originate directly versus investing it in some of the boutique shops that you've done.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nHey, it's John again. It's an interesting question. I think first, definitionally, private credit probably has 100 different definitions out there. So that's always a tough one to kind of decide which one you're talking, which everyone's talking about. But I think at the end of the day, we have been in private credit, broadly speaking, for 150 years.\nRight? I mean, you can, you can pretty, if you cast a wide net there, you know, whether it's our, you know, commercial mortgage loan origination. We have an ag loan platform. We're the largest ag loan lender outside of the US government.\nYou know, we're, I think we're the number one infrastructure lender as well. And so, and you know, but we typically were higher grade, and we have some higher yielding products as well. And so we have a number of origination platforms. It's something we talked about over, you know, over the years as a unique capability for us. To your point, it's an area that everyone has been jumping in. So now you need to be much, you know, very disciplined in your approach. There is kind of a hot, you know, kind of view around the term private credit. And so, you know, we, we have, we have approached it our way, which is for the long term is the way we think about it. And so, you know, I think that's just our approach, and everyone has their own unique approach to it.\nThere are sectors that are much more competitive today that I think we would say you need to be mindful of.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Financial Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. Have a great summer.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on MetLife's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. In addition to our earnings release, we issued a press release last night announcing a $3 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nOn the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. As usual, last night we released our standard set of supplemental slides, which are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.\nAn appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. Given the busy morning, Q&A will end promptly just before the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from last night's report, MetLife is getting off to a good start for the year. We delivered another solid quarter of financial results, reflecting strong top-line growth, consistent execution, and sustained momentum across our market-leading portfolio of businesses.\nWe achieved this mindful that change and uncertainty remain constants in the current environment. Our resilience and consistency are made possible by the unwavering commitment of our associates, our unabated confidence in our all-weather next horizon strategy, and our unyielding focus on controlling those factors we can control to drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. With change as a persistent backdrop, MetLife's 156-year track record of risk management is stable stakes for our customers and shareholders.\nAs I addressed in my shareholder letter, central to this notion is protecting our balance sheet so we can meet the promises we've made to our policyholders and shareholders, regardless of economic or geopolitical conditions. Risk management extends across virtually everything we do, the way we invest and manage our capital and liquidity to the way we price, underwrite, and reserve for the products we sell.\nAnother element of risk management at MetLife lies in our diversification. We operate across a range of products and geographies, many that have offsetting risk characteristics such as mortality versus longevity, among others. Even within our business segments, we have diversification. Our group benefits business serves employers across a wide range of business sizes and industries and has customers in every state.\nA similar theme runs through retirement and income solutions and can be seen in the multiple liability streams we are able to originate: capital markets, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, stable value, corporate-owned life insurance, and longevity reinsurance, among others. Our diversification is at the core of who we are and further differentiates MetLife. It is not coincidence, but by design. We have constructed a platform to deliver for the long term and believe our diversification promotes both sustainable and responsible growth.\nTurning to the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, or $1.83 per share, up 20% per share from the prior year period. This was aided by a partial rebound in variable investment income led by private equity gains, which delivered a positive return of 2.1%. In the aggregate, net income for the Q1 was $800 million, well above $14 million from the prior year period.\nTop-line growth was strong across our market-leading set of businesses, with adjusted premiums, fees, and other revenues, or PFOs, totaling $12 billion, up 4% compared to the Q1 of 2023. On a constant currency basis, PFOs were up 5%. Our unrelenting focus on execution continues to drive positive results across important key metrics.\nMetLife posted a 13.8% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, still within the 13% to 15% target range, despite VII not yet hitting a more normal quarterly run rate. Our direct expense ratio of 11.9% improved from a year ago and was lower than our 12.3% annual target. The positive leverage captured by this ratio illustrates our ability to control costs as well as grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses.\nShifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, group benefits generated $6.3 billion of adjusted PFOs, up 5%, or up 6% adjusting for participating policies from the prior year period, driven by solid growth across most products, including further expansion in voluntary benefits. Our premier national accounts franchise continues to demonstrate its differentiation and deliver value to customers through its comprehensive range of products and a customer experience enhanced by innovative technology platforms.\nIn the quarter, group benefits adjusted earnings of $284 million was impacted by seasonally high life mortality and seasonally elevated non-medical health utilization, returning to a historical trend more recently matched by the pandemic. Showing the continued vitality of this flagship business, sales were up 25% from the prior year, propelled by our sustained efforts to drive enrollment, which pushed growth across core and voluntary products. Last month, MetLife launched our 2024 employee benefit trend study.\nIn its 22nd year, the survey tracks evolving employer and employee dynamics and the impact that macro environment and other trends have on the workplace and the employee benefits ecosystem. Through the years, we've enjoyed tremendous engagement with our customers as a result of the survey's demonstrated thought leadership, and this year's survey, with its focus on employee care, was no different. The business case for employee care is clear.\nOur research and other studies show that when organizations offer a range of benefits, employees are more holistically healthy, and business performance is stronger. As the largest group benefits provider, this ties directly into our strategy to offer the widest array of products, which gives MetLife more opportunities to serve our customers and more avenues to drive growth. Our leading retirement and income solutions business reported adjusted earnings of $399 million, essentially flat with last year.\nHigher interest rates continue to increase the attractiveness of many of the products we offer within RIS. Overall, quarterly sales in RIS were $2.7 billion, up 49% from the prior year, led by structured settlements, and corporate-owned life insurance production. Our business in Asia posted a 51% increase in adjusted earnings on better variable investment income and favorable underwriting, particularly in Japan.\nSales, while robust, were down relative to a strong quarter a year ago. Yet, illustrating the strength of recent quarters, assets under management in Asia are up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, our momentum continues across the region, particularly in our two largest markets of Mexico and Chile. The segment generated another record quarter of adjusted earnings, with $233 million rising 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis.\nMoving to capital and cash, our operative philosophy on capital deployment relies on a balance across investing in organic and inorganic growth, and returning capital to shareholders via common dividends and share repurchase. During Q1, MetLife leaned into capital management. We paid $377 million to shareholders via common stock dividends, and we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our common stock.\nAfter the quarter, we have repurchased about another $300 million of common stock in April. Also in April, we boosted our common dividend per share by 4.8%. Year-to-date through April, we have repurchased about $1.5 billion of our common shares. Along with reporting our Q1 results, you saw that we also announced the addition of $3 billion to our repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $3.6 billion, which allows us to proceed with repurchase at a more measured pace for the balance of the year.\nShifting to governance, we announced during the quarter that Laura Hay joined our board of directors effective in February. Most recently, she was the global head of KPMG's insurance practice. We are excited to have Laura bring her broad set of actuarial and financial skills, and her business experience to our board. In closing, as we near the conclusion of our five-year Next Horizon framework, we are engaged in a thoughtful process to chart the next course of our strategic journey, building on a strong, well-established foundation.\nI don't anticipate an abrupt departure from what has successfully delivered on our purpose, always with you building a more confident future, but rather a further evolution. As we've sought to raise the bar during Next Horizon, asking more of ourselves and delivering more than our stated goals, we've already started advancing towards the next phase of our strategy. The core principles of Next Horizon anchor our future actions, and we remain embedded in our strategic thinking as we move ahead.\nWe are building on a strong foundation with a growth mindset and a range of opportunities that would not have been possible just a few years ago. We are well-positioned to further differentiate ourselves and deliver additional value to customers, fueling higher levels of growth. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our scale and harness emerging technologies to drive margin expansion, all the while achieving greater overall operating consistency.\nTaken together, we believe these powerful factors will result in greater returns for our shareholders. To that end, I look forward to discussing our refreshed strategy at an investor day here in New York on 12 December 2024. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our Q1 performance in greater detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the Q1 2024 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q1.\nWe had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the yen and Chilean peso, as well as favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset by market risk-benefit, or MRB, remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a rising rate environment.\nOverall, the investment portfolio remains well-positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and our hedging program performed as expected. On page four, you can see the Q1 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which do not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 13% on a reported, and constant currency basis. Higher variable investment income, due to a rebound in private equity returns, drove the year-over-year increase.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $1.83, up 20% and up 21% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $284 million, down 7% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins. The group-like mortality ratio was 90.2%, a slight improvement versus Q1 of 2023 of 90.5%, and above the top end of our annual target range of 84%-89%, as group-like mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the Q1.\nRegarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.9% in the quarter, at the top end of its annual target range of 69%-74%, in line with our expectation of higher seasonal dental utilization in the Q1. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 6% year-over-year, and at the top end of our 2024 target growth range of 4%-6%.\nIn addition, group benefits sales were up 25%, driven by strong growth across core and voluntary products. RIS adjusted earnings were $399 million, essentially flat versus Q1 of 2023. Higher variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins, as well as less favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 127 basis points, at the midpoint of our annual target range of 115-140 basis points.\nThis incorporates both the impact of the roll-off of our interest rate caps and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, while we did not complete any transaction in the Q1, we continue to see an active market.\nMoving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $423 million, up 51% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins, and favorable tax benefits in Q1 2024. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis versus a strong prior year quarter.\nLatin America adjusted earnings were $233 million, up 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. In addition, solid Chilean and Encaje returns of 4.8% in Q1 2024 compared to a negative 0.9% in Q1 of the prior year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.\nAMI adjusted earnings were $77 million, up 28% and 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable underwriting, volume growth, and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. While AMI adjusted earnings were above trend this quarter, we still view the run rate to be $60 to $65 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. AMI adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey and the UK.\nMetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings were $159 million versus $158 million in the prior year quarter. Higher private equity returns were offset by roughly $50 million in foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November, in line with expectations. Adjusted earnings in the quarter were also pressured by a true-up associated with the reinsurance transaction. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $241 million versus an adjusted loss of $236 million in the prior year.\nThe company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23%, below our 2024 guidance range of 24%-26%, due to several favorable tax items in the quarter. On page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $260 million in Q1 2024. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance, had a positive 2.1% return in the quarter, while real estate equity funds had a negative 5.8% return in Q1 2024.\nBoth are reported on a one-quarter lag. In addition, as we've seen signs of improvement in PE secondary markets, we have opportunistically divested roughly $750 million of private equity general account assets in Q1 2024 at a modest discount. The transaction structure will allow MetLife Investment Management to continue managing the assets from the sale.\nWe believe this transaction, which is similar to the roughly $1 billion divestment that we made in 2022, is a thoughtful approach to managing our investment allocation while supporting an important and growing fee-generating business for MetLife. Looking ahead, we continue to expect VII returns to move toward the upper end of our near-term outlook range in the second half of the year, and we remain comfortable with our full-year VII guidance of $1.5 billion.\nOn page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters of 2023 and Q1 of 2024. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long-dated liability profile. Now, turning to page seven, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q1 of 2023 versus Q1 of 2024. Adjusted net investment income in Q1 of 2024 was up roughly $500 million, or 10% year-over-year.\nWhile recurring investment income moderated in the quarter due to the roll-off of the interest rate caps, we did see a solid recovery in PE returns driving the VII improvement year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since Q1 2021, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past eight quarters, consistent with the rising rates.\nIn the Q1 of 2024, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6.6%, 103 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. Keep in mind, the roll-off rate can fluctuate from period to period, as it did in the Q1 due to a greater volume of higher-yielding floating-rate assets paying off. We would expect this positive trend of new money yields outpacing roll-off yields to persist given the current level of interest rates.\nNow, let's switch gears to discuss expenses on page eight. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year 2023 of 12.2% and Q1 2024 of 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full-year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline.\nWe were off to a good start achieving a full-year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page nine. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.2 billion at 31 March 2024, which is above our target cash buffer of $3-$4 billion.\nThis includes approximately $1.4 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption. We do not have any further debt maturities for the balance of the year. Beyond this, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $1.2 billion in the Q1, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $330 million in April.\nRegarding our statutory capital for our US companies, our 2023 Combined NAIC-RBC Ratio was 407%, which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our US companies, preliminary Q1 2024 Statutory Operating Earnings were approximately $1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $570 million.\nWe estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.3 billion as of 31 March 2024, down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to dividends paid and surplus notes repaid, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of 31 March 2024, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\nBefore I wrap up, I would just highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of 31 March 2024 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected, with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios, as well as the expectation of modest losses. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered another solid quarter to begin the new year.\nThe underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident, with strong top-line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. In addition, our core spreads remain robust and sustainable given the higher yield environment. Also, we saw a nice rebound in our private equity returns. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects of our businesses over the near term and beyond.\nMetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength, with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, which generates solid recurring free cash flow. We are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, you may press one, then zero on your telephone keypad. You will hear acknowledgment that your line has been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from this queue at any time by pressing the one, zero key once again. One moment, please, for the first question. We have a question from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, thanks. I just wanted to start with VII. John, you'd mentioned, I think, a real estate loss of 5.8%. Can you just unpack that a little bit? Was that actually losses on sales or appraisals? And how do you see that tracking as we move through the balance of the year?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nSure. Good morning, Suneet. Primarily appraisals and valuation. So we actually saw, if you recall, in Q4, it was fairly flat. Appraisals, they tend to lag a bit in terms of just market declines. And so we saw kind of a catch-up of that in the fourth quarter, which obviously gets reported here in the Q1.\nOur view is that it will start to moderate. We probably still have some pressure in Q2, but less so, and then moderates through the rest of this year and then we think you start to see things start to pick up in a positive way towards the latter part of this year into 2025. That's kind of the outlook, if you will.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That makes sense. And then I guess, Michel, on your comments for future share buybacks, I think you used the word measured pace. Is that measured pace relative to what you did in the Q1, or is that relative to what you did in April? Is the plan to exhaust the $3.6 billion authorization in 2024?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Suneet. Thanks for the question. So yeah, I did use the word measure, and I was referring to Q1. But I think, as you've seen in Q1 and what you've seen from us over time, is that we do move expeditiously and deliberately to return capital to shareholders, especially in the absence of other high-value capital deployment opportunities following divestments.\nWe did so following the spinoff of our former retail business, following the sale of Auto & Home, and we closed on our risk transfer deal in Q4. So looking ahead and without me getting overly prescriptive, I would say that we leaned into Q1 at a pace that is greater than what you might see for the balance of the year.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Michel.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nThanks. Good morning. First, I just wanted to clarify one thing on the variable investment income comment. John, did you say that you expected to be towards the higher end of the range that you had given for the balance of the year?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, Ryan. It's John. I think Suneet's question was focused on real estate. So I think what we were just trying to—and regarding outlook in terms of the real estate funds. So we saw a negative return this quarter of 5.8%. I mentioned I thought it would be less negative next quarter, but we still think there'll be a little pressure in just kind of the appraisals coming through. And then it'll kind of moderate from there and start to have an upward trajectory is kind of the way we put it.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nOkay. Got it. Other question was on the group benefits business. Can you talk more about the competitive environment you're seeing at this point as you went through January 1 renewals as well as what you saw with persistency in pricing?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nSure, Ryan. It's Ramy here. Good morning. I would say in terms of our view of the competitive dynamics of the group business, it really hasn't changed. I mean, we've always talked about this as a competitive marketplace. One, because of the short-tail nature of this business, is on the whole rational. We also think and see that this is a market where there are many avenues for differentiation beyond price.\nLook, if you have the scale to invest in the business, you can create true differentiation in this market and grow profitability and grow profitably. Price, while important, becomes one out of multiple factors in the consideration set. With that background, we're very pleased with our growth in sales this year. You saw the 25% increase in sales year-over-year. I should note that the strength of that momentum was across the board: so life, disability, dental, as well as our voluntary suite of products.\nFrom a pricing perspective, we're very pleased with the rate adequacy we got for that new business. We're also very pleased with the rate increases that we got on renewals that were commensurate with our targets. In all, a pretty solid picture, both in terms of the growth, persistency, as well as the pricing and the rate increases.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we move on to Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for the question. I had a question on pension risk transfer. I know you guys didn't have any deals in the quarter, but there were some deals that were done that were reasonable size. It appears MET has plenty of capital to support this marketplace right now.\nThere's actually another ongoing call right now that one of your peers is saying that PRT is not that good of a business this year. There's not as much spread. I'm just wondering if pricing is getting more competitive there or if there's any dynamics changing in the marketplace.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nThank you, Wes. It's Ramy here again. Look, we're coming off a very successful 2023 year in terms of PRT. We wrote five cases totaling more than $5 billion in premium, and that was off the back of a record year in 2022 where we wrote more than $12 billion of premiums. This business is lumpy. I would remind you, we did not win any deals in Q1 of 2023 either, and we did not win any deals in Q1 of 2024.\nHaving said that, we continue to see a very robust pipeline ahead of us, particularly for the jumbo end of the market where we focus. This is not surprising. We've got very healthy funding levels of defined benefit plans and the desire for large plan sponsors to de-risk. We see this trend continuing for many, many years, and we're well positioned to win our fair share of the market here.\nFrom a pricing perspective, I would just emphasize what we've always said is that we look at these jumbo PRT deals with an M&A lens. You need to do that given the large quantum of capital that any given deal can consume. We're very disciplined to ensure that we deploy that capital to its best and highest use.\nWe evaluate each transaction carefully. We will only deploy capital if the risk-adjusted returns are healthy and the ROEs are aligned with our enterprise targets. As you look forward, we still see this as a large profit pool, a big opportunity, and one where we're going to get our fair share.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, Ramy. And Michel, I think you talked about higher rates increasing the attractiveness of your products. Just wanted to get a little perspective on capital deployment and how you're thinking about allocating capital towards growth in capital-intensive businesses where you can generate good IRRs versus buying back more stock, which continues to be pretty strong?\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Sure, Wes. Thanks for the question. Our philosophy and approach is that we want to support organic growth. We've been doing so consistently. You can see from our VMB disclosures the returns that we've been able to generate, high teens and paybacks, and sort of mid-single digits. We like a good balance in terms of supporting organic deploying capital in support of organic growth.\nWe continue to be in the flow looking at potential M&A transactions. We consider M&A to be a strategic capability here, but we're extremely disciplined when it comes to strategic fit and sort of a consistent basis globally by which we look at M&A transactions.\nThen excess capital, as we've said, belongs to our shareholders. We want to continue to have an attractive dividend yield. You can see that we increased our dividend by 4.8%, and then share repurchases, it's also sort of part of the equation. It's that balance that we like to maintain. We're certainly very keen on continuing to deploy capital in support of organic growth at attractive returns.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. So first, I had a question for John on your spreads in RIS. Healthy overall, but we saw a sequential decline in spreads excluding variable investment income. I think you attributed that to the expiration of some of the interest rate caps. So I'm wondering if you could give us some idea on the trajectory of that and should we assume sort of a similar level of an impact from caps that are expiring in the next few quarters, and when should we assume that that dynamic's going to be over?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think it was pretty much in line in terms of the roll-off of the caps. In terms of XVI, that was generally in line. I think VII came in better than we expected. As you recall, we talked about a 115-140 spread range for the segment. The middle of the range was 127 for the year. We still think that's the right answer. The way we got there was that we have kind of a quarterly roll-off of these interest rate caps.\nRemember, we bought these back a while ago when there wasn't a risk of rising rates, but it's to protect against a short-end rise fairly quickly, so that it allows the long end to kind of emerge in over time. It's basically worked as planned. They all effectively roll off for the most part throughout this year. In terms of expectations, we'll see another, so I think it was 10 basis points maybe decline between Q4 and Q1. I think eight to 10 next quarter is not a bad estimate. It'll depend on what VII does next quarter. We still think VII has kind of a reemergence to occur.\nWe had a good quarter this quarter, but that can gradually grow throughout the year, probably a bigger growth in the second half. Then probably have one more quarter of eight to 10 basis points occurring, and it flattens out between Q3 and Q4.\nBasically, it's minimal, if not immaterial, roll-off. So that's how to think about the roll-off, and that's how we get to the midpoint of that range when we gave the guidance. Obviously, in the past, we've spent quite a bit of time on VII, and we're happy to give that number, but we're really looking at the total spread all in now and as you think about the reemergence of VII.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Then for Ramy on margins and group benefits, I think group life margins, you'd assume that they'd be weak in Q1 because of seasonality. Dental claims picked up as well. Do you attribute most of that to seasonality as well, or are you seeing just higher incidence for some reason?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nHey, Jimmy. It's basically a seasonality story. As you know, with dental claims, the benefits reset at the end of the calendar year. Come January, you just get to see more utilization as the claims reset. Therefore, that's just a seasonally higher ratio. If you look at our overall non-medical health ratio, this Q1 seasonality is baked into our guidance ranges. I'd remind you these are annual ranges.\nOur expectations are at this point that we'll be well within our range, 69-74 for the full year. I would also remind you that we did lower that range by a point earlier this year. Very much a seasonality story and feel very good about being within that range for the full year.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we move to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Just a few follow-ups to Jimmy's questions. John, if I followed your math, that would suggest about 20 basis points of lower base spreads for RIS versus Q1 level if I look toward the end of 2024. Is that directionally right?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Eight to 10. You took the top end of that range, but sure. It's close. So 16-20.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nSixteen to 20.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Then, Ramy, for group benefits, I just want to make sure I have the right expectation here. If I look at last year and I look at the last three quarters of the year, I think earnings averaged around $450 million. That's probably $170, $180 million above what you did in Q1 this year. Is it fair to say you still expect to grow above the $450 million earnings level for the next three quarters?\nIn other words, it was just worse seasonality this year. Then is it—and said another way, it sounds like dental utilization was quite high. You fully expect to recover and see a big earnings snapback in dental for the balance of the year. Thanks.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nHey, Tom. The way you can triangulate to an earnings number, you need to take our top line and our guidance ratios. From a top-line perspective, we're still very much within the 4%-6% range. We got a 6% PFO growth this quarter, but think of that ratio being close to the midpoint of the range for the full year. For sure, think of both non-medical health, which includes dental, moderating for the full year. Think of that coming towards the midpoint of the range. Think of the same thing happening with the life underwriting ratio.\nVery much a seasonality story for this quarter. Remember, as Michel alluded in his remarks, that seasonality was kind of masked in the last few years with COVID, and different behaviors on the dental side, and clearly on the mortality side in terms of what we've seen. That's just now returning to a more regular pattern, if you will. I hope that helps you think through the guidance growth, both given the top-line number that I've articulated as well as the midpoint of these ratios for the full year.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat does. If I could just sneak in one other follow-up. Dental utilization, you would fully expect that to be far lower in Q2 than Q1. Or is there going to be some tail on that where you might see some level of higher utilization and lower earnings into Q2 as well, would you say?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nQ3 tends to be the lightest. You'd expect it to come down in the second quarter. Q3 will be a lot lighter. There's going to be always, there will be a decrease, whether it's going to happen as a sharp cliff in Q2 and then another one in Q3 or different pattern. It's hard to predict. Again, think of it as a full-year range and think of that ratio coming to the midpoint for the full year.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nTom, maybe I'll just add follow-up again on your first question. I think also just you only focused on XVII. But as I said, I think what's really important is that we think of the all-in spread here. All of that is very much in line with what we gave in the outlook for the midpoint of the range.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we move on to Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Tucker\n\nAssociate Director, Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi. This is Justin Tucker on for Brian. Thank you for taking my call. My first question is about RIS. When looking at the structured settlement results, could you kind of help us understand how much of the demand is driven by the favorable interest rate environment, and then how much of it is driven by the courts opening and social inflation? Then furthermore, just curious about the sensitivity to those factors. If interest rates do decrease, do you think that has a bigger impact on structured settlement demand versus dampening of social inflation? Thank you.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of US Business, MetLife\n\nHi. It's Ramy here. I mean, I would say interest rates are the primary driver of this. You have seen coming out of the pandemic, call it pent-up demand with the courts being closed. Some of that clearly kind of caused an increase in volumes earlier on. That's now stabilized, and it's very much an interest rate-driven volume increase. You do have, given structured settlements have increased, you do have some social inflation component.\nI would say interest rates is the primary one. We're a major player in this market. The market has grown substantially over the last few years, and we have maintained a pretty good share in that market. It's a very specialized market in terms of the distribution channel, the underwriting, etc. We're extremely pleased both with the volume, but as importantly with the ROEs and the returns we're able to achieve in this market.\n\nJustin Tucker\n\nAssociate Director, Equity Research, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Then my follow-up question is just on Latin America. Sales were flat year-over-year. I'm just curious about what you're seeing in the overall market for demand and what you expect with sales going forward. Thank you.\n\nEric Clurfain\n\nRegional President, Latin America, MetLife\n\nYes. Hi, Justin. Thanks for the question. This is Eric. Overall, we're pleased really with our results this quarter. This is a good start of the year after what was a record year in 2023. The quarter's results are primarily driven by favorable underwriting, some of which we don't expect to recur, strong and favorable returns, and solid volume growth. To your question, from a top-line perspective, we've seen all key markets contributing to solid, high single-digit PFO growth. That was supported by solid sales and strong persistency.\nFrom a sales perspective specifically, this quarter is a tough compare given that last year we had a 36% growth, which included two large employee benefits and corporate pension sales in Mexico and Brazil. Now, if you exclude these two sales from 2023, our sales are up roughly 10% year-over-year. All in all, we're really pleased with the growth trajectory and the momentum in the region. We believe that the outlook guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year.\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no other questions. I'll be turning the conference back to John Hall for closing comments.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, operator. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning on a very busy day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the MetLife Q4 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release, and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Q4 2023 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the investor relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook.\nThey are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook, sensitivities, disclosures, gap reconciliations, and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up with. That over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and good morning. Everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify, and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market leading businesses, driving strong results for the year and the quarter. We illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management, ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy\nstood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders. In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected US recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns, and we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model. A relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes,\nthe discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said: a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024. For the year we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to\nits highest and best use with high teen IRRs and mid single digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases. And we continue to generate strong recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success. Our diversified portfolio of market leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come, backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow. I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for\nshareholders and other stakeholders and to deliver financial security to our customers. As we have for over a century and a half. Now turning to our Q4 2023 results, last night we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates shifting to the full year 2023. The differentiation and scale across our market leading businesses were among the\nfactors that helped fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields. Our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year over year to almost $20 billion despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers climbed 6% with healthy growth across most business segments. Group benefits posted adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage.\nSales gained 9% while adjusted PFOs excluding the impact of participating policies rose roughly 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading retirement and income solutions business with new money yields exceeding roll off rates for the past seven consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong with more than $5 billion of longevity reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife's history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have\na strong pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Sales growth in Asia remains strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the next horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves\nand raised the bar on certain of our next horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14. Last year we chose to push that target even higher to 13% to 15. As you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3. While we have the strongest conviction in our next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success. When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger, our capital and cash is another prime example. During a year marked by periods of financial and\ngeopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets. Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly half a billion dollars of MetLife common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view\nduring 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion. We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our next Horizon Strategy continues to prove its mettle amid uncertainty.\nLooking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events, or the unfolding US election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be plain to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group benefits business, where off a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premiums, fees, and other revenues. Of further note, we've also increased our expectations for both group life and non-medical health\nmargins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well tested asset liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to defeat long term liabilities, and our historical track record has been very strong. In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate. But our unyielding execution against our\nstrategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control: balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency, and capital deployment, among others, in the final year of the Next Horizon Strategy time frame. We believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible four years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife, driven by\nthe continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the Q4 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions, as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the Q4 and full year 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the Q4 was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term\ninterest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter for the full year. The variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies, and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform\nas expected. On page four you can see the Q4 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment excluding $76 million after tax of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in Q4 of 2023 that was accounted for in corporate and other. There were no notable items in the prior year quarter regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million based on our latest review. While we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a\nconstant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income or VII volume growth, and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The group life mortality ratio was 83.5% favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90. Consistent with CDC US\nmortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in Q4. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the non-medical health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOS on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6. In addition, Group\nBenefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum. In voluntary RIS, adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads excluding VIII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps.\nRIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, and post-retirement benefits, as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in Q4, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on\nan amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, Asia sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid to high single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 2022. In addition, LATAM had favorable Chilean and CAJE returns of 7.9% in Q4 2023 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter.\nLatin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region for the full year. Adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, exceeding LATAM's 2023 guidance of low double digit growth. EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period as well as less favorable expense, and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year\nover year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis, and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior\nyear. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the true up of the federal tax return to provision. On page five this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the Q4, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially zero in the quarter.\nFor the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark to market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On page six, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior four quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RAS Asia and MetLife holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long dated liability profile. Now turning to page seven, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years as well as Q4 2022 versus Q4 2023.\nWhile VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023, was up approximately $2.6 billion year over year reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year over year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll off yield since Q4 2020. New money yields continue to outpace roll off yields over the past couple of years consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory, coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis\npoints higher than the roll off yield. Turning to page eight, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations, where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector. Broadly, the average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of 31 December 2023, up slightly from 63% in Q3 2023, and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3 times. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in\nthis asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong, with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to page nine, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in Q4 2023 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in group benefits as well as higher employee-related costs. That said, as we have\nhighlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2% below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at 31st December 2023, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion.\nThe cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock, dividend share repurchases of roughly $900 million in Q4, as well as holding company expenses, and other cash flows. In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the two-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range in terms of statutory capital for our US companies. Our combined 2023 NAIC RBC ratio is still preliminary but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target for our US companies.\nPreliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of 31 December 2023, up 10% from 30 September 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid.\nFinally, we expect that Japan's solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of 31 December, which will be based on statutory statements that we filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook starting on page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our Q3 2023 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business.\nNow let's turn to page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview, we expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the US dollar to stabilize around current levels based on the 123123 forward curve. We assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline, and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75\nof adjusted earnings. Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives, and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3. Specifically for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our corporate and other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 to 850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximate $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to 750 million in 2023. A higher range reflects CNO's current run rate. Given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs as well as the impact\nof lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 2 points to 24% to 26 to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the US. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual returns for\nprivate equity to be between 7% to 10, and we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7 over the near term. We expect PE in real estate returns will remain pressured in Q1 2024 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in vii. Now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the US on page 14 for group benefits excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023. Adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6 annually over the near term, and for 2024 we expect\ngrowth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products, as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term group life mortality ratio and non-medical health interest-adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89 and 69% to 74 respectively. Finally, keep in mind these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in Q1, given the seasonality of the business.\nFor RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4 expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RAS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the Appendix. Sensitivities reflect the\nanticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024. As such, our sensitivity to SOFR declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15 in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6 annually thereafter. We are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 to 900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the US on page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid single\ndigit growth over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year. We are maintaining mid single digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow higher by high single digits over the near term. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales to grow mid to high single digits and adjusted PFO to grow mid single digits over the near term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the US dollar relative to\nmost currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA's adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 to 65 million per quarter in 2024 and then grow by mid single digits in 2025 and 2026. Based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VIII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment.\nWhile the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation, and a diversified set of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, you may press 1, then 0. On your telephone keypad, you will hear acknowledgment that your line has been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue by repeating the same 10 command. Our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the ROE target. I recognize that you just raised the target by 100 basis points a year ago to 13 to 15, but it seems like your segment outlook would suggest something at least a bit above 15, maybe something closer to 15 and a half. So, I guess I just wanted to hear your perspective on. Am I thinking about that incorrectly, or is there some potential upside to this ROE based on the current trends you're seeing?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Ryan, it's John. I think, you know, we wouldn't debate your model calculations there. I think, you know, it's fair to say that. You know, we certainly are trending to the high end of that range, if not with a plus sign. But, you know, we just moved it a year ago, and I think we'll take a year here and take stock at that time. But I'd say, I think maybe just to help you with that, one other thing is, it's like I said, we'll take stock. We think over time, and we've been talking about this, that there has been kind of, as a result of higher rates, a shift in volume, and returns on our business. So it wouldn't preclude us from doing it again. We just, I think, want to take some time to take stock.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nUnderstood. Makes sense. And then I think you said that you expected the RBC ratio to be around 400%. Would have thought it would have been maybe a little higher than that, following the reinsurance transaction. Do you have any more color on if there were any offsets?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah, I think when we announced the deal, we thought this would give us, you know, 50 to 60 points. We still think it will. There's a little bit of, like, what happens immediately and then how things trend in over time. Also, there's a lot of other things going on. Fungibility growth. We had some very sizable growth in RAS, so we deployed some extra capital this year. You know, I think a lot of those things. But in terms of the deal economics that we outlined at time of signing, everything came in as expected.\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we go to the line of Sunit Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSunit Kamath\n\nStock Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah, thanks and appreciate all the color on the guidance, but maybe if we could just circle back to consolidated recurring NII, you know, I think you talked about a pretty big lift in 2023 relative to 2022, that $19.3 billion. Any help in terms of what you think that could look like given all of the moving pieces as we think about 2024?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nHey Sunit, it's John. It's a good question. I mean sometimes NII is. It's, you know, it's a helpful metric certainly from, I'd say mix and just to show that, you know, higher rates have more than offset or actually offset, you know, some of the depression of VII. And I think the point of that slide is to show that, you know, there's more power. Once things kind of reemerge on the VII front, sometimes it's a little hard with just translating NII to earnings. So we're a little cautious on always on necessarily giving a target around that because we have different products that perform well in different environments and ultimately the spread.\nAnd, so, I think we're a little hesitant to kind of forecast for you. I think the point of that slide was to indicate that it shows the growth in our business. It shows that we're well diversified, you know, we can perform well in a variety of economic environments. And I think that's really the. Probably the theme to take away. So, sorry, I didn't get to the. Maybe your exact question or answer, but that's probably the best I can do.\n\nSunit Kamath\n\nStock Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, got it. And then as we think about the benefit of the CAHPS in 2023 and what that looks like in 2024 as they roll off, should we think about the improvement in VIII as essentially like those two kind of net as a wash or is one kind of greater than the other? I just want to get some additional color on that if we could.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah, it's a great question. I think what you just said at the end around, you know, in terms of it, them being awash is a pretty good way of thinking about it. So, you know, we had 125 basis points last year all in for 2023. We gave a range of 115 to 140 for next year. I think the midpoint's, you know, a little above. It's at 127, I guess if you did the math. And our view is, yeah, there's. The interest rate caps will roll off throughout the year and then VII will emerge throughout the year and essentially, you know, you know, offset the decline there. And so we think the best way to think about the spreads for the year is relatively flat to what you saw for the full year of 2023. It will give and take here and there.\nYou know, as we point out on the slide, we think VII in the Q1 will continue to be pressured. Obviously, the caps haven't fully rolled off yet, so we'll still have income from them. And then as VII merges, you'll see the caps roll off and they'll essentially offset.\n\nSunit Kamath\n\nStock Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, that's helpful, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. So your assumed alternative returns are now around 7.5% for 2024. And I think the RBC risk charge, if I was to do a weighted average, would be 15% to 20 on most of that portfolio. Have you considered pivoting some of the portfolio into assets with comparable, let's say, 7% yields, like private credit or just other fixed income, but much lower risk charges? I'm just thinking about it from the perspective of we've had two years of underperformance. Your outlook for a third year is below those levels and rates are higher. And if I think about both your cost of capital and roe, I think it would be a fairly meaningful positive.\nNot recognizing you can't do this overnight, but is that something you consider pivoting or shifting to? Thanks.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Tom. It's John. I think the last point you made around you can't do this overnight is an important piece, but I think direction of travel, you know, that's probably fair point. And I think we've talked about. The fact that, you know, we are in a different rate environment, so the relative value of investments are probably different than where they were when it was lower for longer. You know, we're, we like, we pride ourselves in diversification. So it's, it's not that we would make an abrupt shift, but we do believe that, you know, making some tweaks to allocations is appropriate in different environments. And that would, I think what you're referencing is one that we would lean\ntowards. You know, we've had, you know, it's an asset class where you have prior commitments and, you know, those, you know, then get deployed judiciously. And actually, there are probably some really good opportunities right now that we're leveraging. Having said that, we think distributions will likely outpace new contributions just given our revised level of new commitments. And I think over time you would see, you know, a moderate shift in allocation in that asset class versus others.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, thanks. Then just a question on group benefits, the 100 basis points improvement in the margin target or at least the loss ratio targets. Can you comment on what's driving that? Is that stable pricing, sustainably higher disability, or lower disability loss ratios, and maybe a little bit on the group life side, what you're thinking.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nHead and Regional President of US Business, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Tom. It's Ramy here, and I would say at the highest level in terms of our near-term outlook, this is driven by the change in business mix, both in terms of the customer segments that we serve, as well as the products that we offer. From a customer perspective, we've executed well on our strategy to target higher growth in regional markets. We're seeing the benefits of that in terms of growth. Regional markets have grown 2% to 3 higher than the overall average, and we see a clear path for that growth to continue. Regional market is a segment that does carry a lower loss ratio across both the life underwriting ratio and non-medical health.\nWe're also seeing a shift from a product perspective. We've executed well on our employee paid strategy in general, and voluntary strategy in particular. In voluntary, we've seen double-digit growth over many years, and we expect that to persist in the future given customer needs and the opportunity to drive penetration in the workplace. The loss ratio here tends to be also more favorable to the overall portfolio. Between that customer segment and that product view, if you think about this over time, we feel kind of a shift to the outlook is warranted. Let me tell you what it's not been driven by. On the life ratio, this quarter was very favorable, and it's really driven, as John pointed out, to\nthe population mortality experience. This is not one quarter makes a trend, this is one quarter here that was favorable. We do expect the Q1 numbers to tick up given the seasonality of CLIFE claims. On the disability side, our outlook in terms of the ratios does include an expectation that the profitability of our disability line of business will moderate over time. That is outweighed by the other factors that I've just mentioned. Back to Q1 as well, just remember there's also seasonality in that ratio in Q1 given the seasonality of the dental business. Net net, think about it as business mix, customer, and product mix. That's really driving this shift downwards in the ranges.\n\nTom Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nFirst, a question on retirement spreads. Can you discuss the driver of the sequential decline in spreads each of the last two quarters, and how much of this is being driven by mix of business versus maybe competition? Because what we're seeing is your yields have gone up, but the crediting rates seem to be rising even faster than that.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Jimmy, it's John. The simple answer just sequentially for us is the lower rates late in the quarter caused a bit of compression on the spread number. Just how we had the caps were in the money and lower rates came in. It was different than the forward curve at the time of the Q3 when we gave the 135 to 140 range, came in at 134 XVI, so that's the main driver. It's not pricing. Pricing's actually been pretty healthy, relatively speaking. We haven't seen any. Change in pricing. If anything, it's really just a simple change in the curve.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOn the CRE portfolio, you mentioned resolving all of the maturities for 2023. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book is coming due over the next one to two years, especially in office properties? As you're resolving these loans, are you having to extend more of them than you've done in the past, or are you resolving them similar to how you would have done it over the last several years?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah, sure, Jimmy, it's John again. Just as a reminder for 2023, just rough, rough percentages of the resolution. About 30% was payoff or refinance. Another 60% was these contractual extensions where the. You know, the borrower has to be in good financial condition. We have some pretty high level of requirements there. Those are contractual. If you meet those requirements, then you have the right. They generally tend to be more floating rate nature loans where they're just waiting to lock in fixed rates. There's less than 10% on, I'll say, maturity extensions where we agree with the borrower. It's a good, you know, that there's a good positive situation for us to extend, and\nthen there's, you know, kind of a couple points of foreclosures. You know, in terms of 2024, about 10% of the balance comes due. In terms of maturities, the overall PBO that we have, I'd say that, you know, in terms of resolutions, probably a similar mix. What we saw in terms of percentage, and I think in terms of, you know, we gave a little bit of magnitude this past year in terms of what we thought were at risk loans and level of charge offs. Our view in 2024 is that we'd see a similar order of magnitude on both loans at risk and level of charge offs as well.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we go to the line of Elise Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nElise Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the PRT side. You know, I think we've stopped seeing, right, the seasonality where deals are, you know, much more weighted to the Q4. Just trying to get a sense of your outlook for 2024 and how we should think about, you know, the cadence of potential transactions there.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nHead and Regional President of US Business, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Elise, it's Ramy here. I think you're right to point out kind of the, we've seen less of that seasonality where we're seeing deals being done throughout the year. Our outlook there remains pretty positive. We continue to see a very healthy pipeline, in particular a pipeline at the larger end of the market where we are most competitive. You know, all the macro indicators in terms of what DB plan sponsors are saying in terms of the funding level, the magnitude of assets sitting in frozen defined benefit plan, all kind of indicate expectations of continued kind of high level of activity in this market into 2024. No change in terms of our view of the robustness of the\npipeline. Look, I mean, if you step back and look at RIS more broadly, the liability exposures are up 3% year-over-year, and most of that growth is coming from our spread earning general account business, which is actually growing at 4%. That's coming off. 2022, where we had the $8 billion PRT deal. That growth is not just PRT. PRT was about $5.3 billion but we are also seeing continued strength across a range of spread-based products, be they structured settlements, some of our products in our risk solutions business, and so on.\n\nElise Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. My second question, how should we think about dividends to parent that you guys could take in 2024 as you could look to upstream the capital that you guys are getting from the holdings transaction.\n\nMichel Khalaf\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah, hi Elise, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. We talked about the reinsurance transaction as providing us with significant financial flexibility. You know, as you heard from John, our RBC ratio is approximately 400%. You know, I would just note here that the $5.2 billion Holdco cash does not yet, not yet include any of the reinsurance proceeds. The excess capital is sitting in our statutory entities, and it will ultimately migrate to the Holdco. You know, we view excess capital as fungible, and we will redeploy it over time. In the absence of attractive organic or inorganic growth opportunities, I think we built a good track record in terms of being deliberate and expeditious post major\ndivestitures and how we return capital to shareholders. You know, as you've seen, since we closed on the transaction, we've leased and then to buybacks with, you know, especially in January. You know, I wouldn't sort of consider January as a, you know, monthly run rate for the full year. We're going to continue to be opportunistic here. Hope that helps.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nI would just add, Elise, I mean, just to kind of put a finer point on just the financial flexibility and the fungibility of that. I mean, you know, we might, you know, because we have excess capital at the Holdco, we might think differently at the Holdco. It'll depend. Right. I mean, I don't think we have to necessarily have it all at the Holdco. You know, we have a range of three to four. It might give us some ability to manage more, you know, differently in that, within that range because we have excess at the Holdco. I think we just want to, I think the flexibility is the key point.\n\nElise Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Scott with\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. First one I have for you is just going back to the VII guide quickly. Could you frame for us, you know. How much of the lower VII guide is maybe a little more specific to Q1 VII, and what you see in results that you sort of already have eyes on since it's lagged, as opposed to, you know, level setting like the ongoing expectation.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, Alex, it's John. I'd love to say that we have great insights into, you know, as a result of having the lag, but I'm not so sure that, you know, that has proven out the way we thought it, you know, would each quarter. I think all we know is that we think, you know, we kind of believe that it will bump along the. You know, kind of the bottom again before becoming a more meaningful contributor in the, you know, the outer quarters. You know, we think managers, even though the S&P jumped up in the quarter, it was kind of late in the quarter, you know, we believe managers will be a bit cautious in their year-end remarks, and maybe remain conservative before writing\ninvestments up based on some of the public market multiples. That's our, that's kind of our base case assumption. We don't have a lot of insight yet in actual financial statements that have come through. Obviously, those will come through as we move through the quarter.\n\nAlex Scott with\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe for a second one, just on what you saw around pricing in group benefits, maybe in the US and LATAM, around year-end enrollment and so forth. I mean, margins are really good. Are you seeing any competition that's starting to heat up there?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nHead and Regional President of US Business, MetLife\n\nThanks, Alex. It's Ramy here. I would say we're really off to a strong start in 2024. If you look at 2023, overall sales were up 9% year-over-year, as John mentioned. We saw very strong persistency in line with our expectations. We also saw the rate actions that we were able to take, also in line with our expectations across market segments. While there is competition and it is a competitive market, when we think about pricing as well as persistency, I think all the non-price factors of differentiation that we've talked about in the past are playing into our favor here. We've been able to hold margins, and as you've seen, we've expanded the margin outlook.\nOne to one, I can give you a bit of a flavor on that. We're still in the midst of it, but initial indications in terms of our sales growth are in the 5% to 10 again year-over-year, with really solid growth across the product portfolio, across both core and voluntary. These are really good indicators for us, both in terms of volume and margin, as we look into 2024.\n\nAlex Scott with\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Maybe sticking with group benefits, can you maybe talk about growth in employee count among your corporate partners, whether it's larger in the small or the jumbo, in maybe a viewpoint of one:one renewals with that. Thank you.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nHead and Regional President of US Business, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey John, I don't have that number handy specifically in terms of employee count. The best thing you could look at for indicator for that is just overall employment levels, because we have a very diversified book up and down market, is highly diversified by industry. You know, you could think of us as reflecting the broader economy in terms of our employee count. The one that I would look at more closely is, and this is where we see a lot of white space with respect to employee counts, the penetration rate in the workspace. We still see plenty of opportunity to drive penetration of our own products, be they voluntary or employee paid.\nThat's through the deployment of the right technology, the right tools, and the right engagement capabilities. That's really what's been fueling our voluntary growth over the past few years. That's where we see continued future growth opportunities.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you for that. My follow up question, you talked about the frequency of asbestos claims hasn't declined as expected. Can you maybe talk about that versus what the assumption was? Thank you.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning, John. It's John. As we said, you know, this is a, you know, something that we look at each third or Q4 where we conduct our experience study and, like, you know, this is a, this is an exposure where there is a declining claim count. What hasn't declined as expected or as fast as expected is some of the severe claims, so the larger claims. That's really what we trued up this quarter. Again, it's a kind of a runoff, you know, claim count exposure. You know, we've been seeing that for some time, but in the last 12 months we just saw a slightly different trend that we needed to adjust for. I mean, the overall reserves, you know, just above $350 million.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn the conference back to John Hall for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat, thank you, operator. Thank you everybody for joining us this morning. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Q3 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our Quarterly Financial Supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management.\nAlso, last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session. We will end Q&A just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Khalaf A\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the report we posted last night, MetLife delivered another quarter of strong underlying results with sustained business momentum. MetLife's capacity to perform across a wide range of economic scenarios bears testament to the resilience of our all-weather strategy and is characterized by our unyielding focus on execution.\nIn concentrating on those elements within our control, such as balance sheet security, investment performance, reserve adequacy, responsible growth, expense efficiency, and capital deployment, to name just a few, we have positioned MetLife to generate significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders for many years to come. Turning to the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $1.97 per share.\nNotable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of only $14 million, or $0.02 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% from a year ago. As we previously indicated, variable investment income of $179 million fell below our quarterly outlook expectation. Private equity returns totaled 1.4%, while real estate equity returns trailed at -3%. In the aggregate, net income for Q3 was $422 million, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period.\nThe Q3 result reflects the negative impact of certain required accounting adjustments associated with our previously announced reinsurance transaction. Net derivative losses related to interest rate and foreign exchange hedges held to protect our balance sheet further reduced net income. Our investment portfolio has stayed up in quality and continues to perform well.\nUnderscoring that quality, the credit metrics associated with our real estate portfolio remain largely unchanged sequentially, and we did not incur material credit losses during the Q3. Moving to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our US Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $483 million, an all-time high, and up 16% from a year ago. Underwriting results in the quarter for both Group Life and non-medical health were outstanding.\nYear-to-date sales are up 11%, while adjusted PFOs are up more than 4% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of par contracts and within our 4-6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year. In Group Benefits, we have invested significantly to integrate with the employer benefits ecosystem and enhance our enrollment capabilities and, perhaps more important, our re-enrollment capabilities.\nWith a significant portion of our overall sales in Group Benefits coming from employee-paid products, our efforts to enhance enrollment and take-up rates are critical. Speaking of enrollment, we are about to enter open enrollment season. This is an important opportunity to review employee benefit needs and refresh selections for the upcoming year, something I encourage all of you to do. Several of the investments that are referenced aim to make this process easier for participants. Further, we are activating emerging technologies that will help accelerate some of our Group Benefits initiatives, particularly around underwriting, claims, and the customer experience.\nWe believe the impact of these investments will enable us, over time, to further leverage our size to drive greater scale advantage.\nLooking to retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $409 million, up 60% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring interest margins, better variable investment income, and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer, with roughly $1.5 billion booked, as well as structured settlements and UK longevity reinsurance. We are poised to generate close to $3 billion or more of sales in each of these two high-return product categories for the full year.\nJust after the close of the Q3, we released our 2023 pension risk transfer poll, an example of our thought leadership in the space, which we have been publishing for the past eight years. The poll, which surveyed plan sponsors with de-risking goals, revealed several important observations relevant to the growth prospect for the PRT market.\nLet me offer some examples. Following record PRT sales in 2022, market activity is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Among companies who plan to de-risk, nine of 10 companies plan to completely divest all their defined benefit pension plan liabilities. And finally, 85% of plan sponsors expressed concern over missing an attractive window to secure an annuity buyout at competitive rates.\nThese findings confirm what I have said before: we should continue to see a strong pipeline for our pension risk transfer business. Now, shifting over to Asia, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $369 million were 23% above a year ago on better variable investment income. Sales in the region, on a constant currency basis, were up 5%, led by life insurance in Japan and Korea. For Latin America, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $199 million.\nFurther, Latin America posted healthy 16% gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs on a constant currency basis. Our digital initiatives don't stop at the US border. They extend around the world. For instance, in Latin America, we launched a digital platform that seamlessly integrates insurance solutions into the customer journeys of our LATAM business partners, such as banks, financial institutions, retailers, and others, which we expect will lead to even more responsible growth in the region over time. Expanding on the subject of responsible growth, in Q3, we released our value of new business, or VNB, statistics for the full year 2022, and the results are powerful.\nTo summarize, MetLife deployed roughly $3.7 billion of capital to support the origination of new business in 2022.\nThis capital was put to work at an average internal rate of return of 17%, with an expected payback period of approximately six years. The value of new business generated in 2022 is around $2.3 billion, which represents the net present value of distributable cash flows in excess of the hurdle rate. When we reference terms at MetLife like responsible growth and disciplined capital deployment, their application in our business is grounded in the systematic use of VNB.\nIt is hard to overestimate the positive impact this analytical tool has had in managing our business, starting with the deeply embedded practice of using IRRs and product pricing and ending with the establishment of business unit-level VNB goals and targets. Simply put, VNB guides our effort to target and prioritize capital-efficient and shorter payback business and measure our progress and success in doing so.\nOver time, we've sought to maintain the right balance of capital deployment across organic growth, acquisitions, and share repurchase to drive value for shareholders. While we bought back $11.1 billion of our shares and executed $2 billion of acquisitions from 2019 to 2022, we similarly deployed $13.5 billion to support responsible growth over the same period. Moving to quarterly capital and cash, MetLife remained active with capital management during the Q3.\nWe paid about $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased nearly $800 million of our common stock. In addition to our activity in the Q3, we repurchased roughly another $250 million of our common stock during the month of October. Year-to-date through October, we have repurchased about $2.5 billion of our common shares, and there is approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization.\nAt the end of the quarter, we held $4.9 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Before I close, let me provide a quick update on our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. At this juncture, we have received all necessary regulatory approvals, and we expect to close in short order.\nWe do not anticipate any material changes to the terms announced in May. In closing, we hosted a strategy session with our board of directors during the first week of October. This recurring annual meeting presents us with an opportunity to pressure test our strategy and to assess progress made toward our next horizon investor commitments.\nOn that front, we are on track to exceed each commitment made at our December 2019 Investor Day, and I am confident we will continue to deliver for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the Q3 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, including details of our annual global actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics, our liquidity and capital positions, as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in Q3. Net investment losses include the mark-to-market impact on securities that are expected to be transferred with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May.\nFor GAAP purposes, any increase in gross unrealized losses on these securities are required to be realized through net income until we close the transaction. Also, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment.\nIn addition, we had net derivative losses due to higher interest rates and strengthening of the US dollar versus multiple currencies, primarily the Chilean peso and yen. That said, net derivative losses were partially offset this quarter by market risk-benefit, or MRB remeasurement gains, due to higher interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well-positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and the hedging program performed as expected. The table on page four provides highlights of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business.\nOverall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was negligible. In group benefits, we had a favorable impact from assumption changes in individual disability, primarily due to lower incident rates and favorable recoveries.\nIn retirement and income solutions, or RIS, we lowered our near-term assumption for mortality improvement, which resulted in an economic benefit, given the longevity products in this business. In Asia, the net unfavorable impact was due to lapse rate changes across life and accident and health products in Japan, as well as lowering lapse rates and expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea. On page five, you can see the Q3 year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items associated with the annual assumption review and other insurance adjustments in both periods.\nAdjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, up 35%, and 33% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income, or VII, strong recurring interest margins, and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis.\nMoving to the businesses, starting with the US, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $483 million, up 16% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.6%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.7%, and below the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As a reminder, mortality results tend to be more favorable in the Q3, so we would expect our Group Life ratio to be back within the 85% to 90% range in the Q4 and full year of 2023.\nRegarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 69% in the quarter, or 70.4%, excluding the favorable impact related to the annual assumption review that I mentioned earlier, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%.\nTurning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 11% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products and markets. RIS adjusted earnings were $409 million, up 60% year-over-year.\nThe primary driver was favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income. Solid volume growth year-over-year also contributed to the strong performance. RIS investment spreads were 130 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII, were 138 basis points, up 26 points versus Q3 of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps.\nRIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 75%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, growth in UK longevity reinsurance, and post-retirement benefits. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.5 billion in Q3 2023, bringing our year-to-date total to roughly $3.5 billion. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $369 million, up 23% and 25% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins.\nAsia's key growth metrics were solid, as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as sales both grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across most of the region. In Japan, sales on a constant currency basis were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong life sales due to the ongoing momentum of a single premium FX life product that was relaunched 1 April 2023.\nIn other Asia, sales on a constant currency basis were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong life sales in Korea in advance of a prospective regulatory change that took place on 1 September that impacts low cash value whole life products. Looking ahead, while we anticipate Asia year-over-year sales will decline in the Q4, we expect full year 2023 sales growth to be at the top end or exceed our annual guidance range of mid to high single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $199 million, up 26% and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth and favorable underwriting margins.\nLatin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis, and sales were also up 16% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Mexico and Chile, and solid persistency across the region. AMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher volume growth, recurring interest margins, as well as underwriting margins running favorable to expectations. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year.\nAMEA adjusted PFOs were up 9% on both a reported, and constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings were $206 million, up 23%, primarily driven by higher variable investment income.\nCorporate and other adjusted loss was $262 million, compared to an adjusted loss of $258 million in the prior year quarter. Higher expenses, including interest on incremental debt, were partially offset by higher net investment income. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23% and within our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On page six, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior Q5, including $179 million in Q3 2023. The private equity portfolio of $14.9 billion had a +1.4% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a -3% return.\nAs of now, we anticipate PE returns to remain consistent with the second and third quarter, with a modest improvement in real estate funds in the Q4. Therefore, VII would more closely resemble second quarter results.\nOn page seven, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior Q5. As we have noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long-dated liability profile, while Corporate and Other continues to hold higher VII assets than historical levels. Now, turning to page eight, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q3 2022 versus Q3 2023.\nWhile VII has had lower-than-trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up approximately $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances.\nShifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory, coming in at 6.26%, 156 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue, assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to page nine, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans.\nFirst, let me say that we are pleased with the commercial mortgage loan, or CML, portfolio, which continues to perform as expected. As we have noted last quarter, our real estate team updated all US office valuations through 30 June, assuming a 25% peak-to-trough valuation decline.\nIn this quarter, the team shifted its effort to revaluing other CML asset classes, which have not been under the pressure seen in the office sector. Not surprisingly, the average LTV increased only slightly as a result, with our CML portfolio now at an average LTV of 63%, up from 62% in Q2 2023, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3x, which represents no change versus Q2 2023. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong, with only 1.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than 1x.\nWith regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved almost 90% of the portfolio scheduled to mature in 2023, and our expectation remains for minimal losses on the portfolio. Our CML portfolio scheduled maturities over the next three years are very manageable: 10% in 2024, 13% in 2025, and 16% in 2026. Now, let's switch gears to discuss expenses on page 10.\nThis chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2022, as well as the first Q3 of 2023. In Q3 of 2023, the ratio was 12.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline.\nWhile we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in Q4, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we are confident we will beat our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.6% in 2023, despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now, let's turn to page 11. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2022.\nAs mentioned by Michel, MetLife invested $3.7 billion of capital in 2022 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17%, with a payback period of six years, generating roughly $2.3 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 12.\nCash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at 30 September, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to 4 billion and higher than our $4.2 billion at 30 June. The cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, a $1 billion senior debt issuance in July, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the third quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $250 million in October.\nFor our US companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.1 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total US.\nStatutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of 30 September 2023, up 2% from 30 June 2023. This increase was primarily due to operating earnings, partially offset by dividends paid and net investment losses. Total US statutory adjusted capital has absorbed a negative impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic, which will be recovered upon closing. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 600% as of 30 September, which we based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\nLet me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher yield environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top-line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management.\nFinally, our strong value of new business metrics provide further evidence of our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use, consistent with our all-weather strategy. To close, MetLife remains in a position of strength, given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation, and diversification of our market-leading businesses, and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press 1, then 0 on your telephone keypad. You will hear acknowledgment that your line has been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from this queue by repeating the same 1, 0 command. One moment, please, for the first question.\nWe have a question from Ryan Kruger with KBW. Please go ahead. H\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, KBW\n\ney, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide some color on how January 1 renewals are shaping up so far in group benefits and also both in terms of persistency and the pricing dynamic in the market?\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of Us Business, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say we're still in the middle of the season. Recall the middle part of the market is still kind of active right now. But from everything we can see so far, we are doing extremely well here. Persistency in national accounts continues to be exceptionally high. We are seeing a tick up in the jumbo activity into next year as well, building on what we're doing this year.\nWith respect to our rate actions, we are getting the rates that the book needs in the market, and continue to see that both in terms of new business, as well as persistency.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, KBW\n\nThanks. Then in terms of capabilities within Group Benefits and M&A, you've done a couple of things to round out the portfolio. Is there anything else you'd be interested in at this point, or do you feel like you have what you need to grow organically?\n\nMichel Khalaf A\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Ryan. It's Michel. Yeah. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the capabilities that we've built with the transactions that we've done in the last few years in Group Benefits. I think they've been highly complementary, and we're very pleased in how they've performed. Think about our PetFirst acquisition, our Versant acquisition. And we continue to invest in this business.\nWe've said all along that this is a business where scale matters. To continue to meet customer expectations, you have to continue to make meaningful investments, something that we've done, and I think that's translating in terms of the momentum we're seeing, whether it's in variable benefits or in other areas. Whereas we don't see any gaps when it comes to our product set or our capabilities, we're always open to opportunities if we think those make strategic sense, if we think they can help us accelerate revenue growth.\nWhereas we see a path to continue to grow within the range that we've provided organically, if there was something that would help us accelerate that, that would make sense strategically, and that would make sense from a valuation perspective as well.\nWe look for the type of transactions that are accretive over time, that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We're always going to also compare any transaction to other potential uses of capital. At the end of the day, our focus pillar is about deploying capital to its highest and best use. So hopefully, this helps.\n\nRyan Krueger\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. A couple of questions on capital. The SMR in Japan seems kind of low at 600% now. Is that something to watch, or should we really be more focused on ESR since we're going to be pivoting to that new regime pretty soon? So that's the first question. The second is just the $1 billion increase in debt. Is that part of the permanent capital structure, or are you pre-funding a maturity there?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Tom. It's John. Thanks. So first question on SMR. Yeah, I think it's a balance when you start to look at these metrics. Obviously, we're looking forward at ESR. Higher rates are positive to ESR. So I think there's a transition happening in the market. We don't have any concerns with being at roughly 600% right now. Also, we have other tools if needed to the extent that rates would rise further. We have other internal reinsurance transactions we could do.\nAs of now, so no concerns from a capital perspective or dividend capacity perspective. What was your second question?\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThe billion-dollar debt increase.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. On debt. Yeah. So we issued the debt in July. That is not considered permanent capital. That is to pre-fund a maturity in Q1 of next year.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then just one other quick one.There's slightly improved real estate returns expected for alternatives in Q4. Is that because you have some property sales resuming and related gains, or is that just marks being stable?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. I think it's more the latter. I think it's just we've, in a way, it's trailing a little bit of what's happened in PE, where we had kind of the markdown, and then we've built you've kind of gotten to a trough. And as we've said before, we feel like we'll bump along the bottom here for a little bit on some of these fund-related returns for some time before we see kind of that U-shaped recovery. So it's more that.\n\nThomas Gallagher\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning. So first, I had a question on just retirement spreads.Should we assume that core spreads in the RIS business will maybe compress a little bit as you go through 2024 given expiration of caps, or are there other footprints?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nMorning, Jimmy. It's John. As you said, so good, strong core spreads this quarter, similar to last quarter. Just to help you guide to Q4, we think something in the same vicinity, maybe 135 to 40 is a good range to think about for Q4. And then, as you mentioned, over the course of 2024, we will have some expiration of some of the caps. As we've said before, this whole thing was constructed in a way for the caps to provide us time for the long rates to find their way into spreads and those things. You've seen that come through in a healthy way.\nSo we'll give some more guidance on that on the outlook call and provide some more detail as to how to think about 2024.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then on the CRE portfolio, the metrics almost seem deceptively too good and stable. But you mentioned you've resolved 88% of your 2023 maturities. Are you resolving them similar to how you would have done in the past in terms of either extending them yourself, or third-party financing, or stuff, or are there differences in how the maturities are being resolved now versus maybe a few years ago when things were much more stable in CRE?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. It's John again. Thanks. I take issue with your deceptive comments. But besides that, only kidding. But on the maturities, it's, roughly speaking, we've talked about these contractual extension options.\nThat's been about 60% of the maturities and how they've all had contractual right. It's if you're in good standing, you meet all the financial tests. They tend to be in the mid-50s LTV, so strong financial metrics. Almost 30% as well in terms of paid off or refinanced. And then the remainder is probably 10% of that is loan modifications, and then the remaining small single digits is the foreclosure or net payoff, which is, honestly, that level is somewhat similar to what we've seen in the past. So nothing out of the ordinary given the environment. So I think overall, roughly in line with historical, maybe the people on the contractual options, those are floating rate. They're tending to wait to see when they lock in their long-term rates.\nSo maybe there's been a little extra in terms of contractual extension options, but nothing out of the ordinary, I think, is the way to think about it.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAnd the remaining 12%, that's just a matter of time and you're going through stuff, or is there something unique about those properties, either by property location or otherwise?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. And the levels I gave you just now, they incorporate what we expect for the remaining 12%. So nothing unique or out of the ordinary. So I think the punchline we would share is everything's effectively in line with what we said in Q1 when we gave an outline of what our expectation was for the year.\n\nJimmy Bhullar\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. This first question on the value of new business slide.\nThe amount of capital that you've been deploying has sort of been $3.7 billion. It's pretty similar to what you did in 2018 and 2019. But given where interest rates are, are you seeing incremental opportunities to deploy more capital in the business? And then relatedly, should we expect that IRR of 17%, which I acknowledge is pretty healthy, does that have upside in this rate environment?\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Suneet. It's John. Good question. So just in terms of deployment of capital, remember last year, I mean, just one reason for that is we had the large IBM case that came through in Q3 of last year. But nonetheless, like you point out, very strong unlevered IRRs, strong payback periods. Very pleased with the results. We saw some great results actually in Japan as well. That's actually helping boost the VNB as well over the course of 2022.\nIn terms of IRRs, some of the things we've talked about is we do see, I think, broadly speaking, yes. I mean, we're starting to see demand for these annuity-type products to pick up. All right. So I think a volume aspect is emerging. I'd say it's still emerging in the institutional and retail space, broadly speaking. In terms of IRR and pricing, typically the rate environment will price in. The counterparties who are buying or selling, however you want to look at it, they're pricing in the current rate environment.\nSo I wouldn't expect a big uptick in IRRs. I think 17% IRR is a pretty healthy level to be at. But we'll see how things evolve.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just on capital, should we expect a pickup in sort of the pace of buyback once you close the Global Atlantic deal? Y\n\nMichel Khalaf A\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\neah. Hi, Suneet. It's Michel.\nSo really pleased with the fact that we've secured all regulatory approvals for the Global Atlantic transaction. As we had mentioned, we expect that to add about 60 points to our RBC, and we consider that to be excess capital. When we announced the transaction, we increased the authorization by $1 billion. And that was to signal the sustainability of our buyback activity. We also have a track record post-major divestitures of returning capital in a deliberate and expeditious manner.So I would suggest that we would conduct ourselves in the same manner here. Okay.\n\nSuneet Kamath\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is from Wes Carmichael with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nVP and Equity Research of Us Insurance, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. A follow-up on the group business. It seems like we're seeing pretty favorable results across the industry. Maybe not deceptively good, but definitely good.\nBut just wondering what your outlook is for the industry to retain better margins in that business, or if it's kind of given back over pricing in the next couple of years.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of Us Business, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Wes. It's Ramy here. I mean, look, I think a couple of points to note here. So one, of course, extremely pleased with our record quarter here, which is, by the way, a record even if you exclude the notable in the quarter. In general, what we tend to see in our results is there's seasonality. And while the dynamics are different by product line, in aggregate, Q3 tends to be the most favorable over the course of the year. If I think for us specifically on a go-forward basis, you should think about the mortality ratio, which is below the guidance for this quarter.\nThink about that coming back in Q4 to be within line for our guidance range. The other one I would perhaps talk about here is disability. I mean, disability continues to perform really well, both with respect to incidents and recovery levels. Some of this favorability is stemming from a favorable macro environment. And we believe that favorability will, over time, it's not going to happen in any given quarter, but will over time come back into pricing.\nBut having said that, and I'll refer back to kind of Michel's comments on having real focus and strategic intent here in terms of how we're investing in this business, the favorability we're seeing in disability is coming from solid underwriting, return to health capabilities, deployment of data, technology, predictive analytics in how we're running this business, in particular investments we're also making in the leave and absence space.\nThose are resonating really well in the market, and we believe over time will allow us to fuel further growth and maintain pretty robust margins here. Those are not going away. Those are differentiating capabilities that we have and distinct competitive advantages that we will maintain and continue to invest in.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nVP and Equity Research of Us Insurance, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Ramy. Maybe sticking with the US on the pension risk transfer market, it seems like maybe the market for full plan terminations has been heating up a little bit. I'm just wondering if you're willing to participate in those deals and also what the pipeline looks like as Q4 has been pretty busy historically.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of Us Business, MetLife\n\nThanks. We're pretty pleased with our performance this quarter. Year to date, we've had $3.5 billion worth of sales. We've also added another $600 million of premium so far in Q4.\nAnd we see a very healthy pipeline ahead and really with a lot of visibility into 2024, in particular in that jumbo end of the market, which is where we focus and where we have distinct competitive advantages. Our focus so far has been on the immediate retiree-only part of the market, and we see significant pipeline there, and we're able to win business at healthy IRRs. But we always continuously evaluate opportunities here. And as we've always stated, it's value over volume here. And so if we see opportunities with the right IRRs, the right returns, and the right risk profile, we're always going to be looking to evaluate those as we go forward.\n\nWes Carmichael\n\nVP and Equity Research of Us Insurance, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Insurance, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. First, what I had for you on LatAm, we continue to see good growth there.\nI think in the comments, you mentioned some of the digital initiatives and things like that. But I wanted to see if you could extrapolate further just on the sustainability of the really robust growth that you've seen in PFOs and how we should think about that business going into 2024.\n\nEric Clurfain\n\nRegional President of Latin America, MetLife\n\nYes. Hi, Alex. Thanks for the question. This is Eric. So we're overall very pleased with our results for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings in the $200 million range. The quarter's results are primarily driven by volume growth, favorable underwriting, as well as foreign currency tailwinds, which were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. On the top-line side, the positive trajectory continues, as you mentioned, with solid double-digit growth consistent with our expectations. We're seeing growth across the region in both our retail and group business.\nWe've been very deliberate in expanding beyond our core avenues of growth, developing third-party distribution channels such as banks, financial institutions, retailers, and others. And we've made significant technology-related investments in that space. And a good example is what you referred to that Michel mentioned in his opening around the launch of our new integrated platform, which provides embedded insurance capabilities for our distribution partners and thus creating a differentiating competitive advantage for us across the region.\nSo all these factors combined with our disciplined underwriting, pricing, as well as efficiency focus, are contributing to the solid earnings performance and sustained momentum.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Insurance, Goldman Sachs\n\nVery helpful. And then second question was on net investment income. Wanted to see if you could help us just with the benefits of higher interest rates and what it means really for net investment income trajectory more broadly across the organization.\nAnd then also interested if there's any tactical things you can do, anything you're doing allocation-wise that we should consider related to net investment income.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nGood morning, Alex. It's John. So a couple of things to point to for your question. We've given some sensitivities to interest rate movements in the past, and I think those are still fair approach to thinking about the impact, generally driven by the benefits of roll-off and reinvest. And you're seeing that on the slides we shared. So that has an incremental benefit. Obviously, we've also done a lot to reduce our interest rate sensitivity over the years. So it's not a hockey stick per se, but there's inertia there as you look at some of those sensitivities.\nI don't know if I have a number to give because gross numbers maybe get lost, but those sensitivities are more from an earnings perspective, and those are probably pretty good things to follow and think through as you kind of model out earnings growth. In terms of tactical, I think there's always tactical asset allocations that occur. We have a view of relative values that we take into account. But certainly, as rates grow, fixed-oriented products kind of grow in relative value.\nAnd we're seeing some unique opportunities out there. It's very helpful to have a wide breadth of product and expertise to work through the opportunities that are in the space. And that's scale. That scale is a big benefit. So we're excited for the opportunities that are out there. And having said that, we've been maintaining an up-and-quality mentality when it comes to investments.\nAnd with these rates, it's worked pretty well.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Insurance, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Good morning.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Question about the value of new business slide that's updated, not around the IRRs, but can you talk about how high rates and your outlook for that volume to possibly increase along with the value of new business? Thank you.\n\nJohn McCallion\n\nCFO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hey, John. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of ways to think through that, as I mentioned in the earlier comment. I mean, we are seeing an increase in demand, and that is, we've been able to solve that fairly efficiently with just annual capital generation. But we do think that it is going to grow, and we are constantly considering different ways to take advantage of that.\nI think eventually, and maybe a little bit to an earlier question, as volume and demand grows, that could improve pricing to some degree. Right now, I think it's fairly consistent and adjusts with interest rates. But there are dynamics between volume and how that can also improve value, but that will take some time.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you very much. And my follow-up question, I know we're in the thick of renewal season for group benefits, but some retailers have started to comment about the impact from GLP-1 or obesity treatments. Is that something that's come up within the renewal conversation at all? Just wanted to ask that. Thank you.\n\nRamy Tadros\n\nPresident of Us Business, MetLife\n\nYeah. It's Ramy here, John. We're not really seeing any of those having any kind of material effect on our book of business. And remember, we're not in the major medical. We're not providing Rx.\nWe are group life players, and none of that is really having any material impact at this point.\n\nJohn Barnidge\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is from Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could comment on the trends in Asia. It seems like the economy in Japan, at least, is re-engaging or reopening. So any thoughts on maybe the near-term outlooks there?\nHey, Mike. It's Lyndon here. So just as we look at broadly Asia, I'll just comment on sales, and then maybe we can get into Japan more specifically. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter, and year-over-year sales continue to be very strong. We've seen a 5% growth overall, and in Japan, 3%. In Asia, in total, we've been up 8%, and that's driven broadly between Korea and China.\nIf we look at the economy in Japan, it is really strong, but our sales are primarily driven by interest rates. And so the stronger interest rates have really helped us. So as long as that continues, we think we've got a really solid platform on which to leverage the higher sales.\nThanks. And then maybe just could you guys maybe speak to your appetite specifically for inorganic growth in the US around voluntary benefits? That'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nMichel Khalaf A\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nYeah. Hi, Mike. It's Michel. So as I mentioned earlier, whereas we don't see any gaps when it comes to our group benefits business here, we've been growing voluntary in the high teens for a number of years. The employee-paid component of our sales is also growing.\nWe're always open to do something inorganically if we feel that it fits strategically, if it adds a capability, if it helps us accelerate revenue growth, provided it is accretive over time and provided it also compares favorably to other potential uses of capital. So whereas there are no gaps, we have M&A as a strategic capability here and will deploy it if we believe it makes sense to do so and if it's a better use of capital compared to other potential uses.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, Michel. Maybe just one follow-up on that. Is case size something that makes you consider or not consider M&A and group overall?\n\nMichel Khalaf A\n\nPresident and CEO, MetLife\n\nMeaning, Mike, you're referring to sort of deal size?\n\nMichael Ward\n\nFinancial Analyst, Citi\n\nNo, sorry. The target market employer size. Oh. I mean, not really. I mean, I would say we have scale across our businesses and across markets.It's more around does 1 plus 1 equal more than 2, if you like, in terms of what we have and what we are potentially acquiring.\nOkay.Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we will turn the conference back to John Hall.\n\nJohn Hall\n\nGlobal Head of Investor Relations, MetLife\n\nGreat. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on this very busy morning for insurance earnings. And have a nice day. Thank you.\n\nOperator",

Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Arthur Hall\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings and Near-Term Outlook Call.\nBefore we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nOn the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management.\nLast night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will promptly end at the top of the hour. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Abbas Khalaf\n\nCEO, President & Director, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I look back on 2022, I am pleased with the relevance of our Next Horizon strategy and how it positioned us to absorb the challenges presented in the year and to succeed going forward. 2022 was a year still affected by COVID, and we incurred an impact of more than $650 million pretax. For the year, we saw pretax variable investment income, come in 19% lower than our outlook expectation on lower returns in our private equity portfolio. And from a macroeconomic perspective, we felt pressure from rising inflation, a falling equity market and a stronger dollar.\nYet despite these hurdles, MetLife performed. Our strategy proved its resilience and our consistent execution driven by discipline and determination paid off in 2022. We delivered an adjusted return on equity of 12.3% for the year, meeting our target for this important metric. We pushed ourselves, driven by our efficiency mindset, and succeeded in posting a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. Our strong 2022 free cash flow generation enabled us to hit our 2-year free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75%. This fueled the return of $4.9 billion of cash to our shareholders.\nAnd finally, we ended the year with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, arming us with ample financial flexibility. With our great set of market-leading businesses, good growth prospects around the world and the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow generation, I believe MetLife is very well positioned for the future.\nWhen we established our Next Horizon strategy at the end of 2019, we made several 5-year commitments against which we measure ourselves and more importantly, hold ourselves accountable. I am pleased with our success to date in meeting those commitments. Even more, I am confident that we will beat each one.\nWe committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Today, we are boosting our target adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This reflects, in part, our growth combined with our sustained discipline in pricing our products and in managing our capital. We said, we would generate $20 billion over 5 years of free cash flow. We expect to exceed this target. We committed to freeing up an additional $1 billion over a 5-year period to invest in growth and innovation. Again, we are on track to overachieve against this target, and we are reaping the benefit of these investments.\nWhen we made these commitments, we did not expect U.S. interest rates to approach the lowest level in history. These are did we contemplate a global pandemic? While the environment may change, our accountability does not. We are also not content to maintain the status quo. We seek to challenge ourselves and push for more to raise the bar.\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share, which compares to $1.8 billion or $2.17 per share a year ago. We generated strong underwriting results as COVID losses retreated further, while our recurring investment income continues to grow on higher new money rates. This was offset by variable investment income falling below our quarterly outlook expectation, and a stronger dollar.\nShifting to the full year 2022. The diversification of MetLife's portfolio of market-leading businesses once again proved its value. Most of our businesses and segments have returned to underlying levels of earnings equal to or greater than prior to the pandemic. Our U.S. Group Benefits business is a clear leader in this attractive segment of the life insurance industry. During the year, we grew our Group Benefits PFOs roughly 5% on top of double-digit growth the year prior. Our growth in Group Benefits represents more than $1 billion of new PFOs, bringing full year Group Benefit PFOs to approximately $23 billion.\nThese numbers matter. First, we bring the broader set of products to our customers, life, dental, disability, vision, A&H, legal and pet insurance among many others, more than any other carrier. Second, Group Benefits is a business where you have to make significant investments to keep up with evolving customer and employer expectations. Our scale enables us to make those investments, to add products and capabilities, and to further digitize and enhance the customer experience. All of this adds up to drive the growth and persistency we've achieved in our Group Benefits business over the last several years, as well as the growth we expect to achieve in the future.\nMoving to highlights from other segments and businesses. Our Retirement and Income Solutions business produced its strongest year of pension risk transfer volume in our history, more than $12 billion, including our largest ever single deal. Our Asia segment continued to generate strong sales growth, topping 11% on a constant currency basis in a market that remained in COVID's grip for much of the year. And our Latin America segment enjoyed both strong top and bottom line results, particularly in Mexico, as a heightened awareness of the importance of the products we offer, coupled with a flight to quality, drove sales up 26% on a constant currency basis, pushed persistency higher and added to adjusted earnings.\nMoving to capital and cash. MetLife is well capitalized and has plenty of liquidity, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our U.S. and international insurance businesses are self-funding. Our strong capital and liquidity position allows us to meet our commitments and obligations, but also equips us with the financial flexibility to seize attractive opportunities that may present an unsettled environment.\nWe have built a clear track record in terms of how we deploy capital to its highest use. If we have opportunities to put capital to work organically or via mergers and acquisitions at appropriate risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will do so. Case in point, we deployed approximately $3.8 billion of capital to support organic new business in 2022. Absent such opportunities, we will return capital to shareholders.\nIn 2022, we paid to MetLife shareholders $1.6 billion of common stock dividends, and we repurchased $3.3 billion of common stock. In January, we purchased roughly an additional $250 million of common stock, and we have around $900 million remaining on our current authorization.\nBefore I close, I would like to take a moment to recognize a true visionary in the history of MetLife. Harry Cayman, MetLife's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998, passed away on December 20, at the age of 89. Harry spent nearly his entire career at MetLife, starting as a junior attorney. As Chairman and CEO, Harry infused MetLife with a new corporate vision and an emphasis on profitable growth, something very much in line with our current focus on responsible growth. Harry's passing reminds us of the debt we owe at MetLife to those that went before us and building this great company since its founding in 1868.\nIn closing, our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its resilience in a changing and shifting environment. Our total shareholder return of more than 19% in 2022 underscores the significant value we created for our shareholders against this backdrop.\nAs we look ahead, our work is not done. We are raising the bar and setting our standards higher. As much as we have accomplished in recent years, I believe there is still much ahead for us to achieve. As the world has opened up, I was able to spend more time on the road than the last half of 2022 since the start of the pandemic. I'm more invigorated than ever to get out and meet face-to-face with our customers, our distribution partners, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to updating some, and introducing others to what we're building up MetLife, a company capable of being a quality compounder across a range of economic cycles.\nNow I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\n\nJohn Dennis McCallion\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook.\nStarting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in 4Q of '22 was $1.3 billion or $88 million higher than adjusted earnings. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses on the fixed maturity portfolio due to normal trading activity in a rising rate environment.\nCredit losses in the portfolio remain modest. In addition, we had net derivative gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher interest rates in 2022. Overall, our hedging program continues to perform as expected.\nOn Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. Excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate & Other.\nAdjusted earnings in 4Q of '22 were $1.2 billion, down 28% and down 26% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while higher recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, down 23% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis.\nMoving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million versus $20 million in 4Q of '21, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims, as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year.\nGroup Life mortality ratio was 87.6% in the fourth quarter of '22, in the middle of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69.4% in Q4 of '22, slightly below its annual target range of 70% to 75% and below the prior year quarter of 74.2%. The nonmedical health ratio benefited from favorable disability severity, while dental was in line with expectations.\nTurning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were essentially flat year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q4 '21 versus Q4 of '22 resulted in year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 6 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 6% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary.\nFor the full year, Group Benefits adjusted PFO growth was 3%, while underlying growth, excluding excess premiums from participating contracts in 2021 versus 2022, was up 5% and within the 2022 target range of 4% to 6%.\nRetirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 40% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower variable investment income, mostly due to weaker private equity returns. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year.\nRIS investment spreads were 96 basis points and 112 basis points excluding VII, up 21 basis points versus Q4 of '21 and up 11 basis points sequentially. Primarily due to income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income.\nThat said, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 23% in 2022. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. In addition, we had a record sales quarter for structured settlements, demonstrating the strength of product diversification within RIS.\nWith regards to PRT, we completed 6 transactions worth $12.2 billion in 2022, a record year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market.\nMoving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 63% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. In addition, we had a write-down of a deferred tax asset in China, as it was determined that the accumulated tax losses were unlikely to be utilized within the required 5-year statutory period. The write-down of the DTA reduced Asia's adjusted earnings in Q4 of 2022 by $34 million after tax and was accounted for in net investment income due to the equity method of accounting treatment for our China joint venture.\nWhile Asia's underwriting was modestly unfavorable versus Q4 of '21, we saw a significant sequential improvement due to lower COVID claims in Japan. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. And sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by FX annuities sold through face-to-face channels in Japan. For the full year, Asia sales were up 11%, exceeding its 2022 guidance of mid- to high-single digits.\nLatin America adjusted earnings were $181 million, up 45% and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. In addition, the Chilean encaje, which had a positive 6% return in 4Q '22 versus 4% in the prior year and higher recurring interest margins, were positive contributors. These 2 favorable items were partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year.\nLatAm's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs are up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.\nEMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 67% and up 112% on a constant currency basis. Primarily driven by favorable underwriting versus Q4 of '21, which had elevated COVID-19-related claims, particularly in the U.K. This was partially offset by less favorable expenses year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth across the region.\nMetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $208 million, down 57%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. In addition, less favorable expense margins and adverse equity market performance also reduced adjusted earnings year-over-year.\nCorporate & Other adjusted loss was $219 million versus an adjusted loss of $177 million in the prior year, which excludes favorable notable tax items of $140 million. Higher taxes and lower net investment income were partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year.\nThe company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding these favorable items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 22%, within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%.\nOn Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2022. VII was $24 million in the fourth quarter. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the bulk of the VII asset balances, had a negative 0.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag.\nFor the full year, VII was $1.5 billion, below our 2022 target range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our private equity portfolio had a positive 7% return in 2022, a solid performance in comparison to the public equity markets, with the S&P 500 down 19%. While VII underperformed in 4Q '22, our new money rate increased to 5.66%, which was 150 basis points above our roll-off yield of 4.16%.\nOn Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the 4 quarters and full year 2022. On a full year basis, you will note RIS MetLife Holdings in Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income, consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.\nTurning to Page 7. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 8 quarters and full year 2021 and 2022. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '22 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and timing of certain projects. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results.\nFor the full year of 2022, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our annual target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment, while continuing to make investments in our businesses.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.2 billion at September 30, and remained above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.\nFor the 2-year period, 2021 to 2022, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 68% and was within our 65% to 75% target range.\nIn terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2022 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2022 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $2.6 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3% sequentially, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings and investment gains.\nFinally, while our Japan solvency margin ratio dipped below 500% as of September 30, we expect the Japan SMR to be approximately 700% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. As we have discussed on prior calls, our Japan business as well as MetLife overall does better economically in a higher interest rate environment. However, given the asymmetrical nature of how the SMR is calculated, the ratio declines in a rising rate environment as assets are mark-to-market, but not the corresponding liabilities.\nAs a result, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction in December with our Bermuda entity, which has an economic-based solvency regime. This transaction improved the Japan SMR ratio by approximately 250 percentage points.\nBefore I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 9, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 15 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2017 through 2021. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '22 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 16 through 19, provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business.\nTurning back to Page 9, our 2023 to 2025 outlook reflects the impacts of the new accounting requirements of long-duration targeted improvement or LDTI. While 2022 actually used for growth rate calculations remain as previously reported on a pre-LDTI basis. In mid-April or roughly 2 to 3 weeks prior to the reporting of our 1Q '23 earnings, we plan to provide you with a recasted QFS, based on LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. While there would be certain positive and negative effects depending on product and segment. We do not expect the underlying run rate of adjusted earnings for the firm overall to change materially.\nNow let's turn to Page 10 for further details on our near-term outlook. We assume COVID-19 to be endemic. Consistent with the recent trends that we have been experiencing. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and a potential recession in 2023. Based on the 12/31/22 forward curve, we expect interest rates to rise in 2023.\nFinally, for purposes of the near-term outlook, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our long-term historical returns for PE.\nMoving to near-term targets. We are increasing our adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This increase of 100 basis points from our prior 12% to 14% ROE range is a function of the growing impact of our mix of business and higher new business returns over the last several years as well as the impact of LDTI.\nWe expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items. Our direct expense ratio guidance for 2023 is being recalibrated to reflect LDTI, by approximately 30 basis points to 12.6%. This captures an approximate $1 billion reduction in adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, due to the change in accounting. This is primarily related to certain annuity contracts within RIS as well as shifting certain variable annuity fees to market risk benefits, which are reported outside adjusted earnings.\nSince this change in accounting to LDTI will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of 2021. Our previously reported direct expense ratios will likewise be recalibrated to put 2021 and 2022, on the same basis as 2023 and beyond.\nOur VII for 2023 is expected to be approximately $2 billion after applying our historical average returns on asset balances. I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment.\nOur Corporate & Other adjusted loss target is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax in 2023. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 1 point to 22% to 24% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S.\nAt the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term.\nOn Page 11, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $14.7 billion in 2021 to $19 billion expected in 2023. Private equities will continue to hold the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE annual return of 12%, we expect an annual 7% return for real estate and other funds. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII.\nSo now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 12. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $750 million in 2022, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually.\nRegarding underwriting, we expect the Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. We are also maintaining the expected group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. Keep in mind, these are annual ratios, and are typically higher in the first quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health, given the seasonality of the business.\nFor RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. We are increasing the range of our expected annual RIS investment spread by 40 basis points to 135 to 160 basis points in 2023.\nThe majority of this increase is driven by continued expectations of rising interest rates on the short end of the curve, and the resulting benefit of interest rate cap income. Which we expect to peak in the first half of 2023. In addition, LDTI will contribute approximately 10 basis points to the investment spread calculation while not increasing adjusted earnings. Upon transition to LDTI, the unlocking of future cash flow assumptions to current best estimate, increased our deferred profit liability, which is amortized into earnings and will now be included in the spread calculation, reducing other sources of earnings. Overall, the conversion to LDTI will not significantly change RIS run rate adjusted earnings.\nFor MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline 12% to 14% in 2023, driven by the normal runoff of the business, market declines and the transition to LDTI. Beyond 2023, we expect annual PFOs to decline 6% to 8%.\nWe are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio target to 40% to 45% in 2023 from the prior 45% to 50% target, to reflect the impact of lowering policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2023.\nNow let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 13. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid- to high-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia's adjusted earnings, excluding $270 million of COVID-19 claims in 2022, to grow at mid-single digits over the near term.\nFor Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by low double digits over the near term. We expect our adjusted earnings to grow high single digits over the near term, excluding roughly $80 million due to favorable market-related factors in 2022.\nFinally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-to-high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. We expect EMEA run rate adjusted earnings to be roughly $55 million per quarter in 2023, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds and then grow by high single digits in 2024 and 2025.\nLet me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a good quarter to close out another strong year. Reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth, positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.",

Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Arthur Hall\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. To begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nPresenting on the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also available to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, and it will end no later than the top of the hour.\n(Operator Instructions)\nNow on to Michel.\n\nMichel Abbas Khalaf\n\nCEO, President & Director, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more, and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy, which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty.\nLooking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA, which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management.\nTurning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant-rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings.\nExcluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter.\nAs you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market, which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500. Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy, but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates.\nFor roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife.\nShifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86%, which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%.\nExecution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well, and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off.\nIn Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million, which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower-variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest-ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife. And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years.\nFor Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower-variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules, which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant-currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products.\n2 weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage.\nIn Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant-currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum.\nMetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal choose of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife.\nThe discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIM's ESG capabilities with MIM's fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife.\nMoving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion.\nIn closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future.\nWith that, I will turn things over to John.\n\nJohn Dennis McCallion\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset-liability-management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected.\nIn addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings.\nThe table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in Life as a result of higher-earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain, which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean-reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions.\nOn Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant-currency basis. Lower-variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant-currency basis.\nMoving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix.\nRegarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter.\nTurning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating Life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary.\nRetirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable items this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.\nWith regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date, and we continue to see an active market.\nMoving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notable items were down 73% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, primarily due to lower-variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products, which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels.\nLatin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower-variable investment income and the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico.\nEMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant-currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21, which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting growth across the region.\nMetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower-variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset.\nCorporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower-variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23%, which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%.\nOn Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71%, which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment.\nOn Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable-investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.\nTurning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.\nNow let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest-value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30, which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July.\nIn regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower-variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date.\nFinally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business.\nLet me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.",

Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to the risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Arthur Hall\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nOn the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.\nAn appendix to these slides feature incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now over to Michel.\n\nMichel Abbas Khalaf\n\nCEO, President & Director, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all-weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise.\nThe resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share.\nThe combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet.\nAlso, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period, MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class.\nIn the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter.\nThroughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins.\nTurning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million, were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year.\nGroup Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior falls down during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results.\nAt the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past, the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve.\nDuring the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting.\nCOVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by deemed hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis.\nIn Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year.\nLooking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively.\nMoving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half.\nThere remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion.\nFinancial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030.\nThe MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter.\nIn closing, when we introduced our Next Horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife. With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders.\nWith that, I will turn things over to John.\n\nJohn Dennis McCallion\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting, known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23.\nStarting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment.\nIn addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings.\nOn Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets.\nAdjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth.\nThe Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter.\nThe adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix.\nRegarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period.\nThe higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21.\nFavorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance.\nRIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.\nWith regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis.\nIn addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth.\nOverall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LATAM's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. LATAM's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter.\nLATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax.\nIn addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline.\nMetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors.\nThe company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter.\nAs we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss.\nWhile VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22.\nAsia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.\nTurning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline.\nWhile we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.\nIn addition, HoldCo cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income.\nWe estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates.\nNow shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI.\nThe changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation, the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a single [rate] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances.\nAs you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business.\nLet me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined.\nFinally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused, company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.",

With that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Abbas Khalaf\n\nCEO, President & Director, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022. With the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and a pandemic that hasn't fully lucent its script, these results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife's purpose of always with you, building a more confident future, is ringing through with our customers now more than ever.\nStarting with our financial results. We reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations.\nNet income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movements and impairments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings.\nInterest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter.\nLet's shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pretax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return with higher PE balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact our VII results in the second quarter.\nFor MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation generating strong returns and supporting our long-dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently.\nLast quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and a transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation while establishing a new fee-generating business venture.\nTurning to some first quarter business segment highlights. I'll start with our U.S. group benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment levels and higher salaries. Although COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%.\nOur flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders and every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business.\nWith our scale and leadership the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent, something we will simply not allow to happen. We've taken concrete actions to grow and established products like group life, dental and disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like Vision and PET. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last 3 years looking past claims.\nIn Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% and primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago.\nBeyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward.\nFor Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year, driven by a good fiscal year-end in Japan.\nIn Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period as COVID-19 claims moderated in Mexico. The exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which, in turn, has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency.\nShifting to capital and cash. We returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011.\nWith $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding company. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter.\nTurning to governance. MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors, and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well.\nOur talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global (technical difficulty), MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength.\nI want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Vice Strategy Officer; as Head of MetLife Auto and Home; and finally, as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy, Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head our Strategy for MetLife.\nThese moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to an accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion.\nAt the end of the quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions and other efforts and are firmly aligned with MetLife's purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear road maps and strengthening accountability for progress.\nBefore I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife's return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28. Our new model, future work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and understanding our talent. Our future work model has been well received in the U.S., and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization.\nWe are also well underway to adopting our future work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in person meetings and feed off the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team's enthusiasm and energy levels has been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face-to-face with many of you in the months ahead. The past 2 years has been an unprecedented period, but with all the challenges, MetLife is laser focused on consistent execution, and we look forward to building on our momentum.\nWith that, I will turn things over to John.\n\nJohn Dennis McCallion\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 1Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions.\nStarting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of a significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter.\nIn addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairment in Russian and Ukrainian bonds as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment.\nFollowing the impairment and the sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million.\nOn Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of '21.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $2.08 and down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis.\nMoving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly.\nRegarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of '22, at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1% due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter.\nTurning to top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary.\nGroup Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of '21, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q '22, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remains strong.\nRetirement and Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity return versus a very strong Q1 of '21. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 89 basis points up 1 basis point versus 1Q '21, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year as growth across most products, primarily U.K. longevity, reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances.\nWith regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market.\nMoving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and the decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales in Japan.\nLatin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remained elevated in 1Q '22 at roughly $30 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean encaje had a negative 4% return in 1Q '22 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive.\nWhile LatAm's bottom line has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region.\nEMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in first quarter of '21 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter.\nMetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting.\nCorporate & Other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of '22, to better align asset liability management for these 2 segments. Higher expenses were a partial offset.\nThe company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%.\nNow I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last 5 quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits' adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 103.8% in the first quarter of '22, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million.\nWhile U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these 2 competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter.\nIn addition, we experienced 1 to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a larger number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period to period.\nOn Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first quarter of '22. The strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter.\nUnlike previous quarters, where we have seen a dispersion on returns by fund type, this quarter, our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall.\nAs we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss.\nOn Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of '22. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q '22, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES as to Corporate & Other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia's higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance as well as higher PE asset balances.\nTurning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth, and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in group benefits due to excess mortality.\nWe remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.\nOur first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect holdco cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted.\nIn regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%.\nFor our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021.\nFinally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022 as a result of higher U.S. interest rates but remain well above its capital target level.\nLet me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company, will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.",

Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nJohn Arthur Hall\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings term outlook call.\nBefore we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\nOn the call this morning are Michel Hulot, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management.\nLast evening, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features outlook sensitivities disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will last no later than the top of the hour. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, over to Michel.\n\nMichel Abbas Khalaf\n\nCEO, President & Director, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography, allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, 1 of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3.\nIn the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal. Yet MetLife's diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9% with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress.\nMetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6%, and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amount ever posted by MetLife.\nWe believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife's purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company's purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic.\nOver the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot heal the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people's lives.\nFinally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continue to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage.\nDespite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise, that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success.\nMetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth's sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy.\nWe were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife's shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August.\nAs a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly.\nI would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one, provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it, and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete.\nAs our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% in the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels.\nAnd in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call.\nWe are steadfastly making good on our promises while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I'll close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique.\nWe have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain wedded to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife's success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged.\nThe next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge.\nNow I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\n\nJohn Dennis McCallion\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, MetLife, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings.\nNet derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings.\nOn Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management.\nMoving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of '21 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization.\nThat said, the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences.\nTurning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of '20 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary.\nRetirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q '20, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance.\nWith regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market.\nMoving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q '21 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially.\nIn addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean and Cage returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region.\nEMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19-related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $177 million, excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter.\nHigher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return.\nAdjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the 4 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%.\nCOVID reported claims in 4Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q.\nAs a result, these 2 competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2021.\nVII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter.\nOur venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion we're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.\nOn Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the 4 quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each.\nFor the full year, these 3 businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia.\nTurning to Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 8 quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '21 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and group benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.\nI will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.\nIn 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021.\nOur statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year.\nFavorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data.\nBefore I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2016 through 2020. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '21 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness.\nConsistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business.\nTurning back to Page 11. We expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE.\nMoving to near-term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024.\nThis is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment.\nOur Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term.\nNow I'd like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021. These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we've begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds.\nIn addition, our 2022 average VIII asset balance also factors in, our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds.\nSo now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted.\nLet's start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base.\nRegarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%, excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%.\nFor RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range.\nOverall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage paydowns and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID.\nFor MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually, higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels.\nFinally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid- to high single-digit growth over the near term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near term.\nRelative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022, excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024.\nFinally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits over the near term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect to me adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid- to high single digits on a constant currency basis. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities.\nIn addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.SPEAKER01",

My name is Rebecca, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EPAM Reports Results for Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Rowshandel\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. We hope you've had an opportunity to review our earnings release we issued earlier today. If you have not, copies are available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Balazs Fejes, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings.\nAdditionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I will now turn the call over to FB.\n\nBalazs Fejes\n\nPresident of Global Business & Chief Revenue Officer\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you on my very first earnings call as a CEO. And please just call me FB, be as Hungarian names are notoriously difficult to pronounce and why FB because in my native language feminine comes first. This quarterly call arrived faster than even my standard double espresso shot in the morning, and that's really the theme for the day. Things have been moving quickly since we spoke last, and today, we have positive news to share.\nOur third quarter results came in better than expected, marking other quarter a broad outperformance and strong delivery execution. We continue to benefit from AI and AI native led demand or thesis that data and modern cloud architecture are critical for adoption and oralization is broadly being confirmed by what we are seeing. Our clients are prioritizing their AI build-outs, turning to EPAM to help them accelerate their investments and innovation in AI. The unique combination of our deeply rooted engineering DNA and our globally recognized best-in-class AI-native expertise continues to differentiate our offerings and help us further expand wallet share within our existing client portfolio and targeted new logo segments.\nAt the same time, we are more focused than ever on upgrading our engineering skills advantage and investing for the future with new advanced AI playbooks and accelerators. Serving a client 0 for adoption, we believe innovation starts from inside, which is why in parallel, we continue to restlessly push our AI literacy and AI adoption rates.\nLooking at our progress year-to-date, more than 90% of EPAMers have completed their mandatory AI literacy education and approximately 95% of our engineers have completed foundational AI education. Additionally, our internal business processes are increasingly benefiting from AI-driven efficiencies. As you can see with the recent launch of EPAM AI Transform, which includes next-generation AI managed services, and EPAM agent in QA, we are programmatically expanding new offerings and highly specialized capabilities, often in conjunction with our clients and strategic partners, to help clients transform themselves into AI native organizations.\nOur efforts are being recognized by our partners as well as industry analysts such as IDC Marketscape who have positioned EPAM as a leader across experienced engineering, custom build and AI consultancy capabilities. Further, [ Glader ] ranked EPAM #7 on their 2025 best led companies list along Grid Forbes, who recognized EPAM as one of the world's best employers or first time being recognized across both. We will dive into the details a bit later in the call, but first, I would like to provide a quick update from my early days of CEO and my recently completed [ Vertu. ]\nOver the past quarter, I met in person with many senior client executives, ecosystem partners, and of course, many, many EPAMers from all around the world. I experienced firsthand the high level of optimism appetite for EPAM proven quality of execution across our global deeply specialized talent base. I am pleased with our continued and growing ability to ensure higher levels of performance across a much more globally diversified footprint than ever before. But our work is not done.\nAI presents a permanent fleet change in our industry and across our clients' businesses, driving the need for investment in modernization, data and cloud foundations and critical AI native skills. EPAM is positioned to lead both the foundational and the transformational programs demanded by AI as clients need support from trusted partners who can reliably deliver through the need to [indiscernible] balance costs and productivity with an increasing need to reinvest, innovate and keep pace with change.\nIn line with [ Amara's ] law, we believe that as the productivity growth and our cost to develop software declines, complexity will significantly accelerate pushing the bleeding edge and resulting the boundaries of what is possible. And triggering a flywheel effect of demand for EPAM's unique breed of capabilities and global scale. We believe that as complexity rises, so does enterprise risk, raising the importance of highly advanced engineering with proven enterprise-grade quality execution.\nWhile we have seen the flashy white coding video shorts and headlines in our view, the absolute need for true engineering expertise, risk management, full terrace and reliability are overlooked and underestimated.\nNow let's turn to some Q3 highlights. In Q3, we delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, including very strong year-over-year organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.1%, which exceeded our expectations set a quarter ago. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year organic constant currency growth, reflecting a steady build of improvement and strong execution in our core business as we continue to ramp our AI native services. Our broad-based growth momentum carried forward in Q3 with 5 out of 6 verticals growing year-over-year. Notable standouts included emerging verticals, financial services and software and high tech.\nWe also saw solid improvement in life sciences and health care, along with consumer goods, retail and travel while business information and media remains steady. Geographically, all 3 regions delivered strong year-over-year growth. We continue to add net organic headcount across key locations, such as India, Central Eastern Europe and South America. With increases partially offset by ongoing optimization in select pockets that we have discussed previously.\nNow turning to demand environment. AI continues to trigger incremental demand and is driving positives in our pipeline globally. The majority of our top 100 clients remains highly engaged in AI-native initiatives. Clients engage EPAM to build out their data platforms and modernize their cloud, often redirecting work from other partners who successfully sold advanced capability, but failed to deliver it.\nOverall, we continue to see improvement in the demand environment as we're seeing a continued upshift in investment towards everything that supports adoption and its deployment to production. This is where reputation for trusted quality and execution remains a significant competitive advantage and a key enabler for us to continue to maintain our pricing integrity.\nWe gained traction with our ongoing client-centric initiatives while at the same time, continuously strengthening and optimizing our global delivery footprint, which is enabling us to better meet market demand. When you look across the AI project life cycle from proof of concepts to medium-sized use cases and the large-scale project in production, we're seeing a continued shift in the volume of project towards medium- and large-sized projects. Many making use of our own IP, such as diode, AI run and other components, both open source and proprietary.\nOf the hundreds of individual AI-native projects, we had active in Q3 between 60% to 70% have expanded into larger programs from the origination of proof of concepts, illustrating our ability to scale and deliver AI native solutions in production. We are also seeing positive signs at the top of the funnel, enabling us to replenish our pipeline or some projects come to a natural clause.\nOur hard work and continuous effort to further position EPAM as a leader in AI native services is serving us well as our pure AI-native revenues continues to grow nicely with a third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. And of course, as we have discussed before, the foundational services necessary to meet AI work are a core fundamental to our business. In both our data and cloud practices, we saw outsized growth in Q3 compared to the rest of the business, which is incremental and highly connected to the momentum we are seeing with our pure AI native revenues.\nNow turning to our AI around transform and agentic QA announcements. First, a couple of core beliefs to frame our evolving AI approach. Number one, AI is not just a technology. It's a transformative force that is already redefining how enterprises innovate, operate and create value in the future. And in this context, advanced engineering, bleeding edge, AI technology and tool sets on with deep knowledge across the software development industry, a new product life cycle are the core competencies that will drive the most tangible AI outcomes. This will become even more evident as we see further rise of AI in the global and regional lineups of players in both Western market and Broadcast APAC, LatAm and Middle East.\nNumber two, we believe in the building AI responsibly, with trust, transparency, governance and measurement outcomes at the core. AI must deliver real outcomes with proper traceability and risk management.\nNumber three, we believe we are creating a new AI native engineering profile or North Star when it comes to talent development strategy, embedding AI intelligence and orchestration of agents directly into the development process. Over time, this role becomes the architect of AI native products and experiences augmented by agents to expand the scope of what teams can achieve in the future.\nAnd finally, AI investments are in interest rates. Our approach is to invest in accelerators, tooling and people who help us deliver reliable outcomes on the promise of -- we do not sell foundation AI in a silo. Instead, we use our expertise and advanced IP to sell and deliver with AI, a with proven quality and execution that guarantees outcome and volume realization. This is true across our entire IP portfolio and is shaping into a structural blueprint we are calling AI Run.\nAI Run transform represent our unified AI strategy that harmonizes our go-to-market motions with better activation across strategy and consulting, frameworks, and methodologies, talent and advanced tool sets. We have 2 key offerings: AI innovation business transformation and AI native engineering transformation.\nThe first offering is focused on optimized expand runs across AI Industry Solutions, AI horizontal solutions and AI product design and experience. The second offering is focused on mostering the DLC advancing the Agentic delivery life cycle known as ADLC and preparing for product development life cycle known as PDLC. This is nooses AI-native delivery, AI-driven modernization and PDLC agenetic solutions. We will be talking more about these offerings in the quarters to come.\nOur AI Run blueprints, encompasses or AI frameworks and include our AI 360 AI factory Iron SDLC and AI adoption and education frameworks, which are agnostic and provide critical flexibility, which help EPAM deliver more enterprise-grade AI solutions at scale for our clients. Our AI/Run talent, houses or verticalized industry teams, ontologies and accelerators, which includes strategic advisory, data models, process modeling and solution built with partners. Most importantly, this is the scaffolding we are using to define the forward skills of the future and the parts for upscaling people and organizations.\nAnd finally, our AI Run tools combines our best-in-breed IP assets, such as [indiscernible] and Iron platform with our strong AI, data and cloud ecosystem partner solutions and many available today on our partner marketplaces. You may have seen we also recently announced one of these tools, Agentic QA, which reset the gap between automated and manual testing, enabling clients to move faster by reducing lead times and costs.\nWhat's impressive is that our agentic QA is shown to be 10x more efficient than manual testing, driving a 50% reduction in manual efforts and a 30% reduction in testing costs covering 90% of the manual checks performed on standard releases while ensuring a high degree of quality and precision.\nNow turning to some client examples to illustrate some of our progress. This past quarter, we announced several collaborations with both new and existing clients which illustrate not only evolution of our client proposition, but also how EPAM is able to systematically address innovative needs while offering real volume. A few notable examples. Agentic customer service breakthroughs are real with [indiscernible], a major provider for telecommunications, cloud and Internet services in Germany.\nBy deploying EPAM's AI/Run transform Blueprint and leveraging Microsoft Azure, this client launched AI voice agents that handle over 100,000 calls weekly with the first agents going live under 3 months into production; two, our collaboration with Hugo Boss and our empathy lab studio is reimagining what means to be a sports fan in the age of spatial computing. This innovation is shaping the next generation of motorsport tendon lifting the bar how luxury fashion, sports and technology intersects.\nWe are blending our deep expertise in groundbreaking user experiences with gaming, funnel engagement, advanced data and analytics and working with our clients to help package the 2025 TV award-winning solution for the AI native age.\nThree, finally, we are putting EPAM and NEORIS together in a way that goes beyond simple synergies. For a U.K.-headquartered global biopharmaceutical company, EPAM, with the addition of NEORIS recently became a global strategic supplier across a broad range of transformation pillars. A key joint win for us is in helping the client to build out a modern data and a center of excellence, which spans across multiple programs and new locations, including Ibero-America.\nTo close our operating momentum is strong. We are pleased with our performance throughout the year and continue to work on improving profitability. We are confident in the upward trajectory we have been working hard to build and sustain over the past several quarters and feel good about our Q4 positioning, which has improved over the past 90 days.\nWe are focused on what's right in front of us and finishing 2025 strong, which we believe should set up a solid foundation to build upon in 2026 and as we continue to work on expanding our organic constant currency growth rate. we are prioritizing client-centric, disciplined execution while bringing a new level intentionality on building verticalized and differentiated horizontal go-to-market offerings.\nLooking ahead, we see our investments in upskilling differentiated AI playbooks, IP partnerships and new lines of services such as Agentic business process outsourcing, helping us to further capture new demand.\nJason, over to you.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, FB, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.394 billion a year-over-year increase of 19.4% on a reported basis, exceeding the high end of our Q3 revenue guidance. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 7.1% compared to the third quarter of 2024. We delivered another consecutive quarter of very solid year-over-year organic constant currency growth, reflecting ongoing steady execution.\nOur growth in the quarter was driven by a continued shift to quality and accelerating momentum across our AI native, data, cloud and AI foundational initiatives. We're making early headway with the launch of our AI run transform strategy, which complements our underlying growth momentum, positioning us well to continue to capture demand.\nOur outperformance in the quarter was broad-based. We also recently announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program. The underlying strength of our business and continued momentum coupled with our efficient free cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet enable us to take advantage of the current market dynamic while returning cash to shareholders.\nMoving to our Q3 vertical performance. Five of our 6 industry verticals posted year-over-year growth, with 4 of the 6 growing double digits. NEORIS and first derivatives continue to contribute substantially to our financial services and emerging verticals.\nFinancial Services once again delivered very strong growth, up 32.7% year-over-year on a reported basis, with 6% organic growth in constant currency. Growth came from banking, asset management, and insurance clients. Software and [ Hi-Tech ] grew 19.1% year-over-year, driven by strong execution and broad improvement across large clients. Life Sciences and Health care increased 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth in the vertical continues to be driven primarily by clients in life sciences and med tech.\nConsumer goods, retail and travel delivered 9.9% year-over-year growth, marking a notable rebound relative to prior quarters. The vertical also delivered solid sequential growth, which was driven by growth in consumer products and retail.\nBusiness Information & Media was steady and delivered flat year-over-year revenue performance. Our emerging verticals delivered another quarter of very strong year-over-year growth of 38.9% with New York continuing to contribute to the verticals performance. On an organic constant currency basis, growth was 15.1%, primarily driven by ongoing strength in energy and materials.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 58% of our Q3 revenues, grew 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and 3.9% in organic constant currency. EMEA comprising 40% of our Q3 revenues increased 24.9% year-over-year and 11.8% in organic constant currency.\nAnd finally, APAC making up 2% of our revenues increased 17.7% year-over-year and 14.2% in organic constant currency.\nLastly, in Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 10.2% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 24.4%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.5% compared to 34.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31% compared to 34.3% for the same period a year ago. As a reminder, the prior year period benefited from a cumulative catch-up related to the Poland R&D credit. The third quarter of 2025 includes a single quarter's benefit of $13.2 million.\nAdditionally, for Q3 2025, we recognized higher variable compensation driven by expected stronger second half performance. combined with ongoing lower profitability associated with recent acquisitions, both contributed to the lower gross margin level. GAAP SG&A was 16.8% of revenue compared to 17.7% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q3 2025 came in at 14.1% of revenue compared to 14% in the same period last year.\nGAAP income from operations was $145 million or 10.4% of revenue in the quarter compared to $177 million or 15.2% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $222.8 million or 16% of revenue in the quarter compared to $222.9 million or 19.1% of revenue in Q3 of the previous year. Non-GAAP income from operations in Q3 2024 was similarly impacted by the Polish R&D credit.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 25.6%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.1%. The Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.91. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.08 compared to $3.12 from Q3 of last year, reflecting a $0.04 decrease year-over-year. In Q3, there were approximately 55.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $295 million. compared to $242 million in the same quarter of 2024. Although seasonality always has a positive impact from Q3 cash flow, cash flow from operations in the quarter exceeded the impact of typical seasonality and resulting in the highest level of quarterly cash flow from operations in EPM's history.\nFree cash flow was $286 million compared to free cash flow of $237 million in the same quarter last year and also represented an all-time high. Cash and cash equivalents were just over $1.2 billion as of the end of the quarter. At the end of Q3, DSO was 75 days compared to 78 days for Q2 2025 and 74 days for the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the third quarter were approximately 493,000 shares for $82 million at an average price of $167 per share.\nMoving on to operational metrics. We ended Q3 with more than 6,100 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, reflecting total growth of 17.5% and organic growth of 6.4% compared to Q3 2024. In the quarter, we added approximately 300 net delivery professionals. Our total headcount at quarter end was 62,350 employees. Utilization was 76.5% compared to 76.4% in Q3 of last year and 78.1% in Q2 2025.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q4 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. Based on the strength of our Q3 and solid Q4 visibility, we are expecting a strong Q4 exit ending the year with higher organic constant currency growth rates than we forecasted just 90 days ago. At the same time, we are not expecting to see a significant release of excess client budgets and typical seasonality will also have an impact.\nCompared to Q3, Q4 is negatively impacted by a higher number of holidays, vacations and potential furloughs. As a reminder, we acquired NEORIS first derivative in Q4 2024 in November and December, respectively. As per our usual reporting practice, revenues from these acquisitions were moved from inorganic to organic in Q4 2025 as contemplated in our previous guidance.\nFacing a better-than-expected performance in the second half, coupled with improving visibility into Q4, we are raising the bottom end of the range for 2025 full year organic constant currency revenue growth and now expect the midpoint of the range to be 4.6%, an increase from the guidance we gave 90 days ago, which was 4% at the midpoint of the range. While driving top line revenue growth, we also remain focused on improving profitability. While there is more work to be done, we've been pleased with the results of our ongoing focus on improving account profitability, which is evident in our improved profitability outlook for Q4 and full year 2025.\nLastly, we continue to work on improving utilization and we continue to reduce isolated pockets of bench while adding that headcount to support growth. Our guidance continues to assume that we will be able to deliver out of our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024.\nMoving to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $5.0 million to $5.45 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint, with inorganic continuing to contribute approximately 9.1% for 2025. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange is now expected to have a positive impact on revenue growth of 1.3% and we expect year-over-year revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis to now be 4.6% at the midpoint.\nWe expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 9.4% to 9.7%, and non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 15% to 15.3%. And we expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 25%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of benefits and shortfalls related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%.\nAnd Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $6.75 to $6.83 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $11.36 to $1.44 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 56.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q4 2025 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.395 billion, producing a year-over-year growth of 11.1% at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 4.3% with a 2.4% positive FX impact during the quarter, producing a 4.4% organic constant currency growth rate at the midpoint of the range.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.08 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.18 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 55.1 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q4. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be $44 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $18 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be $1 million. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $16 million. We expect a tax shortfall related to stock-based compensation of around $1 million. Severance driven by our cost optimization program is expected to be around $10 million. And one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items, we now expect interest and other income to be $3 million for the remaining quarter.\nWe remain focused on driving revenue growth and enhancing profitability. -- we are confident in our strong positioning as we enter Q4. We will continue to run EPAM efficiently, maintaining our focus on both growth and profitability throughout the remainder of the year. Thanks again to all our employees for their dedication and focus, on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM.\nOperator, let's open the call for questions."

My name is Jeannie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EPAM Reports Results for Second Quarter 2025 Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Rowshandel\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2025 earnings announcement.

Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the investors section of our website. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to have it results on this call, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that our second quarter efforts delivered results ahead of expectations. -- marking another consecutive quarter of our performance and further shaping what we believe will be our durable and truly differentiation market proposition. Combining best-in-class AI nature services with our core engineering and practical consulting strengths.\nBefore we dive in, let me outline today's call. I will begin with our Q2 results and our performance and then walk through the foundational themes driving our improved growth rates. I will then hand it over to FB, who will share some highlights as the Chief Revenue Officer on how we position ourselves for continued sustainable growth. Finally, Jason will cover our detailed financial results and outlook. After that, the 3 of us will be available for our questions during the Q&A session.\nNow turning to our Q2 results. As we said it in our last update, we have been focused on sustaining sequential growth momentum even against the country's macroeconomic backdrop. In Q2, we once again delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, while in organic contribution played a significant role. It's important to note that our organic growth accelerated from the low single digits to the mid-single digits, exceeding the expectations set 90 days ago. This marks our third consecutive quarter of positive organic growth, reflecting steady improvements in our core business and a return to much more consistent performance.\nOur future growth was broad-based, with all 6 verticals growing year-over-year and sequentially. Not above $10 include financial services, emerging verticals and software and Fitch consumer goods, retail and travel as well as the business information in media was returned to positive year-over-year growth this quarter. Geographically, all 3 regions delivered a strong year-over-year growth, reinforce in our view that while demand conditions remain dynamic, the environment for EPAM is stabilizing and possibly improving across the whole of our core business. Now shifting to our position to the first half. While we anticipated early in the year that 2025 would remain a transitional period. We are encouraged to see how sequential momentum improved faster than anticipated. This continuous projects ramp up in Q2, driving what we believe is among the strongest organic constant currency growth rate in the industry in this trend.\nAs a reminder, our client base is almost exclusively large and midsized private sector enterprises. There is no exposure to [indiscernible] BP and legacy managed services and also remain very prudent and mindful of our clients own end markets in the current climate. We have seen no material impact on our business, unlike some of our peers. Our clients remain focused on strategic efficiency and growth with the palm play in a cut rolling board. Our investments in domain expertise, they are enabled delivery, quality standards across our global talent hubs and content client engagements are helping us to retain and expand, while share and win new logos, positioning us for stronger growth in 2025 versus 2024.\nIf you take a step back, there are 3 long-term additional SIMs, which together should help to explain why they should show in a different trajectory in the current market. We believe these things underpin our improving growth trends and position us for differentiated results in 2025 and beyond. Number one, we continue to see clients focus on quality as execution matters. EPAM today is known as a trusted strategic partner that consistently delivers quality outcomes. While we are building our own AI led consulting capabilities, our core focus is still on execution -- design, build and deploy mission-critical interpret products and platforms. Rooted in our heritage on culture, this differentiation is not easily replicated. The last several years have confirmed that. Our core engineering DNA as we might impact to multiple technology cycles, we will be even more critical in the [indiscernible] area.\nIn Q2, more clients entrusted us with their most complex ROI-driven programs, often expanding engagements to include new commercial and delivery models. These programs are also growing in scale. As AI becomes more deeply embedded across enterprises platform complexity will further increase disproportionately driving even greater demand was a reliable and to anti-optimized execution and this facilitization we provide. We are seeing some consolidation of demand, and we believe that part is benefiting through our ability to bring a unique combination of our native consulting engineering organizational enablement and transformational services. We are seeing more new SPs both for ready solutions and for the core system integration and modernization of the client prepared for AI adoption.\nNumber two, we continue to expand our market-leading positioning as an AI-native transformation company. Our only investments in AI are sharing as well and have enabled us to achieve a high level of high adoption and to build a highly advanced set of AI native capabilities, platforms, tools and accelerators. We would like to stress that the adoption alone while essential is not enough for long-term success. This is why today we offer a full range of air transformational capabilities from engineering to organizational enablement to our own proprietary and open source platform such as Dell and ARA. As a result, our native revenue is growing double digits sequentially, up from strong double digits last quarter. Looking at our top hungry clients the vast majority continue to be actively engaged with the initiative that now have moved bond experimental PVC to medium and larger scale programs and mainly adapting the pump platforms to accelerate those.\nThese platforms go beyond enabling agent workflows and data native reason. They rate structural challenges of deploying AI at scale across the enterprise. By integrating best of great external products, client-specific tools and both structure and structural data, they allow to close the integration gap faster, ensuring reliable cost-effective [ reparation ] and fostering in fresh white use. Importantly, they achieve this without looking clients into proprietary tools, reflecting the open source nature of most of our enablement offerings. In short, we are making meaningful progress in gaining significant momentum and becoming a native transformation company. And we expect the driver of growth to build further in the quarters ahead.\nIf we will be sharing more updates along the way, including showcasing the new high-impact proposition we are taking on the market.\nNumber three, we continue to scale and optimize our global delivery hubs. We're hearing clients more attractive and scalable options than ever before. We remain convinced that talent will be a critical driver of our industry future and growth and rapidly expanded market for [indiscernible] transformation, the ability to scale specialized talent is essential. So we are relentlessly training and upskilling our teams, particularly as we deploy AI to enhance both individual and team productivities. Our global for diversified tight in Europe, India, Latin America and Western and Central Asia is connected through a single proprietary delivery platform and unified AI-enabled delivery methodology. This integrated model provides greater resilience and enables us to deliver truly strategy global capabilities to lighter price that must constantly balance cost considerations and allocation strategy with business priorities. Each apart on the same delivery backbone supported by advanced training and globally managed technical assessments. Together, they drive collaboration or innovation and rated client access to advance native capabilities.\nOur operating model also support centers of excellence to strengthen horizontal capabilities such as data cloud and experience engineering and vertical [indiscernible] delivering end-to-end execution from strategies through implementation. This foundational seems our core differentiators and are essential for long-term growth. Kapan has taken the necessary steps to address our company's specific challenges of recent years. We're simultaneously positioning our underlying business for strong and sustainable organic constant currency growth and putting us in a much stronger position than we anticipated just 6 months ago. Lastly, today is my 52nd and final call as the CEO of EPAM. It was indeed an incredible journey for me from founding EPAM in 1993 and to our IPO Day in 2012 and to this moment.\nThis everything in between. So at this point, I would like to state that the CEO transition plan has been growing well and is on track to be completed by September 1, 2025, in which we will become our new Chief Executive Officer and President, and I transitioned into the role of Executive Chairman. The tactile changes, but my commitment doesn't. I look forward to continue supporting the long-term success of the company. I want to send the entire leadership team and all our employees around the world for their relents drive innovation commitment to engineering excellence and differentiation in value as they continue to deliver to our clients. With that, I want to welcome FB to provide some additional call. FB, over to you.\n\nBalazs Fejes\n\nPresident of Global Business & Chief Revenue Officer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to join you today from my seat as a Chief Revenue Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to walk you through some commercial and operational highlights of the quarter. the evolving market landscape and how our AI investments across go-to-market, partnerships, client engagement and technology are positioning us for continued sustainable growth.\nNow turning to market trends. and demand environment. As Ark mentioned, we are seeing some positive trends in our markets globally. The increasing attention on AI is triggering incremental demand and improving our overall picture -- more by accelerating cloud migration, growing demand for foundational data engineering, decisioning and the need to modernize and operationalize platforms and systems at scale. And because our clients are still focused on optimizing their investments. They are relying on EPAM to ensure that AI initiatives are carried out with the right rigor and accuracy to enable maximum flexibility in deployment methods to meet business objectives.\nI'm encouraged by the client sentiment both in North America and in Europe, showing stable and modestly growing demand, especially in our banking and financial services and life sciences and health care verticals, along with really strong growth in emerging sectors, especially in energy and oil and gas particularly in discretionary transformation programs, but we are seeing differentiation from EPAM bringing in net new opportunities across our portfolio. increasingly realized by our ability to orchestrate across our lines of business in core engineering, cloud, data and experience, led by our empathy lab proposition in Europe.\nClients remain focused on value realization and speed of innovation, and this is where our reputation for quality above commercial models and client-centric hybrid teams continues to be relevant. Shifting to our go-to-market and client-centric initiatives. We believe that the transformation in the IT services market opens new opportunities for us to capture additional market share. to better position ourselves, we have made meaningful progress on our go-to-market motions. Over the past quarter, you may have seen public announcements around our core engineering, cloud and AI initiatives, both independently and collaboration with partners.\nToday, we partner with over 150 global ecosystem partners and have achieved top-tier strategic partner status with all the core cloud and data platforms. our partnership strategy is client-centric and has become a corner store of EPAM's ability to bring the best-of-breed solutions to our global client base. particularly around complex clouding architecture and operationization of AI and Agentic workflows. As cases, this is the recent Databricks announcement where EPAM won the ML Growth Partner of the Year Award for rapidly expanding database adoption through large-scale data platform modernization and AI/ML innovation. In Q2, we further operationalize our vertical sales and account engagement structure with deeper alignment between our industry teams and solution practices. This enabled us to have better visibility into high potential deals and to improve win rates with new and existing strategic pursuits.\nOver the last couple of quarters, we have also progressively strengthened our field enablement. We rolled out a unified global CRM analytics platforms giving our sales and marketing teams real-time insights into deal velocity, deal qualification, pipeline health and client behavior. This is already improving our sales cycle efficiency and cross-selling effectiveness. Now turning to our transformation of services and key investments. Our services portfolio continues to evolve. A significantly higher proportion of our programs today are high-impact, consultative transformation engagement. The vast majority of our new wins this quarter were anchored in digital product and platform transformation, cloud and AI native services. We have made strategic investments in our key solutions areas, focused on generative AI, industry cloud accelerators, cybersecurity, data factory and customer experience transformation.\nThese solution centers sales of innovation hubs with clients and have already contributed to increasing our total wallet share over the same quarter last year. We also deepened our capabilities with 2 recent larger acquisitions. One in regulated industries, including financial services and other in cloud-native engineering and transformations, serving LatAm and Spanish-speaking market. These teams are quickly becoming integrated into selling and operational processes and already supporting our largest clients across most of our verticals.\nNow turning to our client engagement. Client centricity remains at the core of our operating model. We launched a new client success program this quarter, focusing on our top 100 clients. We continue to experiment and work with clients to provide additional flexibility with new engagement models, which have planned to scale in the future. For example, we have launched platform-based delivery for several AI operational engagements, allowing clients to consume AI as a service through our dial platform. This is delivering measurable efficiency gains and helping us to move up the volume chain.\nAnd finally, moving to AI and data-driven revenue transformation. We are deeply committed to using AI not just for our clients but also to transform our internal operations. Effectively, we view EPAM as customers 0 for anything we want to bring to the market with AI. This gives us a measurable edge in a competitive market. In addition, we have made strategic investments in our data platforms. And we now have a centralized data lake architecture powering everything from Client 360-degree views to marketing personalization. This is enabling more constructional conversations and sharper targeting across all channels.\nTo close, our operating momentum is strong. We are executing with discipline, aligning closely to client priorities and bringing forward innovations that differentiate us in the marketplace. Looking ahead, we see continued differentiation in EPAM's AI native services cloud and data modernization and agentic automation. Our commercial and operational foundations are strong, and we remain confident in our ability to capture net new demand and drive sustainable growth in the quarters to come. Jason, over to you.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, FB, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.353 billion a year-over-year increase of 18% on a reported basis, surpassing the upper end of our Q2 revenue outlook. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 5.3% compared to the second quarter of 2024. This marks our third quarter in a row delivering positive year-over-year organic constant currency growth, reflecting steady and resilient execution.\nAdditionally, we've returned to growth amidst to macroeconomic climate that remains complex. Our outperformance in the quarter was broad based, driven by improvements across all verticals and geographies. As Ark and FB mentioned, our strong results and continued sequential momentum are being driven by clients turning to EPAM for trusted quality coupled with accelerating momentum across our AI and AI native offerings. Moving to our Q2 vertical performance. All 6 industry verticals showed encouraging momentum and improvement this quarter. Our recent acquisitions in the OrisonFirst derivative also contributed positively, particularly within financial services and emerging verticals, complementing the strong underlying performance of our organic business.\nFinancial Services continued to deliver very strong double-digit growth, up 34.4% year-over-year on a reported basis, reflecting 6.5% organic growth in constant currency driven by strength across banking and insurance. Software and Hi-Tech grew 21.2% year-over-year, driven by strong execution and broad improvement across our existing clients as well as new logos. Life Sciences and Health care increased 11.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth in the vertical continues to be driven primarily by clients in life sciences and med tech. Consumer goods, retail and travel delivered 6.2% year-over-year growth, showing improvement versus recent quarters. The vertical delivered positive organic sequential growth in constant currency across both consumer products and retail as well as travel and hospitality.\nBusiness Information & Media also returned to growth, increasing 2.8% year-over-year. The return to growth within this vertical was driven by strong momentum across several key clients as well as revenue from new logos. Our emerging verticals delivered another quarter of very strong year-over-year growth of 28.7%, with [indiscernible] continuing to positively impact the vertical's performance. On an organic constant currency basis, growth was 3.3%, primarily driven by ongoing strength within energy, industrial materials and real estate. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q2 revenues, grew 15.9% year-over-year on a reported basis, reflecting 3.8% organic growth in constant currency.\nEMEA comprising 39% of our Q2 revenues increased 21.7% year-over-year, reflecting 7.6% organic growth in constant currency. And finally, APAC making up 2% of our revenues increased 13% year-over-year, reflecting 8.3% organic growth in constant currency. Lastly, in Q2, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 8.8% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 23%. Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 28.8% and compared to 29.3% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.1% compared to 30.8% for the same period a year ago. Somewhat higher variable compensation, combined with lower profitability associated with recent acquisitions, both contributed to the lower gross margin level. The company continues to focus on improving utilization and gross margin, and we'll maintain this focus throughout the remainder of the year. GAAP SG&A was 17.1% of revenue compared to 16.9% in Q2 of last year.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in Q2 2025 came in at 14.1% of revenue compared to 14.3% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $126 million or 9.3% of revenue in the quarter compared to $121 million or 10.5% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $203 million or 15% of revenue in the quarter compared to $175 million or 15.2% of revenue in Q2 of the previous year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 28.9%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.56 and -- our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.77 compared to $2.45 in Q2 of last year, reflecting a $0.32 increase year-over-year. In Q2, there were approximately 56.5 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $53 million compared to $57 million in the same quarter of 2024. Free cash flow was $43 million compared to free cash flow of $52 million in the same quarter last year. Cash and cash equivalents were just over $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. At the end of Q2, DSO was 78 days and compares to 75 days for Q1 2025, and 76 days for the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the second quarter were approximately 1.1 million shares for $195 million at an average price of $179.23 per share. Moving on to operational metrics. We ended Q2 with more than 55,800 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, reflecting total growth of 18.7% and organic growth of 6.7% compared to Q2 2024. In the quarter, we added approximately 200 delivery professionals. Our total headcount at quarter end was just over 62,000 employees.\nUtilization was 78.1% compared to 77.5% in both Q2 of last year, in Q1 2025, driven by bench optimization efforts. Now let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q3 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. Our solid financial performance in H1 amidst economic and tariff-related uncertainty continues to be driven by clients who value our strong delivery execution across all our global delivery locations. We are also highly encouraged to see accelerating growth in our advanced AI native offerings, which contributed to our improving revenue growth rates.\nWith good visibility into Q3, we expect further improvement in our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rate in the quarter. With regards to the full year, I would like to remind everyone of the typical seasonal impacts in the second half. Relative to Q2, Q3 benefits from more build days contributing positively to sequential revenue growth. Compared to Q3, Q4 is negatively impacted by a higher number of holidays, vacations and potential for less. EPAM's revenues in our Q3 pipeline have developed nicely throughout the year. But we also realized that we're still operating in a dynamic demand environment. We want to continue to be prudent with our approach to guidance and currently expect Q4 revenue to be predominantly driven by seasonal factors which will likely result in flat to a modest decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4.\nWe expect to continue to see strong inorganic revenue contributions from the Euros and first derivative particularly in the financial services and emerging verticals. Based on our strong H1 performance and good visibility into Q3, we are raising the bottom end of the range for 2025 full year organic constant currency revenue growth. Additionally, due to a further appreciation in the Euro and GBP, we will also be increasing the FX contribution to reported revenue growth. While driving top line revenue growth, we will also remain focused on improving gross margin. We are working on improving utilization and we'll continue to reduce isolated pockets of bench while adding net headcount to support growth. Our guidance continues to assume that we will be able to deliver out of our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024.\nMoving to our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be in the range of 13% to 15%, with inorganic continue to contribute approximately 9% for 2025. Based on today's spot exchange rates, coupled with the assumption of modest strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the second half, foreign exchange is now expected to have a positive impact on revenue growth of 0.9%. We expect year-over-year revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis to now be in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 9% to 10%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 26%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate which excludes the impact of benefits and shortfalls related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%.\nEarnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $6.48 to $6.64 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.96 to $11.12 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 56.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Moving to our Q3 2025 outlook, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.380 billion producing year-over-year growth of 17.6% at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 10.4%, with a 1.0% positive FX impact during the quarter producing a 6.2% organic constant currency growth rate at the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.89 to $1.97 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.06 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 55.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q3 and Q4. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $44 million for Q3 and $45 million for Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $18 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nThe impact of foreign exchange is expected to be an approximate $2 million loss for Q3 and to be negligible for Q4. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $17 million for Q3 and $16 million for Q4. We expect minimal excess tax benefits or shortfalls in the remaining quarters. Severance driven by our cost optimization program is expected to be around $9 million for Q3 and $8 million for Q4. And one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items, we now expect interest and other income to be $3 million for each of the remaining quarters. We remain committed to driving revenue growth and improving profitability in the second half and we are confident in our strong positioning entering Q3 despite the dynamic environment. We will continue to run e-payment efficiently, maintaining our focus on profitability throughout the remainder of the year. Thanks again to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM.\nI would now like to take a moment to acknowledge Ark's leadership and the profound impact he has had across the industry, our clients and our company. Ark has successfully led EPAM through multiple tax cycles over multiple decades, and he has positioned the company to capture the next wave of AI-driven growth. Leading the company through a challenging couple of years and a near existential crisis resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ark has played an instrumental role in our return to growth. Today, EPAM is better positioned than ever as a truly global company offering industry-leading, delivery execution across all of our geographic delivery hubs.\nOn a personal note, it's been an honor working with Ark, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as Executive Chairman. Operator, let's open the call up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI'd now like to welcome Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Mike, over to you.\n\nMike Rowshandel\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations.\nWe hope you've had an opportunity to review the 2 news releases we shared earlier today. If you have not, copies are available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures, and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you may have seen in our additional press release this quarter, we have one more update to share today that goes beyond our usual business performance. [indiscernible] our strong Q1 results despite a tough market environment, we also announced our planned leadership succession. So before we get into the details of our performance and growth momentum, I want to take a moment to share a few thoughts on my plan transition from CEO.\nAfter 32 years since starting EPAM [indiscernible] the Chairman, CEO and President, I decided to transition into the role of the Executive Chairman. This move has been thoughtfully planned over the past several years, and I believe that the right moment is now, both for me personally and for the future of the company.\nBut I'm not leaving EPAM. As Executive Chairman, I plan to continue providing strategic guidance, combining my years of experience, the [indiscernible] relationships and Board leadership, and ensuring that the CEO transition is smooth and effective. And that EPAM continues to advance in our mission, culture and growth.\nBeyond the transition period, I will be actively engaged as an employee of the company and helping to shape upon long-term strategic direction, maintaining key relationships with clients, partners and investors, providing guidance on critical strategic initiatives and programs and promoting the company brand worldwide. I will closely collaborate on the CEO and the leadership team to help encourage the various relationship and strategic focus that we have defined EPAM for decades, continue to grow the company in the future.\nWith that said, I am pleased to announce today that Balazs Fejes will become our new Chief Executive Officer and President on September 1, 2025. Balazs, better known as FB, joined the company over 20 years ago, and has been a critical part of our growth story. His leadership has been instrumental EPAM's development, sharing our [indiscernible], building our financial services business globally, leading our European and APAC markets, and most recently, serving as the President of Global Business and Chief Revenue Officer.\nFB is uniquely positioned to provide both strategic and operational leadership during our next phase of evolution. I'm confident that his rare combination of business and technical acumen will enable him to continue driving EPAM forward. FB brings not only deep operational experience, but also a strong sense of energy and vision for EPAM's continuous evolution into the world-leading AI native transformation company with a reputation for quality, execution and excellence, commitment to our customers, employees and communities. In terms of timing and priorities, we remain focused on Q2 and full 2025 execution, working hard to extend our sequential momentum by driving and winning more weather share.\nThe CEO transition plan should be completed on September 1, 2025, at which point, we will provide a more comprehensive update with an opportunity to hear directly from FB. I look forward to working closely with him, our entire executive team and the Board, to support the continuous growth and long-term success of the company as EPAM enters the next phase of [indiscernible].\nNow let's turn to our Q1 results. I'm pleased to share today that our first quarter results came in better than expected, despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment than most would have predicted 90 days ago. This marks also consecutive quarter of outperformance, and we are pleased to see sequential momentum, which we hope will continue throughout the remainder of this year.\nIn a climate where cost continues to be top of mind, our client conversations have been broadly positive. And we are encouraged to see EPAM benefit from supplier consolidation activity in our core portfolio. It continues to be our view that the pivot towards reliability and quality is slowly progressing. EPAM's proven track record and reputation for high-quality execution puts us in a sweet spot, and is driving increased levels of new deal activity, which is enabling us to maintain and grow our organic footprint with existing clients.\nOutside the volatility of the broader geopolitical economic environment, most of the growth, since we have been discussing over the past few quarters, especially AI related, have continued through Q1, and we expect we will carry throughout the remainder of this year.\nDuring Q1, we returned to double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. And while our inorganic contribution was driving a large portion of that, we are notably delivering year-over-year organic growth as well, which was significantly above our initial Q1 expectations [indiscernible] being flat at the midpoint of our guidance. This marks our second quarter in a row of delivering positive year-over-year organic growth since 2022, and illustrates continuous improvement in the core business.\nOverall, in Q1, client sentiment and engagement remain strong across most of our verticals and geographies, is particularly high interest in our rapidly expanding AI-related capabilities. Our performance this quarter was driven by meaningful progress in strengthening client engagement, enhancing cross-selling efforts and continuing to deliver advanced complex solutions. Our global footprint, supported by robust platforms, tools and diversified talent hubs is enabling us to effectively meet the evolving needs of our clients in a rapidly changing business environment.\nNow turning to demand. Despite the notable changes over the past 90 days, we remain cautiously optimistic, given our strong Q1 results and the Q2 momentum we have built. The February and March project ramp-up dynamics that is signaled last quarter [ split ] better than expected, with the client sentiment continues to improve.\nFurther, we are encouraged by the incremental demand we continue to see for our AI capabilities, [indiscernible] focus on productivity and efficiency gains turns into more comprehensive AI native transformation programs and encompass multiple types of AI-centered solutions. In short, our baseline client demand in H1 is improving faster than anticipated.\nWhile we remain mindful of external pressures caused by challenges in our clients and markets as well as related instances of increased caution and shift in decision-making due to macroeconomic uncertainty, we have not seen any material impact on our business to date. Overall, we feel good about the resilience of our performance so far this year. It's also important to emphasize that we are doing everything we can to stay closely aligned with our clients, taking proactive disciplined steps to effectively manage our operations, ensuring we are well prepared to respond to any potential impact as we head into the second half of 2025.\nIn addition, reflecting our recent client conversations, one thing becomes clear. During the past few years of greater volatility, some clients who have prioritized cost above all else in selecting partners are now returning to EPAM. Their experience with underperforming programs has reinforced the critical value of deep expertise, consistent delivery quality and the trusted ability to execute at scale. That is why even as we expect 2025 to remain a year of transition with the potential to increase uncertainty in the second half, we believe clients will continue to focus on the most strategic priorities, which should translate into stronger growth for us compared to 2024. In our credibility and growing reputation as a leading partner in AI and native transformation are already driving greater market awareness and demand, a trend we expect to continue throughout the remainder of this year.\nNow moving onto our 4 global delivery hubs, which now are working together in some new ways and with rapidly growing access to our advanced AI enabled productivity platforms. In Q1, we saw another quarter of sequential increase in net organic head count across India, Europe and Western Central Asia.\nCentral Eastern Europe continues to be a cornerstone geography for us and serves as a backbone for many long-term clients with growing global location strategies. We saw modest growth in Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Serbia and stability across the rest of the region. Ukraine as well remained stable in terms of scale and product capabilities as our nearly 9,000 people remain highly productive and continue to support both new and current clients across a diverse range of programs.\nIn India, we continue to see strong demand for our differentiated product contributing questionings inside our core capabilities and platforms, cloud data and AI. The momentum we built last quarter credit out into Q1, with additional net head count growth. We are also deepening our relationships with global capability centers or GCCs, reinforcing our role as a trusted transformation partner.\nIn Western and Central Asia, we continue to invest and expand our delivery presence with modest net additions across several locations. As we shared in the past, these locations allow us to have even greater ability when it comes to serving our clients by balancing cost, quality and execution, and in some cases, proximity to client locations.\nFinally, in Latin America, we continue to progress with our significantly expanding client and talent footprint with the addition of NEORIS.\nNow shifting to AI. As highlighted in our recently published AI report, while improved productivity and operational efficiency remain universal growth. [indiscernible] AI adoption across the enterprise continues to be a challenge. In fact, only 30% of even the most advanced companies [ worldwide ] reported success in agreements in AI scale. Given that AI scale remains a relatively new concern today, we believe the broader transformation required, including modernizing platforms, data, organize and all structures, skills and business processes. All of that represents a significant opportunity for EPAM. Our unique combination of deep engineering and consulting expertise, backed by our advanced suite of IP tools and accelerators, position us well to [indiscernible] the space.\nWhile the air landscape is evolving rapidly, one thing is undeniable, AI continues to drive new demand for us. Even in the context of traditional modernization programs, AI plays a central role in majority of client discussions. We are currently engaged in a wide range of AI initiatives with the vast majority of our top country clients. Our stage AI engagements are maturing visibly with a strong year-over-year growth, with more of them evolving into a midsized projects with clearly defined outcomes and measurable ROIs. As we expand into larger scale air factories, these programs are becoming increasingly [indiscernible]. Now incorporating agentic AI in government's framework while also scaling in volume and complexity.\nIn Q1, our AI native revenues grew strong double-digit quarter-over-quarter, continues the strong momentum from the previous quarter. As we continue to mature our air consulting and engineering [indiscernible], we have also strengthening our overall value proposition by partnering with strategic players in cloud, data and platforms to deliver innovative commercially attractive software assets focused on industry-specific transformation and productivity gains.\nOne illustrative example of our progress is in oil and gas and manufacturing vertical, where we developed breakthrough innovation in AI-powered [indiscernible] special data visualization and insights. Built in partnership with Google Cloud Industry Solutions, this work led to EPAM being named Google 2025 Partners of the Year for Oil & Gas. The solution, which integrates with Google Gemini models, can also apply to broader data challenges across manufacturing and supply chain use cases, demonstrating our deep domain expertise, our ability to handle large, incomplete data sets and our proven track in delivering AI native cloud-based applications at scale.\nAnother strong example is our ongoing effort to advance global engineering productivity through AI. Our focus extends beyond individual cogeneration to full life cycle transformation in team environments. In Q3 of last year, we introduced EPAM AI/RUN, our AI native [indiscernible] framework and toolkit. And we are now well positioned to build on this foundation through a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS.\nBy leveraging advanced generative AI services, including Amazon Bedrock, drilling power plants to develop specialized agent in AI native solution that addresses the [indiscernible] productivity challenges for large teams. This collaboration creates a robust platform for accelerating cloud and data modernization through AI-driven workflow and tooling automation.\nFinally, to restate our continuous innovation with the EPAM DIAL platform, we continue to integrate advanced technologies into custom talent business strategies, which is driving significant impact across the industry and open source community. DIAL has a role through several advancements and iterations since we started building it. Today, DIAL is a complete Gen AI platform with orchestration, including agent marketplace, [ mind maps ] and DIAL expressive logic and so much more. DIAL is evolving into a complete AI platform for enterprises.\nTo conclude, we are pleased with our stronger-than-expected Q1 results, the improvement in organic growth and the sequential momentum we continue to build. Our increasingly diversified and agile global delivery hubs, combined with advanced native capabilities and different strategic partnerships are having a real impact. As we said it last quarter, we expected 2025 to be a transformative year. And that outlook is proven true. We [indiscernible] even more reasonably than we anticipated 3 months ago. We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and remain cautiously optimistic about the second half of 2025, even as macro uncertainty persists. Our focus and disciplined execution remains our top priority.\nLet me now turn call over to Jason, who will provide additional details on our Q1 results and 2025 outlook.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 11.7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue grew 1.4% compared to the first quarter of 2024, exceeding our expectations of flat organic growth anticipated at the midpoint of our Q1 guidance.\nWe are pleased to deliver another quarter of year-over-year organic growth in constant currency, reflecting ongoing demand for EPAM services and strong execution across our global portfolio of clients. As Ark mentioned, we believe the outperformance is in part driven by client recognition of EPAM's superior delivery quality and momentum across our AI offerings.\nMoving to our Q1 vertical performance. 4 out of the 6 industry verticals delivered strong to very strong revenue growth. Revenues from our FD and NEORIS acquisitions had the most impact on our financial services and emerging verticals. So I will break out the organic and inorganic contribution within these 2 verticals.\nFinancial Services delivered very strong growth of 29.3% year-over-year, reflecting 4.5% organic growth in constant currency, driven by continued strength in insurance, banking and payments. Software and Hi-Tech grew 9.6% year-over-year, driven by strong execution and broad improvement across our existing portfolio as well as new logo activity. Life Sciences and Health care increased 10.5% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in life sciences and med tech. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 1.4% year-over-year, largely due to declines in consumer products and retail, partially offset by growth in travel. Business information and media declined 2.2% year-over-year.\nOur emerging verticals delivered very strong growth of 22.8%. Growth was positively impacted by NEORIS Industrial Materials customers. Emerging verticals organic revenue in constant currency contracted by 3.5% and was negatively impacted by softness across manufacturing and telecom clients.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas is our largest region, representing 60% of our Q1 revenues, grew 12.6% year-over-year. EMEA, representing 38% of our Q1 revenues, increased 10.7% year-over-year. And finally, APAC, representing 2% of our revenues, increased 4.3% year-over-year. Each of our geographies delivered year-over-year organic constant currency revenue growth in the quarter.\nLastly, in Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 6.1% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 14.6%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26.9% compared to 28.4% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 28.7% compared to 30.4% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q1 2024, gross margin in Q1 2025 was negatively impacted by 2024 compensation increases, which were only partially offset through pricing.\nAdditionally, lower profitability from recent acquisitions negatively impacted gross margin. The negative impacts from compensation and lower profitability from acquisitions exceeded the benefits of improved utilization and the positive impact from the [ Polish ] R&D incentive. The company will be focused on improving gross margin throughout the remainder of the year.\nGAAP SG&A was 16.8% of revenue compared to 17% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q1 2025 came in at 14.2% of revenue compared to 14.1% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $99 million or 7.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $111 million or 9.5% of revenues in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $176 million or 13.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $174 million or 14.9% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 22.2% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.1%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.28. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.41 compared to $2.46 in Q1 of last year, reflecting a $0.05 decrease year-over-year. In Q1, there were approximately 57.3 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $24 million compared to $130 million in the same quarter of 2024. Higher bonus payments in Q1 2025 and a higher DSO resulting from the impact of an increasing share of fixed fee revenues with associated milestone billing, both contributed to the year-over-year decline in operating cash flows. Free cash flow was $15 million compared to free cash flow of $123 million in the same quarter last year. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion as of the end of the quarter. At the end of Q1, DSO was 75 days and compares to 70 days for Q4 2024, and 73 days for the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the first quarter were approximately 796,000 shares for $160 million at an average price of $201.7 per share.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q1 with more than 55,600 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, reflecting total growth of 18.2% and organic growth of 6.4% compared to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we added over 500 professionals. Our total head count for the quarter was more than 61,700 employees. Utilization was 77.5% compared to 76.8% in Q1 of last year and 76.2% in Q4 2024.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q2 outlook, I'd like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. While the macroeconomic environment remains highly dynamic, we are pleased with our strong Q1 performance, with year-over-year organic constant currency revenue growth exceeding our expectations. This has resulted in 3 consecutive quarters of sequential organic revenue growth. With good visibility into Q2, we expect ongoing improvement in our organic revenues with both year-over-year and sequential growth in the quarter.\nWe continue to experience improving demand for our highly differentiated services, and client budgets appear to remain substantially intact with a few pockets of caution, which we are closely monitoring. Clients are turning to EPAM for trusted quality of execution and our advanced AI offerings. To date, we have not seen a material slowdown in client spending as evidenced by our stronger-than-expected Q1 performance and sequential momentum we have seen thus far in Q2. That said, we acknowledge the elevated uncertainty in macroeconomic risk. Considering our stronger-than-expected first half balanced with a thoughtful assessment of client demand in our second half, we are raising the lower end of our organic full year revenue guidance, while leaving the upper end of the range unchanged.\nThere were several additional factors impacting our view of revenue growth during the remainder of the year. Since we issued guidance last quarter, certain currencies have strengthened considerably relative to the U.S. dollar. At the same time, due to the elevated uncertainties resulting from tariffs and impacts on the manufacturing and materials industries, we are seeing a reduction in demand from a top customer acquired as part of our NEORIS risk acquisition.\nWith our improved organic revenue contribution, the expected benefit from foreign exchange, partially offset by a modest reduction in expected inorganic revenues, we are raising both the upper and lower end of our reported revenue guidance. Our guidance continues to assume that we will be able to deliver out of our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024.\nSo moving on to the full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be in the range of 11.5% to 14.5%, with an inorganic contribution of approximately 9% for 2025. Based on today's spot exchange rates, coupled with an assumption of modest strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the second half, foreign exchange is now expected to have a positive impact on revenue growth of 0.4%. We expect year-over-year revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis to now be in the range of 2% to 5%.\nWe expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 25%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, will continue to be 24%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $6.78 to $7.03 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.70 to $10.95 for the full year. The increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS is in part driven by our assumption of a reduced share count resulting from our plan to increase share repurchases within the constraints of the current share repurchase authorization. We now expect weighted average share count of 56.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q2 2025 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.340 billion, producing year-over-year growth of 16.2% at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 10.6%, with a 1.8% positive foreign exchange impact during the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.75 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.64 for the quarter. With increases in share repurchases during the year, we expect a weighted average share count of 56.7 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for Q2 and the full year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $40 million for Q2, $45 million for Q3 and $46 million for Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $17 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible for each of the remaining quarters.\nTax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13 million for Q2 and $15 million for Q3 and $14 million for Q4. We expect excess tax shortfall to be around $1 million for Q2, with minimal excess tax benefits or shortfalls in the remaining quarters. Severance driven by our cost optimization programs is expected to be around $2 million in Q2 and $3 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nFinally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With the increased share repurchases, we will have a lower level of interest generating cash. Therefore, we now expect interest and other income to be $2 million in both Q2 and Q3 and $3 million in Q4.\nWe remain committed to continuing to drive sequential momentum and are confident in our positioning entering Q2 despite the dynamic environment. We will continue to run EPAM efficiently while remaining focused on strong execution and profitability throughout the year.\nLastly, my continued thanks to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM.\nOperator, let's open the call for questions."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's good to share that our fourth quarter results came in better than expected. It was another quarter of strong execution. Thanks to our core engineering differentiation and relevance of our advanced capabilities and service offerings across our new and existing client portfolios. Many of the encouraging themes we shared last quarter have carried through into this quarter. Before discussing our Q4 results and some thoughts on 2025, I would like to step back and reflect on the full year 2024, which was a year of uneven demand, improved stabilization and building some sequential momentum.\nThere are 3 key points I would like to highlight on our performance over the past year. Number one, we were successfully executing our global business strategy while simultaneously addressing many challenges we have accumulated during the last few years. We've done this both organically and through acquisitions. There is a continuous focus on becoming the more globally geo-balanced training company in the world for AI native digital business services.\nThe 2 most recent acquisitions, NEORIS and First Derivative, or FD, are good examples of how we are investing to accelerate our strategy. They allowed us to meaningfully expand our existing global client relationship and further penetrate new markets and talent geo-hubs. While still early, we see encouraging progress across several net new opportunities with more than a dozen joint pursuits that combine EPAM, NEORIS and FD capabilities together.\nNumber two, we are pleased to end the year with an underlying improvement on our stand-alone business, delivering better results than our expectations earlier in the year, and we had to adjust our outlook for the weaker-than-expected H1. And finally, number three, exiting 2024, we feel good about the sequential momentum we've built over the past 2 quarters and see encouraging signs as we look ahead into 2025.\nAs there is still plenty of caution and broad market sensitivity, we believe we see some fundamental improvements in the business, which gives us optimism that 2025 will be much more transformative and better year for us than 2024 was. Now turning to our Q4 results.\nDuring Q4, we grew mid-single digits both year-over-year and sequentially. Notably, returning to organic revenue growth for the first time since Q1 of 2023. We continue to see improvements in client sentiments and engagements across all our verticals and geographies and particularly around our AI-related capabilities. Our performance in Q4 was driven by our ability to increase our clients' trust and reassure continuous superior quality execution in our key horizontal and vertical domains, while simultaneously offering more globally diversified [ target ].\nOn a stand-alone basis, excluding recent acquisitions, we saw 4 out of 6 verticals grew year-over-year with 5 out of 6 growing sequentially, reflecting strong momentum from last quarter. Key verticals to call out include life sciences and health care, software and hi-tech, financial Services and emerging. Across geographies, we see a similar story to last quarter with Americas and APAC leading growth year-over-year, with Europe continued to show [ organic situation ] revenue growth. Now turning to demand. We are encouraged to see a modestly more positive demand environment compared to 90 days ago. Sentiment continues to improve across our existing and newly acquired client portfolios. These clients rely on us for our core engineering DNA as well as our advanced GenAI capabilities.\nIn some cases, we are consolidating work from other suppliers as clients shift toward a more engineering led and scale programs. In our most recent conversations across the C-suite, the underlying tone and buying signals are higher than they were last year. With further accumulation of technical and data debt over the past 12 months, we are seeing accelerated take-up in more scale and transformational AI programs.\nBased on the significant backlog of technical and data modernization, along with new AI-related demand, we believe that 2025 will be the year where we begin to see real GenAI first-mover advantages. While we are relatively optimistic about the midterm outlook, there is more encouraging client buying signals than 12 months back. We do still see multiple packets of caution driven by broad macro risks, policy specific uncertainty due to a very dynamic geopolitical environment and certain challenges in some of our clients and talent market.\nFurther, cost very much remains in focus and continues to be an important decision factor for many of our clients. So based on these uncertainties, in our current vantage point, we are balancing our optimism as clients continue to transition and modestly expand their discretionary spend. Moving into our global delivery approach, we demonstrated strong execution throughout the year. As we continue to diversify our global talent pools and bring in more optionality to our clients across all 4 of our major delivery hubs in Europe, India, Latin America and Western and Central Asia.\nIn Q4, we saw sequential improvements of net organic additions which was broader than just India and included some of our traditional European locations. Europe remains core to us as a top talent pool, and we believe we will continue to grow in the region as discretionary spend returns to higher levels. Ukraine is an interesting example to share given the geopolitical environment. Our production headcount remained mostly in line year-over-year.\nIn Q4, we saw sequential net additions for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion. We believe this is a positive signal of our clients' comfort level and desire to return to some of our traditional locations. In India, we hit an important milestone for the company as it now represents our largest single country delivery location and second as a region. In just 10 years, EPAM has achieved 10x growth in India with now over 10,000 employees. This speaks to our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and our commitment to invest in a globally diverse and talent workforce in line with EPAM work DNA.\nIn Latin America, we significantly strengthened our footprint with NEORIS, making Latin America, our third largest delivery region and a very important pillar in our global model. We believe we have now the right mix of talent focusing on delivery for North American clients, coupled with deep local expertise and strong capabilities to engage and deliver in LatAm. In Western Central Asia, as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to progress quite nicely with our still relatively new delivery hub of over 7,300 people now.\nBack to the 2 acquisitions we closed in Q4. In overall, with NEORIS and FD, we significantly increased our global footprint with the addition of nearly 6,000 people combined, primarily across Latin America, Canada, Spain, U.K. and Ireland. We remain committed to executing our global delivery strategy further. Now shifting to GenAI. Even with all the recent noise, sometimes the significant level of confusion and debates, we are seeing indicators of positive change and growing impact. Overall, we continue to make significant traction across our client portfolio with now 75% of our top 100 clients engaged on GenAI initiatives.\nOur early-stage projects continued to show strong growth year-over-year with hundreds of new verticals, use cases emerging and turning into agentic AI pilots. Within our midsized AI projects with more defined outcomes, we are beginning to see more volume, and we believe this speaks to the investment and traction clients are making in this space. These programs have a high probability of turning into agentic transformation plays in key horizontal and vertical domains.\nFinally, in our larger scale AI factories, we manage the entire portfolio of agents and applications throughout the program life cycle and generate tens of millions of dollars in value by each such engagement. Our GenAI and AI driven client engagement could also be presented in 3 major dimensions. Dimension 1 is DOC and other related areas of individual and team productivity improvements.\nDimension 2, data and cloud engagements triggered by the need to enable a AI-native programs at scale. Dimension 3 scale AI-native programs and platforms as a goal to drive value against proven business cases and when clients already solve their data and cloud infrastructure challenges. Let me expand a bit on this. Within Dimension 1, we are addressing the need of complex enterprise-level engagements to orchestrate individual efforts toward total productivity improvements at large teams and programs levels via all latest GenAI advances.\nOften to have real engagement impact, our hybrid client teams must have the same level of modern engineering maturity has purposely GenAI trained our own teams. That is why we are offering to client GenAI-enabled software development life cycle or SDLC transformational programs, utilizing market-leading tools and methodologies along with the EPAM AI/Run framework built on top of our own DIAL, EliteA, [indiscernible] and some other IP assets. It\nmay significantly impact on large concrete engagement and helps to advance the adoption of AI in large-scale enterprises while bringing measurable value through both cost optimization and the creation of new revenue streams. While I believe dimension 2 is very much self-explanatory, Dimension 3 is our go-to-market business transformation programs, natively enabled by GenAI and AI technology. As we move into a more comprehensive agentic proposition, our AI native engagement are starting to be picked up in the volume and size.\nCompared to the first half of 2024, where we were generating single-digit millions of revenue from this AI-native programs, Q4 stands out by generating about $50 million in that category. Let me share 2 client examples to further illustrate how our efforts are driving client engagement and generating real pragmatic value. Let's start with Canadian Tire Corporation, the largest retail chain in Canada, where we have embarked on a journey to standardize and modernize source to deliver life cycle. With the combined power of CTC Product Engineering Center of Excellence and EPAM know-how, we are already driving initial results with very real optimization and efficiency savings.\nSo far EPAM has effectively deployed the EliteA platform across CTC delivery organization, trained more than 700 individuals and ensures comprehensive adoption of new modernized tools. This is a real example of how our approach amplifies organizational productivity, reduces costs and improves in team and cross-team collaboration and serves as foundation for the next-generation agentic platform for SDLC.\nAnother notable example of real progress at scale is our expanded engagements with Baker Hughes, one of the world's largest oil field services, industrial and energy technology companies. We are enabling Baker Hughes in building and offering to their clients, larger AI native digital platforms by combining EPAM PAM best-in-class product engineering capabilities with Baker Hughes expertise in energy technology. Just a few weeks ago, Baker Hughes named EPAM as a key partner for digital NAI to transform the energy sector while leveraging advanced AI-native digital platform implementations at scale.\nWe believe EPAM is one of the few AI-native service providers who can demonstrate scale programs with proven AI ROI today, which is also well enabled by our growing global partnerships with cloud and data major providers with whom we are expanding our collaborations and focusing on general agentic AI road to marketplace.\nNow if we step back and look at a bigger picture, more broadly for 2025 and beyond. Our thesis remains unchanged. We believe the demand for advanced AI native and agentic software and data engineering services will only increase as engineering productivity gains will be significantly outsized by incremental demand to build new and replace the legacies as clients quickly expand in their focus to solve more complex tasks more efficiently. Further, the need for security modernization and managing enterprise data platforms will continue to demand skilled expertise that combines critical skills with modern engineering and data science capabilities, all areas in which EPAM excels.\nTo conclude, we are pleased with our stronger-than-expected Q4 results and stabilization achieved during the last year. Our new AI-native capabilities, data and core engineering differentiation remained evident. While we are more globally diversified today than ever before, we continue to see clients return to quality and reliable execution, and we believe that is putting us into a stronger competitive position today compared to last year.\nAt the same time, we do believe 2025 will be still a challenging and transformative year for the industry, with a lot of pressure to navigate 2 opposite trends across our client base. One is still being driven by cost sensitivity, while in other, by the need to return to more discretionary spending and addressing accumulated during the last few years backlog, which means also that EPAM will be performing during 2025. This continuous margin pressures triggered by necessity to invest across several important for us in 2025 areas such as critical skills and talent retention and development, agentic AI and GenAI IP including advancements, integration efforts of our recent acquisitions and go-to-market strategies. That should allow us to be in the right standing when discretionary demand environment will fully rebound. So while we remain vigilant to potential headwinds, we believe our strategic positioning and ongoing initiative place us on the trajectory for sustainable performance and growth in 2025 and beyond.\nLet me now turn the call over to Jason who will provide additional details on our Q4 results and 2025 outlook.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.25 billion, a year-over-year increase of 7.9% on a reported basis, including revenues from recent acquisitions, NEORIS and First Derivative. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues grew 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In Q4, we are pleased to return to year-over-year organic revenue growth. Organic revenues exceeded our Q4 guidance due to higher-than-expected new project starts, indicating modestly improving client sentiment. .\nDue to the quarter's significant inorganic revenue contribution, I will speak to both organic and inorganic revenues as I discuss industry vertical and geographic performance. Beginning with industry verticals, I want to echo Ark's comments that in Q4, 5 out of 6 of our industry verticals delivered sequential organic revenue growth. Only the travel and consumer vertical declined Q3 to Q4.\nFinancial Services delivered very strong growth of 15.9% year-over-year, reflecting [ 4.3% ] organic and 11.6% inorganic growth, driven by continued strength in the banking, insurance and payment sector. Life Sciences and Health care increased 8.6% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting 5.7% organic and 2.9% inorganic growth. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in life sciences, including some revenues derived from new logo accounts.\nSoftware and Hi-Tech increased 7.7% year-over-year, reflecting 6.4% organic and 1.3% inorganic growth. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting a negative 5.7% organic and a positive 2.7% inorganic growth largely due to declines in consumer products and retail, partially offset by growth in travel. Business information and media declined 3.9% year-over-year, reflecting negative 4.7% organic and positive 0.8% inorganic growth.\nRevenue in the quarter was impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of the top 20 clients. However, sequentially, we were encouraged to see the vertical return to strong growth as we continue to build momentum. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered very strong growth of 24.8%, reflecting 3% organic and 21.8% inorganic growth. Growth was primarily driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and industrial materials with significant contribution coming from NEORIS.\nFrom a geographic perspective, the Americas, our largest region, representing 60% of our Q4 revenues, increased 11.4% year-over-year, reflecting 2.7% organic and 8.7% inorganic growth. EMEA, representing 38% of our Q4 revenues increased 3.1% year-over-year, reflecting a negative 1.4% organic and positive 4.5% inorganic growth. In the quarter, the region continued to show sequential organic revenue improvement. And finally, APAC increased 4.3% year-over-year and represents 2% of our revenues.\nIn Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 4% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 increased 10%. Moving on to the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.4% compared to 31.1% in Q4 of last year.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.2% compared to 33% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q4 2023, gross margin in Q4 2024 was negatively impacted by compensation increases, including those resulting from our 2024 promotion campaign, which we were not able to offset through pricing as well as lower profitability of recent acquisitions.\nThe compensation increases, along with lower profitability from acquisitions and negative foreign exchange impact, exceeded the benefits of improved utilization and a positive impact from the Polish R&D incentive. GAAP SG&A was 17.4% of revenue compared to 18.5% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.4% of revenue compared to 14.2% in the same period last year.\nSG&A measured as a percent of revenue is now higher in part due to our recent acquisitions running with higher SG&A levels compared to our stand-alone business. SG&A expense for Q4 2024 reflects SG&A associated with recent acquisitions as well as higher variable compensation compared to Q4 2023. GAAP income from operations was $137 million or 10.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $122 million or 10.6% of revenue in Q4 of last year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations was $208 million or 16.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $200 million or 17.3% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.8%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.80. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.84, reflecting an increase of $0.09 or 3.3% compared to the same quarter in 2023.\nIn Q4, there were approximately 57.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $130 million compared to $171 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was $115 million compared to free cash flow of $161 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which is lower compared to the same quarter last year due to our recently completed acquisitions.\nAt the end of Q4 DSO was 70 days compared to 74 days in Q3 2024 and 71 days in the same quarter last year. Share repurchases in the fourth quarter were approximately 53,000 shares for $13 million at an average price of $241.99 per share. Moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter.\nWe ended Q4 with more than 55,100 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a growth of 16.3% compared to Q4 of 2023. This was a result of recent acquisitions, which contributed nearly 6,000 delivery professionals. In addition to solid organic growth, which contributed sequential net additions of around 1,500 employees in the quarter, our total head count for the quarter was 61,200 employees. Utilization was 76.2% compared to 74.4% in Q4 of last year and 76.4% in Q3 2024.\nTurning to our 2024 full year results. Revenues for the year were $473 billion, up 0.8% on a reported basis year-over-year. On an organic constant currency basis, revenues were down 1.7% year-over-year. GAAP income from operations was $545 million, an increase of 8.6% year-over-year and represented 11.5% of revenue. GAAP income from operations benefited from the recognition of $69 million of incentives related to research and development activities performed in Poland and was negatively impacted by $31 million of severance-related costs.\nOur non-GAAP income from operations was $779 million, a growth of 1.8% compared to the prior year and represented 16.5% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations benefited from the recognition of $45 million of incentives related to research and development activities performed in Poland in 2024. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 22.2%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $7.84. Non-GAAP EPS which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and certain other onetime items, including costs associated with our cost optimization programs was $10.86, reflecting a 2.5% increase over fiscal 2023.\nIn 2024, there were approximately 58 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Cash flow from operations was $559 million compared to $563 million for 2023 and free cash flow was $527 million, reflecting 83.7% adjusted net income conversion. And finally, shares repurchased in 2024 were approximately 1,854,000 shares for $398 million at an average price of $214.65 per share.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2025 and Q1 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. We've been pleased with the progress we are making on demand generation, and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2025. We [ ceased building client budgets ] and some degree of shift in spending towards growth and strategic programs. In 2025, we expect flat year-over-year organic revenue growth in Q1, followed by continued improvement throughout the year. In terms of profitability for 2025, we do expect to run the business at somewhat lower levels of profitability than we have in past years.\nAs Ark mentioned, we are investing in retaining our top talent as well as further accelerating investments in our advanced GenAI platforms and tools. Compensation increases to retain talent for future growth combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing in the near term and additional pressure from dilutive impact of recent acquisitions will continue to put pressure on profitability this year. However, we do expect to see improvement in our profitability levels from the first half to the second half of the year.\nOur guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2024. Now starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will be in the range of 10% to 14%, with an inorganic contribution of approximately 10% for 2025. Foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of 0.9%. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will also be 24%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $6.78 to $7.08 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10.45 to $10.75 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 58.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q1 of 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.275 billion to $1.290 billion, producing year-over-year growth of approximately 10%. Our guidance reflects an inorganic contribution of 11.4% with a 1.4% negative FX impact during the quarter.\nFor the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Our Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of resetting social security caps, the negative impact of 2024 compensation increases, which we were unable to offset with better pricing, dilution from recent acquisitions and a slightly softer revenue in the month of January as clients in certain verticals finalize budgets.\nFor the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Our Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of resetting social security caps, the negative impact of 2024 compensation increases, which we were unable to offset with better pricing dilution from recent acquisitions and slightly softer revenues in the month of January as clients in certain verticals finalized budgets.\nWe expect a weighted average share count of 57.7 million diluted shares outstanding. Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for 2025. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $194 million with $50 million in Q1, $44 million in Q2 and $50 million in each remaining quarter.\nAmortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $68 million for the year, with approximately $18 million in Q1 and $17 million in each remaining quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately $1 million loss each quarter. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be approximately $61 million for the year was $17 million in Q1, $14 million in Q2 and $15 million in each remaining quarter. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $14 million for the full year, with approximately $7 million in Q1, $2 million in Q2, $1 million in Q3 and $3 million in Q4.\nSeverance driven by our 2024 cost optimization program is expected to be $6 million in Q1 and $1 million in Q2. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items, we maintain a significant level of cash and are generating a healthy level of interest income. However, based on the reduction in cash resulting from the recent acquisitions, we are expecting interest and other income to be smaller in 2025 compared to 2024.\nWith around $18 million for the 2025 full year with $4 million in Q1 and Q2 and $5 million in each remaining quarter. My thanks to all the EPAMers who made 2024 a successful year, and will help us drive growth throughout 2025.\nOperator, let's open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI'd now like to welcome Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations to begin the conference. Mike, over to you.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Mike Rowshandel, Head of Investor Relations. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2024 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. First, I would like to start off with our second quarter results, which came generally in line with our expectations. We believe our performance in the second quarter of 2024 reflects our continued strong execution and adaptability amidst a still complex demand environment.\nLet me share some current highlights of our business from Q2 up to today. Our underlying business continues to show signs of stabilization. In the second quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our healthcare and life sciences vertical and strong growth in our emerging verticals, where we also saw some slight sequential improvements in financial services. In some of the verticals, namely business information and media, we continue to work through the impact of the rap-downs from the few large clients we have mentioned before.\nOn the demand environment, we do see broad-based signs of stabilization as well across both EMEA and North America. At the same time, clients are still cautious with larger programs and our visibility to a significant increase continues to be constrained by a mix of clients, cost-saving priorities, delays in program starts and clients' own business changes. As a result of this complex environment, we are currently assuming no net improvements in overall demand for the remainder of the year. Jason will provide more details of our updated outlook for 2024.\nTo be clear, notwithstanding the overall demand picture, we are optimistic about certain sectors of our target market and our current portfolio returning to modest growth story in the next 2, 3 quarters as we see it now. In overall, while we adjust our offerings and our delivery mix to see the parameters of the current demand environment, we continue to see significant traction in our data and analytics, core engineering and digital engagement [indiscernible], especially through the broad transformation of [indiscernible] with AI, as well as increasing agents that our consulting and advanced technology capabilities are driving new top of the final opportunities for us.\nSo meanwhile, we remain focused on responsibly managing our business in this part of the cycle, building on our strong fundamentals and ensuring that the EPAM continues to be the partners of choice while the demand environment improve.\nTurning now to our global delivery strategy. In Europe, our differentiated capabilities continue to create significant opportunities for our clients to leverage the top talent on their most complex business and technical challenges. We believe this traditional EPAM advantage will continue to serve our clients well, especially as a turn from mostly cost-driven considerations back toward driving growth and innovation through the use of advanced technologies for their complex transformation and modernization efforts.\nWe are also continuously investing in our more recently established delivery hubs across Western and Central Asia, which are emerging talent markets and where we are enabling strong and experienced tech talent to responsibly lead our future growth in the region.\nIndia remains a priority and is on track to becoming our largest delivery location by the end of the year. We have built scaled centers of excellence in data and analytics, digital marketing, commerce, sales force, SAP and other key horizontal and vertical service lines.\nOur primary focus is on building a scale, EPAM grade quality engineering, while blending in with many unique enterprise-level capabilities present in India and not available in most of other EPAM locations around the globe. We believe this approach will differentiate EPAM India our clients and create strong growth opportunities for our people.\nWe are also continuing to expand our core engineering capabilities in Lat Am. In addition to Mexico and Colombia, we now have a short delivery hub in Argentina. We will continue assessing and developing new local talents across the region.\nIn each of these years, we are investing in our existing and new technical capabilities, including crucial for the future GenAI data, ML and predictive AI and in corresponding IP development. In short, we are building full-service GenAI delivery practices through a network of GenAI x-labs across major debt centers to enable and scale GenAI-enabled client reduction activities.\nIn addition, both in India and Lat Am, we are evolving into strategies that includes not only differentiated delivery capabilities, but also being able to offer compelling in-market presence end solutions, particularly as we seek to serve our global [indiscernible] alliance in a more complete and strategic manner, which means building locally a much stronger partner ecosystem as well.\nFinally, in all our locations, and specifically in our major client markets, we continue to focus on our client engagement programs and to improve our consulting [indiscernible] industry capabilities across our service effects.\nNow let's turn in a bit more details on our GenAI approach. For the last decade and despite all challenges during the last several years, we are continuously a recognized leader in advanced technology, digital engineering and complete data transformation programs. This naturally extends to EPAM being regarded to the company who understands the complexities of AI transformation, something we are doing for ourselves, our partners and our clients for some time now.\nToday, I would like to highlight our up-to-date progress in that area and how EPAM is helping clients pragmatically initiate and then move use cases beyond pilots into production deployments.\nOur current approach to AI transformation is 3 dimensional/ Dimension one, EPAM internal transformation and GenAI enablement investments. We set an ambition goal for ourselves to upskill and effectively train an absolute majority of the company on the usage of GenAI fundamentals and to do so both responsibly and with the EPAM level technical debt. A dedicated program was established to execute this. And today, with the help of our educational platforms, internal specialized tools and our global maintaining community, close to 100% of the EPAMers have gone through training and applying AI in their daily work activities.\nWhile most of the companies have announced similar programs, we believe that during the last 24 months, our early and highly focused efforts across a broad range of EPAMers allow us to better understand future opportunities and to invest in differentiated IP and accelerators around GenAI enabled engineering solution.\nOur combination of training IP and open source style internal initiatives have now become drivers of scaling our advanced GenAI practitioner communities across all EPAM organizational unit and practices. We assume that well over 10% of EPAMers are now advanced generic technical practitioners, while over 1,000 are becoming strong internal AI Champions with ability to lead GenAI enabled business solutions.\nWe believe all that have enabled our dimension to client transformation opportunities. Our AI client project today have evolved from exploratory pilots and proof-of-concept late last year to now EPAM being selected by clients as a primary AI partner with involvement into hundreds of GenAI led engagements. We are helping to change the full value chain of HDLC from one side and enabling implementation of real GenAI-driven business use cases from another.\nLet me briefly highlight just a few IP investments. EPAM DIAL is a unified GenAI orchestration platform helping enterprises speed the experimentation and innovation efforts to implement real business use cases and GenAI enabled solutions by connecting into meaningful workflow and load balancing a set of public and proprietary LLMs and SLMs together with different type of internal, external data sources, AI native applications and customer dots.\nEPAM AI/Run is a GenAI power delivery framework that accelerates the entire software development life cycle and helps clients recognize ROI of the AI investments by improving time to market speed up to 30%. EPAM EliteA, a comprehensive collaboration platform for teams that streamline the development, accessibility and management of large language model assets, including prompts, templates and agents.\nNow a few specific examples for the clients, which operate across completely different user environments. For Unity, the world-leading platform of gaming tools for creators to build and grow real-time games apps and experiences across multiple platforms. We help build Unity use. From a multi-cloud migration to Microsoft Azure to aid in GenAI capabilities to make game creation faster and easier for 1 million developers by using natural language prompts to generate [indiscernible], textures and animations and also providing chat-based assistance and troubleshooting, as well as the ability to either create behavior [indiscernible].\nXsolis, a leader in health care system purpose-built solutions and industry-leading AI, will help to develop a new generation AI platform on AWS enhancing Dragonfly, Xsolis flagship product. The platform provides real-time data and predictive analytics to nurses, case managers, physician advisers, utilization management and revenue cycle leaders across 500 hospitals and health systems with more than 500 [indiscernible] connections.\nFinally, for the [indiscernible] as a part of modernization of the data platform, we built StatGPT, which is SDMX driven GenAI application for statistical organizations, relying their users, economists and statisticians to quality transform, analyze, visualize and interpret statistical data using a natural language interface via proprietary talk to data framework powered by EPAM DIAL and EPAM QuantHub accelerators. Initial results showed a 50% increase in research productivity and 35% increase in research accuracy.\nAnd overall, we are seeing a significant rise of GenAI engagements across every vertical and a very broad set of use cases. And this is now driving transformation in both front-end customer experiences as well as significant back-office and process-related use cases.\nFinally, all that in turn allow us to enable Dimension 3 for AI transformation, extended [indiscernible] network. First of all, because we saw that we are very practical in our approach. Our technology and AI transformation program are much larger and more complex today than where we started just a few quarters ago, and encompasses both consulting and engineering services as well as a broader range of partnerships.\nWith more than 150 strategic partners, we're accelerating modernization, adopting cloud native architecture and leveraging AI and advanced analytics, particularly when our clients projects have a high degree of technical and business complexity. We are our partners partner of choice for making corporate engagement real. In fact, just very recently, we've been named Partner of the Year by several of our cloud data and digital partners, including Data Brief disruption Partner of the Year, recognized for the industry-leading design and implementation of GenAI power conversational interfaces, state-of-the-art machine learning and large language model framework.\nBy the way, as elite level partner, we are 1 of only 5 companies with [indiscernible] data brick center of excellence. Google Cloud Talent Development Partner of the Year award recognized for our commitment to training, upskilling and reskilling our team, cloud and AI skills. Microsoft Gaming Partner of the Year recognized for the pushing the boundaries of creativity and technology. [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] tools recognized for delivery best-in-class modern commerce experience for our clients.\nIt's easy to assume the next question, what is the revenue impact of these programs? I guess the answer is probably predictable as well. We are still in early days of the AI wave. But at the same time, we are very optimistic about the accelerating pipeline opportunities coming from AI-led transformation and what that can bring downstream for us is a highly trusted and valid partner.\nWe remain focused on expanding our efforts to drive demand. Remaining relevant to our clients and what they need and proactively expanding our global market share. We also remain committed to managing our delivery footprint, expanding to cost-efficient locations and generally optimizing our ways of working, so we can continue to provide premium service at attractive value to our global client base.\nI firmly believe EPAM continues to be well positioned to capture rebound in market demand, driven by [indiscernible] pressures for legacy modernization with needs for advanced customer-centric solution and by significant interest on [indiscernible] how to apply GenAI and GenAI capabilities to build new platform and solutions.\nWith this, I would like to pass to Jason to provide additional details on our results in Q2 and our future performance.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.147 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 2% on [indiscernible] Russian market, we no longer generate revenue from Russian clients. The impact of this exit had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Moving to our vertical performance.\nLife Sciences & Healthcare delivered very strong year-over-year growth of 22.4%. Growth in the quarter was driven by clients in both Life Sciences & Healthcare. Consumer goods, retail and travel decreased 7.7% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel. Financial Services decreased 5.6% year-over-year, driven by softness in asset management, banking and payments.\nIn the quarter, the vertical delivered slight sequential growth, indicating stabilizing demand. Software and hi-tech contract to 3.7% year-over-year. Business information and media declined 12.6% compared to Q2 2023. Revenue in the quarter was substantially impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of the top 20 client. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid year-over-year growth of 10.6% driven by clients in energy and telecom.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 60% of our Q2 revenues, grew 1.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency terms. EMEA representing 38% of our Q2 revenues, contracted 6% year-over-year and 5.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC declined 0.6% year-over-year or 0.2% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. In Q2, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 3.7% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1.1%. The relatively stronger performance of this latter group was driven by both new client and inorganic revenue contributions.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.3% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.8% compared to 32.6% for the same quarter last year. Relative to Q2 2023, gross margin in Q2 2024 was negatively impacted by the strengthening of currencies associated with certain delivery locations as well as the impact of compensation increases, including those resulting from our recent promotion campaign, which we were not able to offset through pricing. The negative impact of foreign exchange and compensation increases exceeded the benefit of improved utilization.\nGAAP SG&A was 16.9% of revenue compared to 16.7% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q2 2024 came in at 14.3% of revenue compared to 14.8% in the same period last year. SG&A improvement in the quarter is the result of our ongoing focus on managing our cost base and increased efficiency in our spend. GAAP income from operations was $121 million or 10.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $144 million or 12.3% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $175 million or 15.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $191 million or 16.3% of revenue in Q2 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 26.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.3%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.70. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.45 compared to $2.64 in Q2 of last year, reflecting a $0.19 decrease year-over-year. EPS was positively impacted by a Serbian government investment incentive received and recognized in the quarter, which improved Q2 diluted EPS by $0.06, although the benefit from this incentive was contemplated in the full year guidance communicated during our Q1 earnings call. At that time, we had expected to receive the incentive and recognize the benefit in Q3. In Q2, there were approximately 58.1 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $57 million compared to $89 million in the same quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was $52 million compared to free cash flow of $82 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q2, DSO was 76 days and compares to 73 days for Q1 2024 and 71 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments, combined with the last few days of the quarter falling on a weekend.\nShare repurchases in the second quarter were approximately 1.16 million shares for 214 million at an average price of $184.97 per share. In June 2024, EPAM completed the share repurchase program authorized on February 13, 2023. Over a period of 16 months, 2.24 million shares were repurchased at an average share price of $222.9.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to another $500 million of EPAM common stock over a term of 24 months. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q2 with more than 47,000 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, a decline of 4.8% compared to Q2 2023. Sequentially, production head count remained unchanged as the company reduced head count in certain on-site locations, while continuing to hire in India. Our total head count for the quarter was more than 52,650 employees. Utilization was 77.5% compared to 75.1% in Q2 of last year and 76.8% in Q1 2024. However, on-site utilization remains below targeted levels and the company will continue to take actions to optimize on-site resource levels to improve utilization.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. Although client demand has stabilized, we continue to see very little improvement in the near-term demand environment. We are experiencing growth in certain verticals seeing relatively high levels of new logo activity and working with clients to bring GenAI programs into production.\nWe are also beginning to see some constructive improvement in client discussions with regards to future programs. But decision-making continues to be relatively cautious as some clients continue to have challenges with their own end markets and revenue generated by individual new logo accounts is on average less than that generated in prior years.\nAlthough we believe clients are beginning to more actively engage around new initiatives, our guidance assumes macroeconomic stability with no improvement in the aggregate demand environment for the remainder of the year. We are hopeful that change in the tone of client conversations will result in an improved demand environment in 2025.\nFor the remainder of 2024, we are expecting a slight increase in Q3 revenue relative to Q2, driven by greater build-outs in the quarter, substantially offset by higher vacation levels. We are expecting a modest sequential decline in Q4 revenues, driven largely by some of the seasonal factors mentioned previously. We are maintaining our focus on demand generation and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth for the remainder of 2024. At the same time, we are taking steps to improve cost efficiency and on-site utilization and now expect to operate at a higher level of profitability in the fiscal year.\nFinally, our operations in Ukraine continue to run at high levels of utilization, a testament to our team's dedication and focus on maintaining uninterrupted quality of delivery. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at the productivity levels similar to levels achieved in 2023.\nMoving to our full year outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.590 to $4.625 billion, a negative growth rate of 1.8% at the midpoint of the range. The impact of foreign exchange rate growth is expected to have a positive impact of approximately 10 basis points. At this time, we expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution from already completed acquisitions.\nWe expect GAAP income operations to now be in the range of 10.5% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 15.5% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to now be 21%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%. For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.18 to $7.38 for the full year. and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.20 to $10.40 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 57.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q3 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion to $1.155 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 0.2% at the midpoint of the range. And on a constant currency basis, we expect Q3 revenue to be flat year-over-year. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.83 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.73 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 57.4 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $45 million for each of the next 2 quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Severance driven by our cost optimization program is expected to be around $10 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nFinally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items, with our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be approximately $13 million for each of the remaining quarters. While we work our way through this cycle of lower demand, we will continue to run EPAM efficiently, positioning the company to capitalize on a more normalized demand environment.\nLastly, my continued thanks to all our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM. Operator, let's open the call up for questions."

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2024 EPAM Systems Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. First about our guidance change. As you saw from our press release, we are seeing some continuing volatility in our global demand environment. And while there are encouraging signs of new deals and new types of very different domain-specific demands, then even in cyclical nature of 2023 follow us well in 2024, which now leads us to adjust our thinking for both Q2 and for all full year outlook.\nAs I mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call, our initial view was the 2024 environment will be, at least for the first half of the year, a continuation of second part of 2023's trends with a potential demand upturn right after, and that will take us into sequential growth for 2024. This view, which we now believe was optimistic, was supported by broadly anticipated more positive macro assumptions and our active interactions with the clients during the very end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024.\nThat was directing our belief that clients will more quickly come back to growth in the -- for the remainder of 2024. We also believe that once we enter into Q2, we would have much more measurable indicators for the improvements of the demand environment for digital engineering, data, cloud and AI and from which we can build further out 2024 revenue scenarios and plans.\nWhat we now understand is that the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that continue to drive volatility in overall markets and specifically in the IT services and digital transformation sectors are still with us throughout the reminder of the year. While the programs we anticipated to start by now are still in place, and some are in active discussions, many of them have been postponed to future periods or decided to be implemented in much more modest scopes.\nIn addition, we need for rebalancing our delivery platform to lower cost locations for some level of slowdown in our revenue growth, too. And so our expectation for considerably high level accelerated revenue trends in second part of the year will not be materializing as we anticipated, at least as we see it now.\nJason will provide more details in our updated outlook for 2024, but let me share some current highlights of our business from Q1 up to today. Throughout the last quarter, and continuing into now, we've been making progress across all critically important areas for us, which were discussed in depth during our previous call. We are strengthening and repositioning our Italian delivery platform as well as the cost effectiveness of our offerings by rebalancing our Italian distribution from more expensive locations to less expensive ones while maintaining our commitment to our traditionally strong years.\nIndia, our second-largest delivery location is growing rapidly, not only in terms of headcount, but also by creating new capability centers in data, cloud, digital transformation and AI-enabled managed services. We recently opened our [ Gurugram ] office and plan to open additional locations to support our client growing needs.\nLATAM is another of our stated priorities in overall rebalancing. As we refine and expand our locations there, we're expanding our key engineering DNA capabilities and the vision. In the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of [ Wates ], a multi-award winning software development company with offices in Argentina and Chile. We are continuously investing in our existing and new technical capabilities including crucial for the future GenAI, data and ML and predictive AI and corresponding IP development. We also continued to improve our domain industry capabilities in consulting and advisory services.\nDuring the beginning of 2024, we have seen encouraging signs of -- balance demand environment across our business with both new and existing logos, equally weighted between cost takeout and business change and modernization. This portfolio-wide perspective, combined with our efforts to establish domain specific and relevant approaches for go-to-market, both independently and with our partners, leads us to believe that our ongoing reinvestment in consulting experience, cloud data, AI and vertical-led solutions will provide the unique age we need to secure a long-term growth.\nCouple short stories to illustrate above. EPAM recently came up with AWS health and a leading energy company in the U.K. to transform its customer experience, respondent to a market that is characterized by the need for enhanced customer expectations, emerging competitors, regulatory demands, smart metering adoption and sustainability growth. Our engagement was built around key transformations of payment channels, customer service frameworks and shift to agile processes to ensure service flexibility.\nFor a new logo, one of the world's best known global car rental brands, we are helping to redesign a critical data platform that will enhance intelligent real-time pricing capabilities and drive better experiences for customers and further increasing the pricing market leadership. We believe it is the next iteration of platform engineering in a truly intelligent application empowered by AI that will drive the future of our demand.\nFinally, and another encouraging sign, our long-term clients are also returning to us with newer streams related to modernization and next-gen support, which now include much expanded engagement footprint with larger shares of India and Latin America, including net new delivery locations in Argentina and Brazil.\nIn general, our focus on domain-led propositions is the reason we believe we saw much stronger growth in some verticals last quarter. For example, in our healthcare and life science portfolio, we are part of a number of strategic programs helping clients in areas of cloud data platform, physical digital product development and engineering as well as a new GenAI-driven initiatives.\nOn the other side, in some of our verticals, namely business information and media, we continue to work through the impact of rundowns from a few large clients initiated previously. And while we aren't able yet to offset this revenue coming from new opportunities, we are still seeing a more balanced picture emerging over the course of the next quarters.\nAcross all our verticals and geos, we are seeing more interest and higher level of program starts related to generative AI. In Q1, a number of our key clients formerly selected to EPAM strategic partners for the AI transformation joins, where EPAM helped to scale AI, including GenAI to unlock the power of data and to establish valuable insights. These engagements are often starting today from advisory and from the use of our differentiating IP and then ramping up to specific use cases. We believe that will lead us to a new level of engagement with our buyers by allowing to drive meaningful business breakthroughs with our tools and in combination with our consulting and scale delivery capabilities. And while the revenue impact of these programs is still limited today, we see it's a very visible progression of the AI-enabled services market for us.\nTo summarize, while in Q1, across our core business, we are seeing a more balanced demand outlook and in the most part of 2023 -- return to modernization and business change programs as well as a ramping up GenAI-related opportunities, as mentioned already today. By the end of Q1, we realized that the speed and scale of those changes were not in line with our earlier expectations.\nMoving to how we imagine our business in this part of the cycle. As we focus on driving new demand and proactively -- and expanding our wallet share with clients, we're also looking for opportunities to drive efficiency and focus throughout the organization. We have shared our ongoing efforts to rebalance the business from a geographical perspective over the course of last year, and that program is ongoing.\nOur intention now is tilting starting towards a more fine-tuned approach to both geographic investment as well as our areas of capability and market, particularly around our stated market segments, AI cloud, data experience and -- consulting.\nWe've gone to market in much more intentional way with key -- and strategic partners, and are now looking to refine some of those propositions and investment as we look to balance near-term, long-term demand with our investments. Throughout the remainder of this year, we will be focusing on driving enhanced efficiency and further rebalancing of our geographical footprint -- portions of our in market and some other teams, enhancing operational efficiencies and engineering productivity through application of AI and automation internally at EPAM and driving a singular focus on client centricity for the entire company.\nThose continual efforts are critically important as we navigate the current environment while taking the necessary steps for the eventual return for build and transform programs, which have been slowed down during the last 2 years.\nOur fundamentals are strong, and we are fully confident that EPAM will be in a lead position in this rebound, enabled by our significantly diversified global delivery platform and driven by long-term pressures for legacy modernization, needs for advanced customer-centric solutions and the significant interest in applying and integrating GenAI and GenAI capabilities into new and existing enterprise platforms, innovative intelligent applications and new transformative business models.\nWith that, let me pass to Jason to provide details on our Q1 results and our guidance for 2024.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.165 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 3.8% on a reported basis or 4.3% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 50 basis points. Due to our exit from the Russian market, we will longer generate revenue from Russian clients. The impact of this exit had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year rev growth. Excluding Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.\nMoving to our vertical performance. Life sciences and healthcare delivered very strong year-over-year growth of 26%. Growth in the quarter was driven by clients in both life sciences and healthcare.\nTo reflect a more diverse end market, our travel and consumer vertical has been renamed consumer goods, retail and travel. On a year-over-year basis, the vertical decreased 6.9%, largely due to declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel. Sequentially, the vertical grew modestly driven by solid sequential growth in the travel portion of the portfolio.\nsoftware and hi-tech contracted 8.3% year-over-year and grew 2.6% on a sequential basis, suggesting some level of stability in the vertical.\nFinancial services decreased [ 10.3% ] year-over-year, driven by declines in banking, asset management and the payment sector.\nBusiness information and media declined 15.8% compared to Q1 in 2023. Revenue in the quarter was substantially impacted by the previously discussed ramp down of the top 20 client. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid year-over-year growth of 12.9%, driven by clients in energy and telecom.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q1 revenues, declined 2.4% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Sequentially, growth was 2.4%, reflecting ongoing signs of stabilization in the geography. EMEA representing 39% of our Q1 revenues contracted 3.2% year-over-year and 4.8% in constant currency. And finally, APAC declined 13.1% year-over-year or 11.5% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenue. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp-down of work within our financial services vertical.\nIn Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 8.6% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1%. The relatively stronger performance of this latter group was driven by both new logo revenue and inorganic revenue contributions.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.3% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.4% compared to 31.5% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q1 2024 was negatively impacted by foreign exchange due to strengthening of currencies in certain of our delivery locations. Additionally, the [ inability ] to adjust prices after EPAM's Q2 2023 promotion campaign continues to have a negative impact on profitability.\nGAAP SG&A was 17% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q1 2024 came in at 14.1% of revenue compared to 15.3% in the same period last year. SG&A improvement in the quarter is a result of our ongoing focus on managing our cost base and increasing efficiency in our spend. GAAP income from operations was $111 million or 9.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $120 million or 9.9% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $174 million or 14.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $178 million or 14.7% of revenue in Q1 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 6%, which included a higher level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.4%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.97. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.46 compared to $2.47 in Q1 of last year, reflecting a $0.01 decrease year-over-year. In Q1, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $130 million compared to $87 million in the same quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operations in the quarter reflected a lower level of variable compensation payout related to 2023. Free cash flow was $123 million compared to free cash flow of $79 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q1, DSO was 73 days compared to 71 days for Q4 2023 and 69 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments.\nShare repurchases in the first quarter were approximately 396,000 shares for $121 million at an average price of $304.21 per share. As of March 31, we had approximately $214 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q1 with more than 47,050 consultants, designers, engineers and architects, a decline of 8% compared to Q1 2023. This is the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 52,800 employees. Utilization was 76.8% compared to 74.9% in Q1 of last year, and 74.4% in Q4 2023.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. We are continuing to see a modest improvement in demand. However, client decision-making continues to be cautious and demand is not improving to the degree expected when we set our original 2024 guidance. At that time, based on the modest sequential growth achieved in Q4 2023 and our forecast of modest growth in Q1, we expect Q2 to show flat to modest sequential improvement, followed by solid sequential growth averaging at least 3% for Q3 and Q4. As a reminder, based on the sequential declines in 2023 quarterly revenue, we needed to generate regular sequential growth in 2024 to produce year-over-year growth.\nFor the remainder of the year, with limited demand improvement, we now expect seasonal factors to have a more pronounced impact on sequential revenue growth with Q2 showing a modest decline, Q3 improving followed by flat to a possible modest decline in revenues in Q4. Additionally, although we are seeing some modest incremental contribution to revenue from recently completed acquisitions, that contribution is largely offset by foreign exchange headwinds, resulting in the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar.\nWe're maintaining our focus on demand generation and will continue to prioritize revenue growth throughout 2024. In 2024, we will incur incremental costs related to compensation. Additionally, lower utilization for EPAM's end market resources and some ongoing pricing pressure will continue to negatively impact gross margins. However, we are committed to running the business at a profitability level of at least 15% for non-GAAP adjusted IFO. We are planning to initiate additional cost savings measures to ensure that we can achieve our profit objectives while still focusing on long-term growth.\nFinally, our operations in Ukraine continue to run at high levels of utilization, a testament to our team's dedication and focus on maintaining uninterrupted quality of delivery. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to levels achieved in 2023.\nMoving to our -- outlook. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.575 billion to $4.675 billion, a negative growth rate of 1.4% at the midpoint of the range. The impact of foreign exchange on growth is now expected to have a negative impact of approximately 30 basis points. At this time, we expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution from already completed acquisitions. We expect GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 10% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 15% to 15.5%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be 20%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will continue to be 24%. Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.34 to $7.64 for the full year, and we are focused on maintaining non-GAAP diluted EPS, so as to remain in the range of $10 to $10.03 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 58.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q2 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.145 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 2.6% at the midpoint of the range with the expected impact of foreign exchange to be negative 0.6%. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. We expect GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nEarnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.52 to $1.60 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.29 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $38 million for Q2, $46 million for Q3 and $47 million for Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $10 million for Q2 and $11 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1 million for Q2 and $1.7 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nWe expect incremental restructuring charges in the second half of 2024 and at this time, cannot estimate the amounts with reasonable certainty. We expect to provide detailed estimates during our Q2 call. Incremental restructuring charges are currently not included in our guidance. However, these charges will not impact our non-GAAP results.\nFinally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be approximately $15 million for Q2, $20 million for Q3 and $15 million for Q4. While we work our way through the cycle of lower demand, we will continue to run EPAM efficiently, positioning the company to capitalize on a more normalized demand environment.\nLastly, my continued thanks to all of our employees for their dedication and focus on serving our clients and driving results for EPAM.\nOperator, let's open the call up for questions."

I would like to welcome everyone to the EPAM Systems Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. If you have not, copies available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind those listening to some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As usual, in Q1, it's time for us to reflect on the past 12 months and share what we think about the next 12. Before I do that, I want to thank our team around the world for their dedication to our clients and hard work throughout last year, and for staying committed and engaged in the work ahead of us in 2024.\nLooking back to 2023. I will start from a short summary, very much in line with what we shared in today's press release. We believe that EPAM performance in 2023 reflects our ability to navigate volatile demand, both simultaneously and simultaneously, the keyword here [indiscernible] by both geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions.\nAfter rebalancing most of our delivery Italian footprint across Europe, Western and Central Asia, India and Latin America and refining our go-to-market approach to meet current demand, we are now focused primarily on harmonizing our delivery quality, optimizing cost effectiveness and proactively leveraging our extensive advanced technology and growing consulting capabilities to catalyze on Gen AI and AI-driven opportunities of the future.\nIn that context, first a few notes on 2023 and their relevance to 2024, and then I can move on aspects of our 2024 outlook. Let me start from geopolitical and economic impacts and [indiscernible] operations. In February of 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it necessary for us to relocate over 13,000 people plus families to new geographies. While most of these relocations completed back in 2022, many adjustments did happen last year. And still today, in 2024, we will continue to work on some downstream factors, including [ seniority pyramid, ] team composition and cost effectiveness across our traditional and new locations.\nI want to also especially recognize our team in Ukraine, who prove that despite the level of challenges they accepted, a reliable partner for our clients, existing and new ones.\nA few additional notes on reposition and stabilization of our [ Italian ] delivery platform. As mentioned already, 2023 was a year of significant rebalancing for most of our global delivery. We work on scale in India and Lat Am and at the same time, preparing for future growth in development centers across Europe and Western and Central Asia, our key destination for majority of our [indiscernible] Italian.\nIn 2023, India continued to be our fastest-growing location, practically since 2021. And while we are growing our capabilities there with accelerated speed, we also worked to ensure that our delivery culture remains focused on quality and client value. India will likely become our largest location by the end of 2024 or at least on [indiscernible] with our current scale in Ukraine.\nLatin America, specifically our locations in Colombia and Mexico, [indiscernible] maturing significantly as we scale out our cloud and data capabilities there to be prepared to meet rising demand from North American clients.\nAnd so we are starting 2024 from significantly refractory geographic delivery platform, much more balanced than ever to bring together the practices, methods and collaborative ways of working, and to focus on harmonizing our engineering competencies and critical capabilities in cloud, data and now in AI, to be present now in each of our strategic locations. In 2024, this is one of our key priorities, and we expect these programs to be continuous areas of investment and differentiation for EPAM.\nAs we mentioned in previous calls, there is a growing number of clients, who, after slowing their spending results due to the war, have started to grow the engagement with us again, but utilizing our much more diverse geographic footprint and advanced delivery capabilities. Supporting this trend will be another key priority, as we continue during 2024 to build up our capabilities, both geographically and from our services mix perspective.\nTo illustrate some relevant specific efforts, I will share several ongoing investments in engineering [indiscernible] journeys, [indiscernible], covering standard copilots and other AI engineering productivity tools for all key delivery roles with specific adoption targets being set up for all locations.\nThis tool was released in 2023, with upgrades coming in Q1 and beyond. New upgrades to our digital delivery platform, now AI enabled and leveraging a set of composable assets that include upon proprietary, together with open source components and tools to connect to a variety of [indiscernible] for supporting the most critical capabilities, protecting private data and fronting cost-effective and reliable consumption for external [indiscernible] platform.\nFinally, productivity measurement framework, allowing [ tailoring ] of engineering commercial base practices for continuous improvements of individual and team productivity and AI-assisted development environment.\nAll those efforts should make it possible for us to become the most geographically diverse and broadly AI-assisted deliver [indiscernible] platforms in the industry.\nNow about cost-effectiveness. It became obvious at the end of 2022, throughout 2023, that to [indiscernible] current economic environment, we must continuously consider cost optimization efforts to react properly to all changes around us.\nSome targeted optimization efforts were ongoing in 2023 across the board, in market and global delivery locations. This has improved our utilization in the short term and allow us to fund several initiatives in 2023, in 2024. We will be considering similar efforts as appropriate in the future to ensure our adaptability needs. We are also actively working on rebalancing our seniority permits we're engaging and training junior talent, while improving overall seniority in market and across our key global practices.\nAbout AI and Gen AI efforts. For years, we have been investing and scaling our data ML and predictive AI capabilities. Today, many of our clients are engaging us to do the foundational engineering and data ML work required to help them operate their current businesses, but also to enable them to start the work with generative AI.\nSince mid of last year, a majority of these are relatively small, reengaging over 400 Gen AI related projects. Our coverage of use cases is broad, from knowledge management to [indiscernible], from product management to supply chain and service optimization, from advanced business process redesign to new interactive agents development, from engineering productivity enhancements by using Gen AI tools to improving speed and quality of cogeneration in testing.\nLast year, we launched DIAL, our enterprise level orchestration platform to accelerate development of Gen AI empowered business solutions. Recently, we released for open source.\nWe are encouraged by seeing a high level of interest from our clients expressed in over 60 test [indiscernible], with 15 active projects in progress right now, and some already in production implementations across a tech insurance, retail, automotive, life science and business information vertical segments.\nOne of the most interesting deployment was done for major global economic data institution, and one of the most rewarding has been now work in Ukraine on famous [indiscernible] platform, which now includes Gen AI and AI capabilities as well.\nNow let's talk about demand environment. In 2023, we have managed to safeguard many of our programs and clients' portfolios. We also saw some pullback in spend last year, and expect that this may continue to be factored into 2024, as our clients execute vendor consolidation exercises to manage their costs.\nWhile this trend continues and in some cases, to our benefit, we are seeing encouraging signals of a general rebound for built-based solutions and for traditionally strong [indiscernible] capabilities and advanced tech data experience consulting in AI.\nTo capitalize on potential new demand, we are expanding our new business initiatives by enhancing our sales strategies and go-to-market partnerships, dedicated resources to create new [indiscernible], establish new engagement models and innovating our customer interaction method.\nIn 2023, it was also evident that we brought new clients at a rate higher than the previous years, and we plan to do it again in 2024.\nStill in overall, we believe, at this point, the 2024 environment will be, at least for the first half of the year, a continuation of second part of 2023 trends. The potential demand up towards the second half.\nWhile we have made significant progress on involving our operations and despite the challenges we have faced in 2023, our workers' clients has been increasingly recognized by leading analysts, and provide and turn some independent support for the stories we shared. All the reports are very recent, last 2, 3 months, and present the up-to-date [indiscernible] EPAM.\nAbout some new capabilities. In November 2023, EPAM was future by Gartner and competitive landscape, IT service providers to the global insurance industry report. That is probably one of the first recognition by Gartner of our industry expertise and a result of our efforts to bring insurance consultancy and implementation services simultaneously for the clients' benefits.\nPutting together insurance consulting advisory practice was one of the key effort for us during the last few years. Similar efforts today are underway in health care and life sciences, retail and distribution, oil and gas demand, if you ask.\nIn Q4 2023, EPAM was featured in [indiscernible] report, the cybersecurity consulting services landscape Q4 2023. EPAM was highlighted as 1 of the top 33 cybersecurity consulting services providers, which is probably first recognition of a critical capability we are developing for the last years.\nNow about some established capabilities, which were conformed recently. In November 2023, EPAM was recognized as the top 3 companies in [indiscernible] Quadrant for critical capabilities for customer software development services worldwide by Gartner. EPAM leadership and strengths were specifically highlighted in leveraging Gen AI, pioneering [indiscernible] and providing superior customer support and unique user experience.\nIn November, December 2023, IDC named EPAM as a leader in 3 reports. IDC MarketScape for worldwide experience design services vendor assessment. IDC MarketScape for worldwide experience built services vendor assessment. And as you see MarketScape for Worldwide Software Engineering Services [indiscernible] assets.\nFinally, [indiscernible] recognized EPAM as the #6 largest agencies in the United States and #18 in the world's largest agencies companies categories. In just 7 years, EPAM has moved from #130 to #6 among U.S. agencies.\nBefore I hand over the call to Jason, I would like to take a moment to share a couple of points on some aspects of our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. In 2023, we generated $4.69 billion in revenues, reflecting [indiscernible] of 2.8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exiting our Russian operations, revenue declined 1.8%. Adjusted income from operations was 16.3% of revenue and above the midpoint of our initial guided range.\nAlso, the current market conditions don't represent at all an ideal demand environment for EPAM. Our 2023 results highlight our commitment to adapting the company, to [indiscernible] the current circumstances while continuously preparing for the more beneficial for demand environment in the future.\nWhat I want to point out as well is that our Q4 results shows a sequential revenue growth, first time after 3 previous quarters of sequential declines.\nAbout 2024 outlook. Because of our ability to adapt to new client demands and market conditions, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us towards the end of 2024.\nDemand to build postponed during the last 2 years should rebound, driven by long-term pressures for legacy modernizations, by needs for advanced customer-centric solutions and by the massive interest to understand how to apply Gen AI and general AI capabilities to build new platforms and solutions.\nEven while we continue to navigate current economic and geopolitical environment carefully, we will invest in strategic initiatives organically and with support of expanded M&A activities, in demand generation efforts and in people programs. This will have some effect on our profitability in 2024, but we believe this is the right actions to ensure long-term growth and stronger market position.\nLet me turn the call over to Jason to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results, in addition to our initial view of 2024 expectations.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.16 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6% on a reported basis and a 7.3% decrease in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 130 basis points. The reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 70 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. The modest sequential growth in the quarter was the result of stabilizing demand. Revenues in Q4 were higher than we expected when we said Q4 guidance, due to both stronger client demand and significant benefit from favorable foreign exchange.\nBeginning with our industry verticals. Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 11.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in Life Sciences.\nTravel and Consumer decreased 4.4%, with solid growth in travel and hospitality, offset by declines in revenues derived from consumer goods and retail customers.\nFinancial Services contracted 7.1%, driven by declines in banking, partially offset by work performed from Marketplace exchange and finance information and analytics clients.\nExcluding the impact of the exit of our Russian operations, revenue on a year-over-year basis declined 5.5%.\nBusiness information and media declined 14.8% in the quarter. Revenues in the quarter continue to be impacted primarily by a reduction in spend across a number of large clients, due to uncertainty in their end markets, particularly in the mortgage data space.\nSoftware and Hi-Tech declined 16.8% in the quarter. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the reduction in revenue from our former top 20 client we mentioned during our previous earnings calls and generally slower growth in revenues across the range of customers in the vertical.\nAnd finally, our emerging verticals delivered growth of 4.2%, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and education.\nFrom a geographic perspective, the Americas, our largest region representing 58% of our Q4 revenues, declined 7.6% year-over-year or 7.7% in constant currency. On a sequential basis, growth remained relatively flat, consistent with the previous quarter.\nEMEA, representing 39% of our Q4 revenues, was flat year-over-year and declined 3.5% in constant currency. APAC declined 10.9% in both reported and constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. And finally, CEE, representing 0.1% of our Q4 revenues, contracted 91.6% year-over-year or 91.3% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by the exit of our operations in Russia.\nGoing forward, I will no longer comment on the CEE region and our quarterly prepared remarks, given that its revenue contribution is immaterial relative to our total revenues.\nIn Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 5% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 contracted 7%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 32.4% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33% compared to 34.1% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q4 2022 was positively impacted by the timing of year-end revenue recognition.\nGAAP SG&A was 18.5% of revenue compared to 16.6% in Q4 of last year. GAAP SG&A in the quarter was impacted by onetime charges, including expenses associated with the company's cost optimization program.\nNon-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.2% of revenue compared to 14.8% in the same period last year. SG&A expense for Q4 2023 reflects some cost efficiencies achieved in the quarter, as well as lower variable compensation compared to Q4 2022.\nGAAP income from operations was $122 million or 10.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $170 million or 13.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP from operations was $200 million or 17.3% of revenue in the quarter compared to $220 million or 17.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 23.4% versus our Q4 guide of 24%, due to greater-than-expected excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher state taxes and the impact of losses in certain non-U.S. acquired subsidiaries. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which includes the impact of state [indiscernible] subsidiary losses and excludes excess tax benefits, was 25.1%.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.66. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.75, reflecting a decrease of $0.18 or 6.1% compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q4, there were approximately $58.9 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $171 million compared to $186 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $161 million compared to free cash flow of $165 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nAt the end of Q4, DSO was 71 days and compares to 73 days in Q3 2023, and 70 days in the same quarter last year.\nShare repurchases in the fourth quarter were approximately 143,000 shares for $36.5 million, at an average price of $255.96 per share. As of December 31, we had approximately $335 million of share repurchase authority remaining.\nNow moving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 47,350 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a decline of 10.4% compared to Q4 2022. This is the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition, as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total head count for the quarter was more than 53,150 employees.\nUtilization was 74.4% compared to 73.6% in Q4 of last year and 72.7% in Q3 2023.\nTurning to our full year results for 2023. Revenues for the year were $4.69 billion, producing a decline of 2.8% reported, and a decline of 3.4% in constant currency terms compared to 2022. Excluding Russia revenues, the reported year-over-year growth rate would have been negative 1.8% reported and negative 2.4% in constant currency terms.\nGAAP income from operations was $501 million, a decrease of 12.5% year-over-year and represented 10.7% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $765 million, a decrease of 6.5% compared to the prior year and represented 16.3% of revenue.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 22.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7%.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $7.06. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and certain other onetime items, including costs associated with our cost optimization program, was $10.59, reflecting a 2.8% decrease over fiscal 2022.\nIn 2023, there were approximately 59.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nCash flow from operations was $563 million compared to $464 million for 2022. And free cash flow was $534 million, reflecting an 85.4% adjusted net income conversion.\nAnd finally, share repurchases in 2023 were approximately 686,000 shares for $164.9 million at an average price of $240.49 per share.\nOur 2023 results reflect EPAM's ability to manage the business through challenging macro conditions, while positioning the company for the return to a more normalized demand environment.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Before moving to the specifics of our 2024 and Q1 outlook, I would like to provide some thoughts to help frame our guidance. As Ark mentioned, the demand environment remains uneven and we believe this will persist at least in the first half of 2024. We have been pleased with the progress we are making on demand generation, and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2024, which, in some pursuits, include some degree of discounting.\nIn 2024, we expect to incur incremental costs due to more normalized variable compensation levels, in addition to wage inflation in certain geographies. This higher level of compensation, combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing in the near term, will continue to put pressures on margins in 2024.\nFinally, despite the war, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels similar to those achieved in 2023.\nNow starting with the full year outlook. Revenue growth will be in the range of 1% to 4%, on both a reported and constant currency basis. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible. At this time, we expect a nominal revenue contribution from inorganic revenue for 2024.\nLastly, we are seeing some improvement of demand, but the visibility for the year is still limited. Although we are guiding to modest sequential growth in Q1, increases in demand may not sufficiently offset revenue impacts resulting from seasonality in all quarters in 2024.\nWe expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, will be 24%.\nEarnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $7.20 to $7.60 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10 to $10.40 for the full year.\nWe expect weighted average share count of 59.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nFor Q1 of 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of approximately 4%, with the expected impact of FX to be minimal.\nFor the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9% to 10%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%.\nOur Q1 income from operations guide reflects the impact of the resetting of social security caps, normalized variable compensation and somewhat higher bench levels, where we expect to see improvement throughout the year.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 24%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.79 to $1.87 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.34 for the quarter.\nWe expect a weighted average share count of 59.1 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements for 2024. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $198 million, with $44 million in Q1, $48 million in Q2 and $53 million in each remaining quarter.\nAmortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $26 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1 million loss for each of the quarters.\nTax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be approximately $46 million for the year, with $11 million in Q1, $11 million in Q2 and $12 million in each remaining quarter.\nWe expect excess tax benefits to be around $28 million for the full year, with approximately $17 million in Q1, $5 million in Q2 and $3 million in each remaining quarter.\nFinally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. Our growing cash reserves are generating interest income, and EPAM is receiving governmental incentives from several countries in which we establish delivery operations. As a result, in 2024, we are anticipating an increased level of other income. We expect interest and other income to be around $66 million for the full year, with $16 million in Q1, $20 million in Q2 and $15 million in each remaining quarter.\nMy thanks to all the [ EPAMers ] who made 2023 a successful year, and will help us drive growth throughout 2024.\nOperator, let's open the call up for questions."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to EPAM's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadly Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into results of our third quarter, I would like to recap what was certain in regards to our expectations for Q3 and full year outlook 3 months ago during our last call. We stated that while the current business environment is more focused on cost optimization versus our differentiated build and deploy in. We do believe the demand for transformers and services will come back under the services market. you'll be moving from core IT to accelerated digitization to reinvent into our business models and ways of working with generate at the core of the transformation.\nAnd that we expect this new demand to be underpinned and even more driven exactly by our traditionally strong product platform engineering, data analytics and AI [ ML ] capabilities. At the same term, we said we still expect the negative dynamic to continue into second part of 2023. Here [ when the ] outlook begins to normalize.\nWe stated that we are focusing on to dine experience from very challenging part waters into pragmatic plans and action items, which will be applied to our business throughout the rest of '23 and into 2024. These changes are transformational for us. and already better positioning us in preparation for the return of strong market demand. That was the first part of our premise.\nThe second critical part was about our efforts to further globalize and stabilize our delivery ecosystem, propagate [indiscernible] engineering quality standards and optimize operationally our Italian allocations while closely focusing on our gross margin improvement efforts. We also continue throughout the remainder of this year, and I expect it to go throughout 2024.\nSo with that reminder, let's talk about 3 key topics to address our demand environment, global capabilities and key investments. Demand, we believe that while the demand for the new build for platform application remains lower than historic levels and the impact of ramp-downs in the quarters continue to work through specific client portfolios. [indiscernible] results point to sign of stabilization in our business, both in new logos and in retail and expanded programs in our existing portfolio, we are seeing signs of renewed interest. Particularly in our life science and hot car verticals, both in insurance and energy and not on there.\nWhat is important to highlight in today's business environment, we are putting all possible efforts to address our client current priorities, including addressing the mix of engagement models, cost takeouts and consolidation initiatives while protecting our share of wallet and long-term relationships. While these factors are leading sometimes to likely lower short-term profitability metrics, we are seeing signs that clients are returning to balance between cost and quality and the pump continues to be well positioned there.\nAlso, it required an increased focus on demand-led sales and go-to-market motions and investments in global partnerships to win and quickly growing new business. Over the last quarter, our global field organizations and our specialized practice teams are focused on developing new offerings in key verticals and horizontals, expand into new engagement models and extending our client portfolio to include new logos across the broader structure of our brands from large enterprises to mid-market players to new and exciting start-ups in key [ larger ] verticals. And more and more often, we are engaging with clients at a [ C level ] of both IT and business functions. One of the examples of those relatively new for us ways to engage is strengthening our partnerships, which have taken on a greater momentum recently with key collaborations driving net new go-to-market propositions, new IP and new client wins.\nLast quarter, we [ shared our ] global partnership with Google Cloud to help our clients fast track the development of facial intelligence, machine learning and data solutions to help them accelerate their transformation into AI-enabled business. Earlier this week, we are announcing [ standing ] strategic collaboration agreement with AWS. This will aim to accelerate modernization, adapt cloud-native architecture and leverage artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to create customer value in key industries such as health care, life science, financial services, insurance, energy and [ gaming ]. Furthermore, we expanded our partnership with Microsoft becoming a globally managed enterprise system integrator The enhanced partner status and apartment advanced cloud nature, and data expertise will enable us to help our clients modernize transform and simplify complex enterprise platform application and processes to accelerate business growth powered by Azure OpenAI service.\nCurrent results of these efforts are showing up an increasing number of conversations with clients and growing numbers of opportunities. And while it's still too early to say when we can show significant result in revenue growth, our production load is starting to come back to the level of comparable result of Q1. And we hope to see this trend takes shape during the next quarters.\nStill, despite signs of improving demand conditions, the global macroeconomic environment remains volatile and we see certain trends reflecting in our own bulls, notably in Europe, where the contraction in the third quarter is likely to take a few quarters to previous.\nNow we are [ down ] to global capabilities. India and LATAM for us are key growth delivery regions while Central, Eastern Europe and Central Western Asia are areas of stabilization after our massive allocation efforts. And we've seen future growth opportunities. Part of the effort regarding globalization and stabilization of delivery is the rightsizing and cost optimization across multiple locations. Based on current and future demand outlook and specific location capabilities, seniority of pyramids and office infrastructures. Some identical efforts are also relevant and several locations in Western Europe and North America.\nWhile optimizing some locations, we continue to reinvest in new talent in key initiatives to expand our engineering G&A across all strategic global delivery locations with continuous harmonization and upskilling efforts enabled by our own use of AI and can productivity platforms. Those efforts now on the way as we speak. And we're already seeing first results and expect to have additional benefits to materialize in 2024. This brings us to the topic of additional investments, which we mentioned in the past multiple times. We are continuously investing in our strategic priorities such as expansion of differentiated consulting agency data and cloud capabilities, with focus on vertical expertise.\nDevelopment of go-to-market cost-effective solutions which now include propositions related to use [indiscernible] AI across a broad range of business and technology use cases. Our strong cloud engineering data and [ our ] core services profile should position EPAM to benefit in the medium and long term from the impact of both current pent-up demand for modernization and also from the fundamental skills shortage in concrete technological transformations, still persist today. The impact will become even more real in terms of complexity of future applications and platforms by encapsulating not just currently available elements of G&A and requirements for trust, reliability and security management of AI, but also by closely integrated with new classes of composite and adaptive AI platforms as well as with foundational models and specific industry cloud platforms.\nOne of the key propositions offered by EPAM is our ability to make real -- as part of this focus, a number of our labs and centers of excellence have created IP that we are using to productize our learnings and to share them with our clients through our own open-source initiatives.\nWe mentioned our work with [ Dial ], our AI orchestration work bank in our previous call. And today, we see a number of extensions of this platform into specific use cases and specific industries based on real-life problems, which we have [indiscernible] with a growing variety of integrated are tools and data sources. One of our more significant investments related to us is a development and internal rollout of EPAM responsible AI framewoek and a broad in play training to adapt it.\nToday, we are confident that EPAM has a necessary capabilities and talent to help our clients to evolve in the general adoption of AI and also in modernization of applications and proper data engineering efforts drive the value promise to bring. Conversations with our clients on as it become generally understood that fundamental capabilities and readiness in cloud and vision in data, unnecessary previous for success. [ Till ] the level of interest continues to indicate the demand for our related services will build momentum into 2024 and beyond.\nI believe that provides a good level of overview of current state and our key areas of focus. To summarize, I would like to say that with the exciting opportunities in front of us. we are still facing a complete demand environment. We are working to invest for the future while balancing supply and demand for skills and capabilities across a much more diverse delivery footprint. This challenge continues as the wound Ukraine extends into the third year as well as the new disruptions in Middle East escalations require us to continuously adapt the company in appropriate manner. I would think at this point, we feel being well trained to manage all of the web.\nSo with that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q3 and for an update for our business outlook for the remainder of 2023.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, EPAM generated revenue of over $1.15 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6.1% on a reported basis or 8% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 190 basis points. Revenue in the quarter continued to be impacted by reduced program spending across a number of our clients as well as ongoing client cost and related to new project starts. The reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our exit from the market, had an approximate 50 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues year-over-year revenue for reported a constant currency would have decreased by 5.6% and 7.6%, respectively.\nBeginning with our industry verticals on a year-over-year basis, financial services decreased 3.3% driven by declines predominantly in banking, partially offset by growth in Asset management. [indiscernible] consumer decreased by 6.2% and primarily due to declines in consumer goods, partially offset by solid growth in travel and hospitality. Life sciences & health care declined 4.2%. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program in late 2022, which we have mentioned during our previous earnings call. On a sequential basis, growth in life sciences & health care was a positive 8.6%, and we expect to return to positive year-over-year growth next quarter. Business information & media declined 12% in the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by a reduction in spend across a number of large clients based on uncertainty in their end markets, particularly in the mortgage data space. Software and hi-tech contracted 15.1% The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by the reduction in revenue from a former top 20 customer we mentioned during our previous earnings calls and generally slower growth in revenue across a range of customers in the vertical.\nAnd finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid growth of 8.5%, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q3 revenues, declined 9.3% year-over-year or 9.5% in constant currency. On a sequential basis, growth in the Americas was relatively flat, an improvement from the declines in previous quarters in 2023. EMEA, representing 39% of our Q3 revenues grew 1.8% year-over-year and decreased 3.5% in constant currency.\nCEE representing less than 1% of our Q3 revenues, contracted 66.4% year-over-year or 58.8% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by EPAM's exit of its Russian operations. And finally, APAC declined 20.2% year-over-year or 19.8% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp down of work within our financial services vertical. In Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients declined 8.3% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 4.9%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 32.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 34.4% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q3 2023 reflects the negative impact of pricing pressure and lower utilization, partially offset by a lower level of variable compensation expense. GAAP SG&A was 16.9% of revenue compared to 16.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q3 2023 came in at 14.4% of revenue compared to 14.1% in the same period last year.\nGAAP income from operations was $114 million or 9.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $180 million or 14.7% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Included in our GAAP results in the quarter is a $25.9 million loss on the sale of the company's remaining holdings in Russia and $8.4 million in severance as we take steps to reduce our cost structure to better align with demand. Non-GAAP income from operations was $196 million or 17% of revenue in the quarter compared to $232 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year.\nOur GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in at 26.3%, which includes a onetime tax charge connected to the disposal of holdings in Russia and lower-than-expected excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.2%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.65. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.73, reflecting a $0.37 decrease compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q3, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $215 million compared to $252 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $211 million. compared to free cash flow of $234 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q3, DSO was 73 days and compares to 71 days for Q2 2023 and 69 days for the same quarter last year. The uptick in DSO reflects an increase in the time some clients are taking in the review and approval of payments, combined with the last day of the quarter falling on a weekend. Share repurchases in the third quarter were approximately 318,000 shares for $78.5 million at an average price of $246.44 per share. As of September 30, we had approximately $372 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Moving on to a few operational metrics.\nWe ended Q3 with more than 48,500 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Including the impact of our exit from Russia, production headcount has declined 10% compared to Q3 2022. This is the result of lower levels of hiring combined with both voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 54,600 employees. Utilization was 72.7% compared to 73.5% in Q3 of last year and 75.1% in Q2 2023.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. We are encouraged by the results of our demand generation efforts and new customer revenues resulting from these efforts. However, the level of new customer revenues being generated is still not enough to offset the impact from existing project ramp downs and reduced spending from our top 20 clients. We are beginning to see a degree of demand stability emerging in our North American portfolio, but we are also expecting an impact from planned ramp-downs at several of our European customers. Although there are encouraging signs, demand remains somewhat uncertain.\nIn addition to the negative impact, the Q4 seasonality usually has on revenue, we've also had a large number of employees relocate to countries that celebrate December holidays. In Q4, we were also expecting unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds in comparison with Q3. These factors are producing a sequential decline in Q4 revenue despite the stabilizing the demand environment. Our Ukrainian delivery organization continues to operate efficiently and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to deliver from Ukraine at productivity levels consistent with previous levels throughout 2023.\nDuring the third quarter, we elevated our focus on aligning our cost structure with the near-term demand environment, initiating a cost optimization program designed to reduce operating costs by 2.5% to 3%. This effort is clearly more intentional than our previous supply and demand balancing efforts. We think it is necessary to take this action in part to allow for further investment across our strategic initiatives, demand generation efforts and people programs.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we had $8.4 million in severance-related costs in Q3, of which $7.1 million related to the cost optimization program. In Q4, we expect to recognize a further $15 million in expenses as a result of this cost optimization program. We expect headcount will continue to decline in Q4 due to limited hiring and managed attrition, which will drive utilization slightly higher in the quarter.\nMoving to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.663 billion to $4.673 billion reflecting a year-over-year decline of approximately 3%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue to also decline by 3%. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation is expected to continue to be 23%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.07 to $7.15 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.31 to $10.39 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count at 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q4 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 8%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue to also decline by approximately 8%. For the [ first ] quarter, we expect GAAP income operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.75 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our Adaptive non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $36.3 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be minimal. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $12 million. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $1.3 million, and we expect to recognize approximately $15 million in expenses related to our cost optimization program. In addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarters in 2023, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in Q4 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q3 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.\nFinally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be $14 million in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2023, we intend to provide our 2024 business outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call scheduled for February. However, I would like to provide some commentary at this time to help frame our initial thoughts.\nAs Ark mentioned, the demand environment remains uneven, and we believe this will persist at least into the first half of 2024. We have been pleased with the progress we're making on demand generation, and we'll continue to prioritize revenue growth into 2024, which, in some pursuits include some degree of discounting. Additionally, in 2024, we expect to incur incremental costs due to more normalized variable compensation as well as salary increases from our annual compensation cycle, which typically occurs in Q2. Although the cost optimization program will better align our 2024 cost structure, we still expect wage pressure combined with the limited ability to improve client pricing to continue to put pressure on margins. While 2023 has been a challenging year for the IT sector in EPAM, we remain confident in our ability to drive historical levels of revenue growth and profitability in a more normalized demand environment.\nOperator, let's open the call up for questions."

Welcome to the EPAM Systems Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] please be advised, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2023 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind those listening to some of our comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into results of our second quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the mid-quarter update we provided in June. As I shared in my prepared remarks, the broader concerns over the economy led to a shift in demand dynamics for our sector. [indiscernible] has been much more pronounced due to the geopolitical impact on our delivery centers and our focus on the build and digital product engineering segments of the market, which represents about 80%, 85% of our engagement portfolio. This was especially evident in the technology vertical, which continues to be impacted by the pullback and spend after years of strong investments in digital and product development efforts while being spread broader across other industry segments as well.\nOver the last quarters, we have also seen this impact in some of our largest clients, as they have held back for direct spending from new build programs to the economic conditions and caution in their businesses. This factor has contributed to a high percentage of our shortfall over the first half of 2023.\nNow I'll switch to Q3 and the rest of 2023. While we are starting to see a few encouraging signs, we'll share more on that in a minute, today I would state that we expect still based on the current level of unpredictability, a negative dynamic to continue into the second half of 2023 but at a lower level than we saw in the first half of this year. With that, I would like to state that while we do understand that this is a difficult period for us and for the sector more broadly, based on insight from the past several years and past several quarters especially, we are turning that experience into pragmatic action plan, which we will be applying to our business throughout the remainder of this year and further into the future and consider this time an opportunity, which, as we all know, when new crisis presents, to transforming ourselves,\nSome of our current plans and actions are focused on making real-time adjustments to our go-to-market planning, customer engagement programs and global delivery platform stabilization. These key investments help us to prep ourselves for a strong rebound position. What is important also to note is that our primary focus on digital products and data engineering services combined with digital consulting agency design, content and digital marketing services will remain. In other words, the primary services and market segments, which allow us to double the company in the previous 3 years, are staying intact while we continue to tune our capabilities in line with the volume market demands.\nOur point is simple. The entire IT sector is undergoing what we believe is an evolution of the services market moving from the core IT to digitalization, even more broadly and with significant acceleration and to consider new digitally nascent businesses faster to reinvent entire models and ways of working and now is the promise of generative capabilities empowerment at the core. We have been at the forefront of similar trends before and, once again, are looking to put EPAM at center of new [indiscernible] services. We fully expect as a result to be underpinned and even more driven, by our traditionally strong product platform engineering, data analytics and machine learning capabilities, but now in combination with what generative AI promises.\nSo our thesis has been and continues to be that our core services profile will benefit in the medium and longer term from a concentration on cloud data and engineering. And we will capitalize strongly on our core capabilities once the general situation in our segment rebounds. The AI impact will become even more real in terms of complexity to future applications and platforms by encapsulating not just currently available elements of GenAI and a very visible needs for trust, reliability and security management of AI, but also by closely integrating with new classes of composite and adaptive AI platforms as well as with foundational models and specific industry cloud platforms. In short, we are optimistic about the transformative opportunities to the whole application stack coming from AI-led transformation, which is also well illustrated by our latest announcements.\nThat is one of the key areas of our investments. The second critical part is a further diversification and stabilization of our global delivery platform, including the allocation of our talent more optimally across the world.while, at the same time, enabling our strong engineering quality standards across all EPAM locations. This rebalancing effort will be performed over the next 3 to 4 quarters, in part, to drive higher levels of gross margin performance.\nOur other plans and actions today are focused on our immediate demand generation and new logo acquisitions. During the first half of 2023 and specifically in Q2, we drove new logo activity at higher levels than when compared to 2021 and 2022. We see this as a positive sign of our return to demand. We should accelerate the recovery and allow us to return to growth as soon as the current client base stabilizes. A few examples of our new Q2 clients include one of the world's leading B2B travel platforms, a large European-based multinational resilient marketplace organizing for trading of shares and other securities, a multibillion-dollar molecular diagnostic company specialized in detection of early stage cancers, a leading global insurance provider of financial protection, asset management and supplemental health benefit solutions and global infrastructure services company in the United States.\nIn these new programs, we are starting to include a more diverse stack of our capabilities from consulting to different types of implementation efforts. Some of those clients, we expect will support our next growth journey. In addition, we also see some programs with existing clients who have started ramping up. Recently, Canadian Tire announced their 7-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to accelerate the modernization and drive retail innovation across the Canadian markets. Leveraging our decade-long relationship with Canadian Tires, EPAM will be trusted improving engineering partner and digital system integrator to lead the effort.\nSo there are some signs indeed that the overall demand environment is coming to more normal terms for us. We probably will be able to share more next quarter of how strong those signs are going to be. But in any way, it also confirms that EPAM continues to remain very relevant and competitive even in current market of low demand for the build function, which is a good entry point to share some of our go-to-market progress, especially in relationship with hyperscalers.\nIn June, we announced a global strategic partnership with Google Cloud across our global markets, cloud solutions and focusing on specific efforts in our larger verticals, including financial services, consumer to economy and entertainment, health care, life sciences, energy and [ High Tech ] to help our customers to modernize and transform their businesses. We're also encouraged and energized by the momentum we are seeing with our other major cloud partners, Microsoft and AWS. More to come on this direction very soon. But just as a preview, you might have seen that we were recently made Microsoft's Great Partner of the Year for 2023 with couple other venerable recognitions with Microsoft Partner Network. In overall, we made very strong progress in establishing a real 360-degree relationship with all 3 major players and plan to be sharing more over the course of the next few weeks publicly.\nTwo final points. First, I just want to reiterate our view that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done in continued modernization, application development and integration and in considering and designing the models and strategies for business change. Our commitment to our expanding capabilities and engineering consulting can now work to create a next generation agency will help us to compete and win a new demand climate once customers gain confidence in the optimization initiatives and return the retention to growth.\nSecond, I wanted to touch on AI one more time, as it is obviously on everyone's mind these days. So how do we see its impact to our business and more critically to our customers and the industry at large? And of course, what are you doing to position EPAM for long-term success? EPAM has a long history of investing in [ RNG ] and our call to action over the years has been to make the promises of technology real. So rather than sharing any specific dollar amount we plan to spend on AI, which is very difficult to estimate with the current speed of change, we can instead share how we are thinking about directional investments today.\nCurrently, we pick investments with 2 principles in mind. Whatever you do have to be pragmatic to EPAM in terms of relevancy and deliver ability for our clients; and second, it has to be responsible and cost-effective. This translates to 2 broad categories of things we are working on, and you probably already saw some of this being announced. We are building accelerators in IT that help orchestrate full transformation program using the best available capabilities of large language models and related from works and tools. A significant portion of this is the work we are doing to change how we ourselves work from how we will do it to how we position and operate our company.\nWe are working across thousands of use cases to focus, first of all, on responsible, and very importantly, cost-effective solutions. Otherwise, future real progress will be difficult. To do so, we are focused on expanding our partnership, including with cloud providers and leading research centers to ensure those critical aspects and also focus ourselves on aligning internally across consulting and experience in technology to address that. The reality is that the production ready services application landscape is still very much at the entry stage of maturity today. While we see it is a very large and accelerating opportunity for us, specifically in our primary market segment, we are currently focusing on all type of activities to learn and experiment more from proof of concepts to real scale pilots and some scaled production initiatives.\nSo just like advances to our cloud over a decade ago,drove demand for advanced engineering, nerve generation architecture and hybrid and distributed delivery models, we are confident that this wave of AI-led requirements will drive more demand for advanced data engineering in cloud computing, content creation and the artificial intelligence native application as well as the new UX and UI paradigms. Our clients, who themselves make up a significant segment of technology companies in technology-led enterprises, in the mindset have already started arms race, which we should believe will be a real engine for the future growth. Some of that, we're already starting to see within our demand pipeline.\nWith that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q2 and for an update for our business outlook for the remainder of 2023.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q2 results, I wanted to remind you that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including EPAM's [ manager ] and commitment to Ukraine, business continuity resources and accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q2 earnings release.\nIn the second quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $1.17 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 2.1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 2.4% in constant currency terms, reflecting a favorable foreign exchange impact of 30 basis points. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by reductions in program spending across a number of our clients as well as ongoing client caution related to new project starts. The reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 100 basis point negative impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Excluding the Russia revenues, year-over-year revenue for reported and constant currency would have decreased by 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively.\nBeginning with our industry verticals. On a year-over-year basis, travel and consumer declined 1%, primarily due to declines in retail, partially offset by solid growth in travel and hospitality. Financial services grew 3.2%, with growth coming from asset management and insurance services. Business information and media decreased 4.1% in the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by a reduction in spend at a number of large clients based on uncertainty in their end markets, particularly in the mortgage data space. Software and Hi-Tech contracted 10.3%. The decline in the quarter reflected a reduction in revenue from the former top 20 customer we mentioned during our previous earnings call and generally slower growth in revenue across a range of customers in the vertical.\nLife Sciences and Health care declined 10.9%. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program mentioned during our previous earnings calls. On a sequential basis, growth in Life Sciences and Healthcare actually was a positive 2.9%, driven by new work at both existing and new logos. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered solid growth of 8.6%, driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region representing 58% of Q2 revenues, declined 5.9% year-over-year or 5.7% in constant currency. The growth rate in the quarter was impacted in part by the ramp down of life sciences and health care customer we mentioned during our previous earnings call. EMEA, representing 39% of our Q2 revenues, grew 8.5% year-over-year or 6.5% in constant currency. [ CEE ] represented 1% of our Q2 revenues contracted 61.1% year-over-year or 45.8% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit our Russia operations and the resulting ramp-down in services to Russia customers. And finally, APAC declined 19.7% year-over-year or 18.6% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp-down of work within our financial services vertical.\nIn Q2, revenues from our top 20 customers declined 2.4% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 declined 1.9%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 30.9% compared to 29.2% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% compared to 31.5% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q2 2023 reflects a lower level of variable compensation expense, partially offset by the negative impact of lower utilization. GAAP SG&A was 16.7% of revenue compared to 19.5% in Q2 of last year. SG&A in Q2 2022 included a more significant level of expenses resulting from Russia's invasion in Ukraine. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q2 2023 came in at 14.8% of revenue compared to 15.2% in the same period last year. Reductions in both cost of revenue and SG&A during the quarter reflect the company's ongoing focus on managing its cost base as well as reduced variable compensation expense due to the lower level of financial performance expected for the year.\nIn Q2, EPAM incurred $5 million in severance-related expense included in both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A as the company works to better align its cost structure with the current demand environment. GAAP income from operations was $144 million or 12.3% of revenue in the quarter compared to $93 million or 7.8% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $191 million or 16.3% of revenue in the quarter compared to $177 million or 14.9% of revenue in Q2 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20%. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.03. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.64, reflecting a $0.26 increase compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q2, there were approximately 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $89 million compared to $78 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $82 million compared to free cash flow of $59 million in the same quarter last year. At the end of Q2, DSO was 71 days and compares to 69 days for Q1 2023 and 71 days for the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will remain steady throughout 2023. Share repurchases in the second quarter were approximately 195,000 shares for $41.4 million at an average price of $212.77 per share. As of June 30, we had approximately $450 million of share repurchase authority remaining. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q2 with more than 49,350 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects. Production headcount declined 10% compared to Q2 2022, the result of lower levels of hiring, combined with voluntary and involuntary attrition as we continue to balance supply and demand. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 55,600 employees. Utilization was 75.1% compared to 78% in Q2 of last year and 74.9% in Q1 2023.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. As Ark mentioned, we have seen a higher level of new logo acquisitions and revenue from our focused efforts on demand generation. While this progress is encouraging, the level of revenue generated is not enough to offset further expected reductions in client budgets, ramp-downs and delays in new program starts. With the range of outcomes we outlined on our June 5 call, we are maintaining our expectations for a muted demand environment with sequential decline in Q3 and further sequential or flat revenue growth in Q4. Our Ukrainian delivery organization continues to operate efficiently, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from Ukraine in productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in 2022.\nConsistent with previous cycles, we will continue to thoughtfully calibrate our expense levels while investing in our capabilities and focusing on the preservation of our talent in preparation for a return to higher levels of demand. We expect headcount will continue to decline modestly in Q3 due to limited hiring and more typical attrition, and we will continue to limit hiring until we see improving demand. We expect utilization to decline slightly in the second half of the year, primarily driven by a higher level of expected vacations.\nLastly, at the end of July, we completed the sale of our Russian business, which will result in a decline in Russian revenues from Q2 to Q3. But we will also recognize an estimated loss on sale of $18.4 million which will impact our Q3 and full year GAAP results. Additionally, this will drive a further modest reduction in headcount.\nMoving on to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.65 billion to $4.70 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of approximately 3%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit in Russia, we expect revenue decline to also be approximately 3%, both at the midpoint of the range. We expect GAAP income from operations to now be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5%, which includes the loss associated with the sale of our Russian business. The non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15% to 16%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 22%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation is expected to continue to be 23%. For earnings per share, we expect that GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7 to $7.20 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $9.90 to $10.10 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to our Q3 2023 outlook. We expect revenues to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion, producing a year-over-year decline of 6% to 7%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit in Russia, we expect revenue to decline by 8.5% to 9.5%. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.1 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $39 million for each of the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.5 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be a $1.5 million gain for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $11.7 million for Q3 and $9.3 million for Q4. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $2.7 million for Q3 and $1.8 million for Q4.\nIn addition to these customer GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarters in 2023, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in 2023 resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q2 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance. Finally, one more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are now generating a healthy level of interest income and are now expecting interest and other income to be $11.7 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nLastly, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers. Operator, let's open the call up for questions."

Welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2023 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings.\nAdditionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measure and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President\n\nThank you, David. Thank you, for joining us today. 3 months ago, you shared some details of what we were thinking about and how we saw the main factors and trends driving our performance during the year.\nAs you will recall, we anticipated some level of market slowdown in general demand but we are not certain of the impact level of this slowdown in our own portfolio yet. We also saw that some of our customers were mitigating the risk exposure due to the war in Ukraine, and we are showing signs of managing those rigs by diversifying work streams to some other partners.\nWith understanding of all of that, we were proactively investing in building scalable quality delivery locations outside of our traditional comfort zone to consistently deliver in comparable engineering quality across all of our growing global delivery markets.\nAnd we also said that we were expecting to continuously optimize operations across our global delivery locations to bring the cost structure back to our traditional metrics in near and medium time frame.\nAnd despite a number of the specific challenges, we believe that the market for our services continues to be strong, and our proposition remains extremely relevant. So we were broadly expecting a general uplift in demand going into the second half of 2023.\nToday, 3 months later, we understand that the visibility we had in 3 quarters. We underestimated the breadth of the macroeconomic slowdown and the depth of the impact specifically in the transformational sector of the IT services market.\nAnd as you know, we always stated that our customers are almost exclusively global enterprises, leading global platform companies and venture-backed emerging tech firms to design, engineer and deploy exactly life scale transformational and digital engineering programs, helping them to grow and to differentiate themselves basement technology advanced solutions.\nOur work largely supports the disruptive business model accelerates growth and specifically target new product data and cloud platform development and modernization programs. Such work was an ease in our focus area and represents a very significant share of our revenue, especially in comparison with most of other companies within the global IT services segment.\nExactly that type of work was largely responsible for a significantly stronger growth rates during the last few decades. Unfortunately, it is that resource programs are all currently showing visible signs of weakness. Instead, during the last 3 months, it became very clear that the economic environment is more focused than it has been for the case. On cost optimization, which for now benefit in more traditional outsourcing firms with strong cost take out offerings.\nWe understand this is likely a continuous story as the market adjusts the new economic conditions and the investment climate changes. It means that with all global unusual impact on demand and the headwinds associated with the world. We must accept the picture for EPAM is more complex and nuanced and yes, visibly changed today from what we shared with you just 3 months ago.\nBut before we go into what we're doing to address the immediate challenges and to share some of our more tactical priorities and efforts I want to restate our view on our mid- and long-term positioning in the future beyond 2023 growth perspective.\nLet me start with something we all know well. Technology change and the disruption of traditional business models was the main growth driver during the last decade. During those decades, we saw only 3 relatively short recessional period for the technology sector. There is simple evidence that those companies who invested in their digital transformation during the slow period, and those who adapted to new tech and applied new business models realized by the faster versus those who just focused on straight cost-cutting becomes the new leaders in their markets.\nFor us, each of those short downturns led to increased surges in demand for our unique retail services and consequently to our historical growth rate of 20-plus percent and on very consistent and long-term basis.\nWe believe that nothing changed from that trend, and we are in the middle of another turn when we're about to adopt a new wave of technology impact. This is why we believe that the current situation is temporary and that in line with the past, we will see a similar come back pattern, pushing companies we strive to lead for accelerated investments in new and disruptive contact solution based on rapid adoption of new advanced technologies.\nWith that, we also believe that we will continue to benefit from our traditional capabilities and our delivery track record and that give us the confidence that we're fundamentally better positioned for future accelerated growth than most of other market players.\nThose critical come pillars includes: first, our continuous focus on differentiated product and platform development versus more traditional outsourcing BPO and packaging limitation deals. And our engineering DNA built over the credits.\nThose make us the best partner to alone understand and implement new solutions which lie in the next generation technologies. And yes, we do want to share with you in anticipation of the like equation that is a public adoption of generative AI and widespread use of language models or LLM.\nWe already have dozen active use cases across the global network of practitioners in all our verticals and horizontal functional areas that we are actively proceeding with both internally and with our customers.\nSecond, our investments and broad deployment of the plan continuum integrated consulting services, push strategy and experience even closer with and together, accelerating the value we can bring from investments in data and machine learning and generative AI technologies by advising on what is possible tomorrow and what can be made real today.\nAnd third, all of our customer engagements and our people are enabled by our own digital platforms which preparing much stronger pipeline and current capabilities of ML and AI and LLM to drive increased work productivity and knowledge sharing at a new global scale for us.\nTo sum up, in our view, even with complicated macroeconomic headwinds, the market still points towards disruption and demand companies to transform again to address the challenges posed by many emerging technologies, including such as generative AI, which everyone is talking about it today.\nBut what is difficult to predict right now is when they come back, we'll start at full speed. We believe that it will be happening rather sooner than later in quarters, not in years. Still right now, we obviously have an immediate and different challenge.\nSo let us talk about our last quarter and now thinking about the rest of 2023. With all the complexities of current environment, our performance in the first quarter was sorted. While that gives us a better start to move further into complex 2023 environment, we have to acknowledge the combination of conditions we talked already today with general pullback and delays on transformation spend and the new risk concerns taken by our customers has now translated into a revision to our initial revenue expectations for the year.\nWith this new view, we are addressing visibly our full year revenues and EPS outlook. And during the year, we expect to be thinking more about sequential growth metric versus our traditional year-over-year trends.\nJason will talk about all the relevant details in his section. For now, as long as we are seeing contracted budgets for new build business, we will be adopting a 3-pronged approach to navigate the current environment.\nFirst, putting all possible efforts to address our current customers' most pressing tactical items, including the mix of engagement models, cost takeouts and consolidation priorities, while protecting our shareholder wallet and long-term relationships, all possibly leading to lower short-term profitability metrics.\nSecond, and quickly growing new business through increased focus on sales and GTM motions and partnerships, especially across those champions who would like to use this slow time to build a competitive advantage.\nOver the last quarter our global business field organization and specialized practice teams have focused on developing new engagement models and new ways of working with our customers and have done so with some success a new momentum in the logo acquisition.\nWe will still take some time to realize a large revenue impact down the line, especially in the current economic climate; and third, to continuously investing in our strategic priorities, which are staying in line with what we communicated before. expansion of differentiated consulting agencies, data ML, AI and cloud capabilities building, improving our retiring by delivering strategy and implementation simultaneously, expanding our engineering DNA across all strategic global delivery location.\nFlow in at situation on the sharp return on demand for the net generation transformation services.\nWith that, as part of our continuous investment strategy, I'm going to share some updates on our global delivery expansion programs. During the past quarter, we have made good progress in both maintaining the level of delivery quality in recent Central Europe and strengthening such quality in Central and Western Asia where both years benefited from integrating strong talent moving to many new locations across the regions.\nAs part of our heritage and our core differentiation, Eastern and Central Europe delivery and most notably, our Ukrainian operation will continue to be and constant about proposition, while we accelerate our investments in new center of excellence and while we continue to hire across our global footprint for high demand skills.\nAs part of the global delivery strategy, we continue to focus on building out further our 2 currently fastest-growing regions, India and Latin America. In addition to opening several new locations across those geographies, we are happy to see sizable work streams starting and expanding there.\nAnd now not only from our existing clients, but also with brand new logos who are attracted by advantages demonstrated by EPAM in those regions. It's also important to mention the configuration of our client footprint in those still relatively new for us geographies now very much represents our traditional client mix with some of our top 10 customers, but also new ones across multiple verticals from large corporations to technology platform, forms and to software product companies.\nIn our view, it's a very good illustration of the quality of the services we are delivering from the region, confirming the continued investments into engineering programs, education and integrated delivery platforms bring the results we expected to achieve to date.\nAlso this experience over the past few years, we are now able to stand up new locations across upon global footprint in months versus years by leveraging all elements of our digital platform ecosystem and strong talent acquisition capabilities.\nWe believe during the next few years, we will be able to build the most de-balance delivery talent platform on the market.\nTo conclude, we believe that while we are experiencing and addressing accordingly very specific but still temporary challenges, fundamentally, we are moving in the right direction. Our strategy for future accelerated growth is based on delivering concrete business solution driven by advanced disruptive technology and quality engineering.\nMany of those solutions require unique alignment with consulting and implementation services and are specifically attracted to the client base consisting of leading global enterprises whose markets are driven and disrupted by continuous technological transformation.\nWe do believe that such enterprises will have to come back to significant investments into technology build component to lead and disrupt further the respectful markets, and they will need partners like EPAM to progress.\nWith that, I would like to pass to Jason to share more details and numbers for Q1 and for a change in outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q1 results, I wanted to remind you that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures related to PMC Manager and commitment to Ukraine and costs associated with the exit of our Russian operations business continuity resources and accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results.\nWe have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q1 earnings release. In the first quarter, EPAM delivered solid results. The company generated revenue of $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 3.4% on a reported basis and 4.9% in constant currency terms reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 150 basis points.\nAdditionally, the reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 220 basis point negative impact on revenue growth. Excluding Russia revenues year-over-year revenue growth would have been 5.6% reported and over 7% on a constant currency basis.\nBeginning with our industry verticals. Travel and Consumer grew 4.9%, driven by solid growth in travel and hospitality and muted growth in retail. The ongoing exit of Russia operations also impacted growth in this vertical. Absent the impact growth would have been 6.7%. Financial Services grew 4.1%, with strong growth coming from asset management and insurance services.\nExcluding Russia customer revenues, growth would have been 12.5%. Business Information and Media delivered 4.2% growth in the quarter. Software and high-tech produced nil growth. The lack of growth in the quarter reflected a reduction in revenue from a former top 20 customer we mentioned on our Q4 earnings call and generally slower growth in revenues across the range of customers in the vertical.\nLife Sciences and Healthcare declined 10.1%. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of a large transformational program mentioned during our Q4 earnings call. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered strong growth of 14.7%, driven by clients in manufacturing, automotive and energy.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q1 revenues grew 3.4% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. EMEA representing 38% of our Q1 revenues grew 10% year-over-year or 13.3% in constant currency. CEE representing 1% of our Q1 revenues contracted 68.8% year-over-year or 70.8% in constant currency.\nRevenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit our Russian operations and the resulting ramp down of services to Russia customers. And finally, APAC declined 9.4% year-over-year or 6.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues. Revenue in the quarter was impacted primarily by the ramp down of work at a financial services client.\nIn Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 5.3% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 2.3%. And moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.3% compared to 33.4% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.5% compared to 33.3% for the same quarter last year.\nGross margin in Q1 2023 reflects the negative impact of lower utilization and some year-over-year compression in account margins. GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenues compared to 20.3% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.3% of revenues compared to 15.6% in the same period last year.\nBoth GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense in Q1 2023 and include $9.5 million in severance-related expense incurred as the company works to better align its cost structure with the current demand environment. GAAP income operations was $120 million, or 9.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $129 million or 11% of revenue in Q1 of last year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations was $178 million or 14.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $189 million or 16.1% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 19.6% versus our Q1 guide of 18%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefit was 22.9%. The Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.73. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.47, reflecting a $0.02 decrease compared to the same quarter in 2022. In Q1, there were approximately 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to cash flow and our balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was a positive $87 million compared to a negative $52 million in the same quarter of 2022. Q1 2022 cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in DSO and the payment of a higher level of company-wide variable compensation based on our 2021 performance.\nFree cash flow was $79 million compared to a negative free cash flow of $75 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q1, DSO was 69 days and compares to 70 days for Q4 2022 and 69 days for the same quarter last year.\nLooking ahead, we expect DSO will remain steady throughout 2023. Now moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended Q1 with more than 51,100 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects.\nProduction headcount declined 7.1% compared to Q1 2022. The net decrease in head count is a result of the reduction in Russia based head count, a lower level of hiring across the organization and a largely completed program designed to produce modest levels of encouraged attrition. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 57,450 employees. Utilization was 74.9% compared to 78.4% in Q1 of last year and 73.6% in Q4 2022.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. We are beginning to see the results of our focus on generating demand from new programs and customers. However, we are also seeing a continuation in the uneven demand environment to begin in Q4 2022. We and the global economic environment has not yet stabilized sufficiently to support client confidence. The demand environment continues to be characterized by slower decision-making caution around spending and program ramp downs due to uncertainty in serving client end markets.\nAs a result, our overall level of demand is not improving sufficiently to support our initial revenue outlook. As highlighted during our Q4 earnings call, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted, and our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterested production.\nOur guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers to productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in 2022. Consistent with previous cycles, we will continue to thoughtfully calibrate our expense levels while investing in our capabilities and focusing on the preservation of our talent in preparation for a return of demand.\nWe expect headcount will continue to decline somewhat in Q2 due to limited hiring and more typical attrition and we will limit hiring in the second half until we see improving demand. We expect utilization in the mid-70s throughout the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, the exit of our Russian operations and the reduction in Russia customer revenues produces a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison primarily in the first half of 2023. Moving to our full year outlook. We now expect revenue will be in the range of $4.95 billion to $5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 3%.\nOn an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue growth to be just over 3%, both at the midpoint of the range. We are currently expecting sequential growth in both Q3 and Q4. However, we no longer expect to be able to generate double-digit year-over-year growth in either quarter.\nWe expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 21%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will also continue to be 23%.\nEarnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.11 to $8.31 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 for the full year. We now expect weighted average share count of 59.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nNow moving to our Q2 2023 outlook. We expect revenues to be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.205 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of less than 1%. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding the impact of the exit from Russia, we expect revenue growth to also be less than 1%, both at the midpoint of the range.\nFor the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 11% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14% to 15%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.90 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 and to $2.46 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.4 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the second quarter and remainder of the year. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $33 million for Q2 and $38 million for each of the remaining quarters.\nAmortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible for the remainder of the year.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $9.5 million for Q2 and $9 million for each of the remaining quarters. We expect excess tax benefits to be around $6 million for Q2, $4 million for Q3 and $2 million for Q4.\nIn addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarter in 2022 we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in 2023, resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q1 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.\nFinally, 1 more assumption outside of our GAAP to non-GAAP items. With our significant cash position, we are generating a healthy level of interest income. We had expected an elevated level of interest income relative to past years when we developed our original full year guidance.\nHowever, due to the larger positive impact on EPS in 2023, we are updating our assumptions regarding interest income and making them explicit.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect interest income to be $8 million for Q2 and $7 million for each of the remaining quarters. Lastly, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers.\nOperator, let's open the call for questions."

Welcome to the EPAM Systems Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of IR, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received your copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let me begin today with a simple statement that we are very proud of everyone in EPAM achieved over our nearly [3 decades] and that we are very thankful to the people of EPAMers for their tremendous contribution over those years.\nAnd I would like also to add one more thought, which feels very important to bring to the top of our conversation. While we all know that war in Ukraine is still dominating global headlines and we are seeing this ripple effect across many sectors and geographies. For us at EPAM and many people around us, this war continues to be a very central part of our lives, deeply personal and a constant priority.\nWith that, I would like to start with an update on our progress across our 4-phased approach, which we shared with you 6 months ago back in May as well as an update on some adjustments we are making as a result of newly available information.\nOur first phase, the safety of our employees and stabilization of our operations in Ukraine. The work has been ongoing for 8 months already. Last time we met, we indicated that we thought that it was going to be longer than anybody was thinking when it began. And we all understand the situation continues to be very serious, and also the safety is a very relative term for people within Ukraine border today. With all of that, we are constantly and proactively helping our employees, their families and the people of Ukraine as much as we can by providing the right range of support, including regional allocations and all forms of local assistance, making it possible for our people, their families and often industry colleagues to continue to live and work in Ukraine.\nWe are also continually developing ways to address new and unpredictable [just-yesterday] challenges and we are trying to also think proactively about what we can do today to make it easier and safer for tomorrow. And with all of that, we are working together across our own locations to maintain the highest level of service possible for our customers across all of our delivery locations within Ukraine. Even with the recent level of (inaudible) stability, the productivity of our teams in country remains high, which make us believe that we can count on this level of resilience in our delivery operations when we are sharing our guidance with the market today.\nThank you to our Ukrainian team and all EPAMers for making this possible. It's simply just incredible. Thank you.\nMoving to our second phase, the acceleration of our global diversification efforts and continued growth of our diverse capabilities. Over the last 8 months, we have accelerated key parts of our global strategy, in many ways a completion what we had planned to do over several years. Our delivery location geographies become more and more balanced. Last quarter, we reported that impacted regions accounted for 40% of our [talent], while today, this practically related from Russia. Approximately 30% of our talent remains in the immediate regions.\nSomething we plan to achieve closer to the end of this year. So our presence in Europe outside of those regions, in Central and Western Asia, India and Latin America are growing proportional. In short, the adaptation of our business as a position of our delivery organization is moving forward at unprecedented pace. We are very thankful to the many thousands of EPAMers and their immediate families for their loyalty, trust and their decision to move to new country locations while staying resilient and continue to work at EPAM.\nWhile it has been accomplished undertaken, we are encouraging by our overall levels of engagement and productivity we have seen in our many new caps and satellite locations. Many of those employees bring in years of experience, skills and knowledge with them and are key to our global expansion efforts. And we further see, integrate and scale a globally resident workforce, now operating in more than 50 countries. Please note that during the time, we practically doubled the number of locations, which should enable us to establish additional (inaudible) for us means over 5,000 people, talent hubs during the next few years. and some of these [hubs] didn't elan exist at EPAM in February of 2022.\nAs you can see, we are passionate about creating technology hubs and expanding our investment in many of the geographies. As a result, our global delivery platform and new ways of working should position us to become one of the most geographically balanced and value-added services company in the market.\nMoving to Phase 3 of continuing to serve and expand demand for our services for our growing global customer portfolio and place for our focus on profitability. Those 2 are very connected. We are working closely with our customers to reposition sizable portions of our program portfolio with our disruption and in part on quality. And while our business continue to progress have been necessary to plan for contingencies and enable uninterrupted services quality. Our customer portfolio is now better diversified and more resilient, giving them a new level of engagement and new talent options that should establish a broader, more valuable partnership framework for us [post war].\nToday, we are staying close to our customers and working through different project plans and contingencies and what has begun for us a new normal. That also includes our efforts around coming back to the profit levels that are in line with our historic numbers. As you can see, we have some intermediate success in that direction already. While it is still too early to say that we have overcome the challenge to make it sustainable.\nOn that type of navigation and unpredictable, I would like also to share here that during the recent (inaudible) in October, EPAM was a future case study on labor and global talent resiliency exactly based on our efforts over the last 8 months to adapt, to provide safety to our people and assistance with relocations and for continually investing in our capabilities and future growth while navigating the unpredictable. We believe that most of the efforts highlighted by (inaudible) have put us onto a new trajectory or establishing foundation, if you will, that will position EPAM for continued future growth and market differentiation.\nHere, I would like to mention 3 more on top of what we have already shared. Progressing EPAM continuing our integrated consulting portion, which opens new market entry points and extend the depth and breadth of our existing relationship with customers to cover even more strategic set of buyers in our portfolio, also reflected by our increased onsite production with [con] ratio, which is now 13.6%, the highest in our history.\nFurthering our ecosystem partnerships enabled by our product and platform engine heritage and new scale and market to bring them in relevant solutions to customers facing increasingly corporate business and technology environments.\nLastly, significantly investing on our educational platforms, which keeps our employees on the cutting edge and allow us to attract and work to develop and deploy global talent for EPAM as well as offer (inaudible) educational services to our platforms. In a more simple way, with all above efforts, we are very focused on maintaining our engineering and technology advantage and reputation across all our new and already established locations.\nYes, we do understand that it is exactly one of the key questions you, as investors, and all our clients are asking today and also probably about our ability to continue moving higher in the value chain, something we started 10 years ago and what we are very eager to continue doing now and in the future, proving to the market that we would be able to navigate the next transformation of EPAM to be able to offer to our clients [something], which is rare in the market: strategy and competition simultaneously and at scale and doing that better than most of our competitors can.\nWith that, let's talk a bit about our Q3 results. While Jason will share as always the full level of detailed write-up. In the third quarter, EPAM delivered $1,230 million in revenues, a 24% year-over-year growth and non-GAAP per share of $3.10, a 30% increase over Q3 2021. I think it's important to mention that in constant currency terms and with proper adjustment on discontinued revenue in Russia, that growth would be about 35%. Also during this quarter, the company generated $234 million of free cash flow and now has approximately $1.5 billion of cash on hand.\nWe are proud and grateful to all our teams for continuously managing the business at this level while responding to constant pressure to plan and execute a large number of tactical adjustments in an increasingly complete geopolitical and economic environment and especially thankful to our teams in Ukraine.\nAs you have likely heard during the last month, some of our partners and customers have been messaging the expectation for a global slowdown in demand, and they result in actions to better align their businesses to this new environment. So for us, while the demand environment continues to be active across a number of our end markets, including client second transformational programs, products, platform development and modernization efforts in addition to the opportunities triggered from the recent acquisitions, we can confirm that there has been an increasing focus for programs that are tied to driving the short-term cost savings, other OpEx efficiencies and growth range of optimization programs.\nFor [each] EPAM is also properly positioned today. Still, even with all confidence that our services remain highly relevant and in demand we are beginning to see signs of growth level for the -- so while we are taking steps to moderate our high-income spending and response, we are also reminded of previous downturns, out of which we grew at unprecedented rate.\nAs such, we are working to carefully collaborate our supply and demand outlook to capture the demand up since when [it returns] as we did it in the past.\nAs we wrap up 2022, we believe that we will have contained the initial impact of the work within the fiscal year, including the discontinuation of our operations in Russia. But overall, we know that we are still in the middle of ongoing crisis in Ukraine. And unfortunately, it doesn't seem that right now it will be possible to contain the full part of the world just within 2022 as we have previously called.\nWhat has changed over the past 2 quarters is that when we say we can and will adjust our operations, we are confident that under circumstances we can do so reliably and quickly. And exactly that for us is a very important confirmation, that after almost 30 years of our existence after 10 years of being a publicly traded company and after becoming a S&P 500 member, we still can demonstrate our strong entrepreneurial DNA and we still can benefit from it by acting as a startup as it ensures our ability to adapt and to grow further while for the current time, we are still playing for different types of mitigation scenarios in response to ongoing war events to protect EPAM and our employees who remain in the region.\nNevertheless, we are confident that the steps we have taken to reposition and diversify the company have created an even stronger foundation for future growth as we focus on EPAM as a $10 billion company, very much in line with what we shared with you in early 2022 before the word we go.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q3 results and additional perspective as we look at Q4 and beyond.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. Before covering our Q3 results, I wanted to remind everyone that in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures related to EPAM's management and commitment to Ukraine, the exit of our Russian operations and costs associated with accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We've included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q3 earnings release.\nIn the third quarter, EPAM delivered another set of strong results across both top and bottom line in addition to strong cash flow generation. During Q3, EPAM generated revenues of $1.23 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24.1% on a reported basis and 29.8% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 570 basis points. Additionally, the reduction in Russian customer revenues resulting from our decision to exit the market had a 470 basis point negative impact on revenue growth. Adjusting for the exit of our Russian operations, reported revenue growth would have been approximately 29%.\nLooking at the performance of our industry verticals in geographic regions in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the ongoing exit of our Russia operations and the effect of foreign exchange on our U.S. dollar reported results were helpful. I'll provide an adjusted year-over-year comparison.\nBeginning with our industry verticals, travel & consumer grew 41.9%, driven by strong organic growth, primarily from our retail customers as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions.\nLife sciences & healthcare grew 35% with strong growth coming from the health care industry in addition to growth in life sciences.\nFinancial services grew 10.4%, with growth coming from asset management, banking, and to a lesser extent, in insurance. Excluding our Russia customers, growth would have been 25.4% and 29.9% in constant currency.\nBusiness information & media delivered 20.8% growth in the quarter, driven primarily by customers in the business information industry.\nSoftware & Hi-Tech grew 17.8% in the quarter.\nAnd finally, our emerging verticals delivered 26.6% growth driven by clients in energy, manufacturing and automotive. Excluding our Russia customers, growth was 29.5% or 39.4% in constant currency.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 61% of our Q3 revenues, grew 26.3% year-over-year or 27.7% in constant currency.\nEMEA representing 36% of our Q3 revenues, grew 35.3% year-over-year or [50.3%] in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by strong organic growth, combined with an incremental contribution from recent acquisitions.\nCEE representing 1% of our Q3 revenues contracted 77.2% year-over-year or 80.2% in constant currency. Revenue in the quarter was impacted by our decision to exit Russia and the resulting ramp-down of services to Russia customers.\nAnd finally, APAC grew 10.5% year-over-year or 15.4% in constant currency terms and now represents 2% of our revenues.\nIn Q3, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 22% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 25%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 32.6% compared to 33.9% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.4% compared to 35.1% for the same quarter last year. Compared to Q3 2021, gross margin in Q3 2022 reflects the negative impact of lower utilization as well as a benefit from foreign exchange and the positive impact of a more normalized expense related to variable compensation.\nIn Q3 2021, expense related to variable compensation was unusually high based on the strong bottom line and extremely strong top line performance during that year. Q3 2022 was also negatively impacted by the timing difference associated with EPAM's ongoing efforts to align bill rates based on employee relocations. However, we have made better progress adjusting rates than originally anticipated. As a result, the negative impact on profitability was more limited than originally expected.\nGAAP SG&A was 16.1% of revenue compared to 17.1% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 14.1% of revenue compared to 15.3% in the same period last year. SG&A performance in the quarter reflected a lower level of costs related to both variable compensation and facilities and also includes a positive benefit of foreign exchange.\nGAAP income from operations was $180 million or 14.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $144 million or 14.6% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $232 million or 18.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $180 million or 18.2% of revenue in Q3 of last year.\nQ3 non-GAAP income from operations reflects a lower level of variable compensation and a positive impact from foreign exchange, offset by a lower level of utilization.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4% primarily driven by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 23.1%.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.63, reflecting a $0.68 or 34.9% increase year-over-year. GAAP EPS includes the impact of Ukraine humanitarian expenditures, expenses related to accelerated staff relocations and costs related to the planned exit of our Russian operations. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.10 and reflecting a $0.68 increase or 28.1% growth over the same quarter in 2021.\nIn Q3, there were approximately 59.4 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $252 million compared to $206 million in the same quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $234 million compared to free cash flow of $185 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nAt the end of Q3, DSO was 69 days and compares to 71 days for Q2 2022 and 70 days for the same quarter last year.\nIn Q4, we traditionally experienced a further improvement in DSO and expect a similar result this year.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 53,900 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 14.5%. Our total head count for Q3 was more than 60,250 employees. Compared to Q2, we saw a net decrease of approximately 1,000 head count. The net decrease in head count is a result of the reduction in Russia-based head count, combined with a lower level of hiring across the organization due to better-than-expected productivity in Ukraine and with a focus on moving utilization towards higher levels.\nUtilization was 73.5% compared to 77.1% in Q3 of last year and 78% in Q2 2022. Utilization continues to be impacted by the war in Ukraine.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. As we've done in previous quarters, let me provide some context that is informing our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect a solid demand environment, including demand for programs, helping clients drive additional revenue, modernization and optimization. In a few cases, in the retail and consumer space, we are seeing signs of moderation in demand due to delays in decision-making or additional scrutiny on program budgets as certain customers become more cautious regarding shifting demand in their end markets.\nAs a reminder, the exit of our Russian operations and the reduction in Russia customer revenues produces a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison, particularly in Q4, which has generally been a seasonally strong quarter in Russia. To date, our operations in Ukraine have not been materially impacted by the recent escalation of the tax. And our teams remain highly focused on maintaining uninterrupted production.\nOur guidance assumes that we will continue to be able to deliver from our Ukraine delivery centers at productivity levels at or somewhat lower than those achieved in Q3 and consistent with our experience in the month of October.\nThrough September 30, EPAM spent more than $39 million as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to our Ukranian employees and their families. We expect further humanitarian expenditures will be made in Q4 and during 2023.\nNow moving to our Q4 2022 outlook. We expect revenues to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.230 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 11% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency terms, both at the midpoint of the range. Included in these growth rates is approximately 100 basis points of revenue contributed from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months.\nAdditionally, the ramp-down of Russian customer revenues due to our decision to exit this market has a negative impact, reducing our expected revenue growth rate by approximately 500 basis points.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%.\nWe expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 23%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.10 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.6 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $33 million.\nAmortization of intangible sales is expected to be approximately $5.7 million.\nThe impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $9.6 million.\nAnd finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $4.3 million in the quarter.\nIn addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and consistent with the prior quarters in 2022, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in Q4 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q3 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.\nOur fourth quarter outlook reflects a solid demand environment, combined with improving operating performance, allowing EPAM to return to its traditional 16% to 17% adjusted IFO range sooner than anticipated. Although we still face ongoing challenges, this is a significant achievement given the amount of disruption that the company is managing through as a result of the war in Ukraine. We will continue to closely manage the operations of EPAM while remaining attentive to any changes in the demand environment.\nLastly, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and focus on our customers. Operator, let's open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of IR, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's second quarter 2022 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings.\nAdditionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings materials located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to start by reminding you of our earnings call three months ago and then our Investors and Analyst Day on May 19, when we shared our approach and higher-level plan for the following months.\nAt that time, we said that we didn't expect the war to end quickly. And as a result, our plans for adapting the company were developing based on a series of overlapping efforts or phases. Today, we are still very much in the war time, and we don't fully see a definitive conclusion for it in the near term. That means that, as we expected, we are continually adjusting our operations, our delivery organization and ways of working to what is our new normal now.\nSo let's go quickly by the progress we are making across those phases. First phase is the focus of the safety of our employees and stabilization of our operations in Ukraine. At this time, all our employees are in safe locations, either within the country or in neighboring countries. And our teams continue to work supporting our customers at levels of productivity very much in line with what we experienced before the war or during war.\nIn addition, in this new normal, we continue to support our Ukrainian employees and their families as well as the Ukrainian people. We are providing various forms of humanitarian relief with EPAM Ukraine Assistance Fund and our $100 million assistance commitment, which we have now done in March. I would just add that we are constantly moved by the resilience and morale of our Ukrainian employees, and we want to take one more opportunity to thank them for their incredible commitment and level of purpose they demonstrate.\nThe second phase of our framework is acceleration of our global digitization efforts and continued growth of our diverse capabilities. And yes, this includes first of all geographical diversification of our delivery platform. But it also includes many other critical aspects of our operations and several key investments efforts, which ensures the quality of delivery while we are expanded rapidly across multiple tiers.\nWe are located in already digital delivery locations in India, Latin America and Central Asia, as well as establishing several newly-created delivery hubs and expected many existing sites across Central and Eastern Europe and Western and Central Asia as well. This is also supported by the active redeployment of many of our current employees. We decided to explore opportunities outside of their home countries and simultaneously establishing a strong EPAM cultural foundation in those locations to further develop the local talent market and fastly grow its EPAM hubs.\nLooking at our global footprint. EPAM now serves customers from more than 50 countries around the world, which means we just doubled our country count in the last 3 years. And as a result, replenished our delivery platform across now 4 major geographies, which includes Central and Eastern Europe, India, Western and Central Asia and Latin America. Today's reach also didn't exist for us just a few years back.\nToday, with those efforts and accelerated growth outside of impacted regions, we have reduced our delivery capacity there from roughly 60% in February of 2022 to 40% now. And we expect to reach a level of close to 30% in to the second half of 2022. Part of this process, we are well underway in our commitment of our exiting our operations in Russia, where we moved quickly and anticipate completing the process shortly. We are still working through a number of regulatory requirements in the country, which means that the timing of full transition is still difficult to predict precisely.\nWith that said, we can share that our local footprint went from over 9,000 people at the end of Q1 to just under 1,000 today. With that, I would like to say a big thank you to many people within EPAM global delivery and talent management and the financial organizations at very different seniority levels, who are enabling this massive talent transformation efforts across dozens of countries simultaneously and under very challenging timelines. Thank you.\nMoving to also phase in the framework. Continuing to serve and expand demand for our services for our growing global customer portfolio. Over the last 5 months, we have repositioned absolute majority of all client projects who requested their work to be relocated based on their sense of risk mitigation factors. As we also know, that such requests will continue to happen in the future depending on the different fast developing external factors.\nWe just feel at this point, that we are much better prepared now to address such future needs. With this, I would like to state that while we continue to be extremely open and responsive to our customer needs and their preferences, we are seeing today some new incoming demand into the region and expect a significant proportion of our client portfolio, even with increased global diversification, to be continuously serviced from Ukraine and Belarus.\nAnother indication of our success in our third phase could be expressed by the growth of our top 20 and top 50 client portfolio. Most of them have been with us and stayed with us through multiple phases of change and growth. And thanks to their support today during such a huge and terrible disruption due to current war in Ukraine.\nFinally, the last element of our framework is a focus on profitability, or Phase 4. As work has been repositioned to new geographies, we have begun the effort to align rate structures and optimize the performance of new delivery locations. This will continue throughout this year and into 2023. While still too early to provide specifics on our progress on this phase, we believe we will return to profit levels approaching EPAM's historical ranges during the first half of 2023.\nIn addition to all of that, we continue to progress our investment agenda across several key areas. EPAM Continuum is now the consulting brand recognized by leading analysts and strongly supporting our growing focus on more complex and advisory led engagements. Our cloud and data offerings are progressing fast into large modernization programs, enabled by our strengthening relations with key partners in this space. And we continue to see traction with EPAM's efforts in our IP and educational initiatives as well as our advanced remote supply model, enabled by our continuously invented digital platforms.\nIn short, we feel good right now about our progress to date, of rebalancing our global delivery and moving forward with all other additional initiatives. This should allow us to maintain the sequential constant currency revenue growth rate, despite the massive disruption we have encountered.\nWith that, I would like to provide some comments on the current demand environment, or at least how we see it from our side. While we really are doing better today than we expected, we, like our competitors and all of you, see a growing number of mixed economic indicators and caution in the market. At the same time, we still believe the near-term demand environment remains intact. We also believe the medium-term broad-based demand trends, which have driven activity in our industry in the past will continue to support our ability to drive strong organic growth at or above our old normal 20% target.\nSo while we are not immune to the impact of the global economic events, we shall being much better positioned today than in the past to address any future shifts. And we also believe EPAM remains well positioned for long-term growth and value creation opportunities, for our people, for our clients and for our investors.\nTo summarize, our priority remains to contain, as much as possible, the impact of the current disruption of the war during 2022. We have made significant progress in this area over the last 5 months. And in addition, we are significantly accelerating key elements of our overall strategy. Because to big extent, other than the closing of our operation in Russia, what is happening right now and what we now call our new normal is very much the accelerated effort towards certain strategic directions, which have been part of our medium to longer-term plans.\nThe resilience of our people, customers and operations have effectively created accepting this new normal for EPAM, an entirely different level of diversification, productivity and agility of the business to ensure future growth in this constantly changing market environment.\nSo overall, these challenging times are helping us to build better and more adaptive EPAM, and faster. And in closing, as I mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, and it's worth repeating, EPAM as a company fully stands with Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, our absolute top priority has been and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. One more time, thank you to all of our employees for this effort and their loyalty during these not at all easy times.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q2 results and additional perspective as we look at Q3 and beyond.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, EPAM delivered another set of strong results, including a sooner-than-anticipated return to sequential revenue growth. These results were produced at a time when the company was experiencing unprecedented disruptions across all VPM's major delivery locations.\nAs we mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, in addition to our customary non-GAAP adjustments, expenditures related to EPAM's humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, the exit of our Russian operations and costs associated with accelerated employee relocations have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q2 earnings release.\nDuring Q2, EPAM generated revenues of $1.19 billion, a year-over-year increase of 35.6% on a reported basis and 40.1% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 450 basis points.\nLooking at the performance of our industry verticals and geographic regions in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the ongoing exit of our Russia operations and the effect of foreign exchange on our U.S. dollar reported results. Were helpful, I will provide an adjusted year-over-year conversion.\nBeginning with our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 61.1%, driven by strong organic growth, primarily from our retail customers as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions. Life sciences and healthcare grew 40.1%, with strong growth coming from the health care industry, in addition to growth in life sciences. Financial services grew 29.4%, with growth coming from asset management, payments and banking. Excluding our Russia customers, growth was 41.5% or 45.7% in constant currency.\nBusiness information & media delivered 25.4% growth in the quarter, driven primarily by customers in the business information industry. Software and hi-tech grew 22.7% in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 36.1% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. Excluding our Russian customers, growth was 40.6% or 49.1% in constant currency.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region representing 60% of our Q2 revenues, grew 36.8% year-over-year or 37.9% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 35% of our Q2 revenues, grew 45.2% year-over-year or 58% in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by strong organic growth, combined with the incremental contribution from recent acquisitions. CEE, representing 2% of our Q2 revenues, contracted 46.7% year-over-year or 58.2% in constant currency. Revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by the ramp down of services to our Russian customers. And finally, the APAC grew 20.8% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues. In Q2, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 27% year-over-year, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 41%.\nMoving down to the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 29.2% compared to 33.8% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31.5% compared to 35% for the same quarter last year. Compared to Q2 2021, risk margin in Q2 2022 was negatively impacted by the ongoing transition of customer work to higher-cost geographies as well as lower utilization in Russia.\nGAAP SG&A was 19.5% of revenue compared to 17.2% in Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.2% of revenue compared to 15.6% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $93 million or 7.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $125 million or 14.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. The lower level of profitability was primarily driven by costs associated with the exit of our Russian operations, relocation of our employees, and humanitarian expenditures and support for Ukrainian employees.\nNon-GAAP income from operations was $177 million or 14.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to $155 million or 17.6% of revenue in Q2 of last year. We are pleased with our operating profit in a quarter when the company was also executing a significant geographic transformation. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 114.9%, primarily driven by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation as well as a onetime deferred tax benefit associated with tax planning. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefits as well as onetime benefit from tax planning, was 22.9%.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.32, reflecting a negative $1.62 or 83.5% decrease year-over-year. GAAP EPS includes the impact of Ukraine and humanitarian expenditures, expenses related to accelerated staff relocations, costs related to the planned exit of our Russian operations and the FX impact of Russian ruble appreciation on the intercompany payables denominated in rubles and U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by our Russian entity. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.38, reflecting a $0.33 increase or 16.1% growth over the same quarter of 2021. In Q2, there were approximately 59 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $78 million compared to $69 million in the same quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $59 million compared to free cash flow of $46 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. At the end of Q2, DSO was 71 days when compared to 69 days for Q1 2022 and 70 days for the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO in and around this level throughout 2022.\nNow moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 54,850 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 28.1%. Our total headcount for Q2 was around 61,300 employees. Compared to Q1, we saw a net decrease of approximately 300 headcount. Significant additions in India, Central Europe and Latin America were offset by the reduction of headcount in Russia.\nUtilization was 78% compared to 80.2% in Q2 of last year and 78.4% in Q1 2022. Our Q2 utilization includes those employees who have been assigned in a backup capacity to support projects substantially delivered from Ukraine. Although these employees were accounted to utilize for the purpose of our utilization calculations, this work was largely unbilled. Additionally, during the quarter, utilization in Russia was significantly lower compared to the same quarter of 2021. Utilization in Ukraine remains steady in a level similar to, but somewhat lower than 2021.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. As a reminder, on February 28, we withdrew our full year business outlook due to the uncertainties related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For the remainder of this year, we plan to provide guidance for the next quarter only and expect to resume our full year guidance at the beginning of the 2023 year. However, I will provide some additional insights and assumptions which will help frame our Q3 guidance and expectations for the second half of 2022.\nAt this time, we continue to see a stable demand environment, which, combined with the progress in repositioning our workforce and portfolio, we expect will drive continued sequential revenue growth throughout the second half of 2022. However, with our reduced Russian customer revenue, we expect to see the impacts of tougher year-over-year revenue comparisons in both Q3 and Q4. We will continue to provide color regarding the impact the Russia exit has on EPAM's growth rates.\nWe continue to see relatively high levels of productivity from our Ukrainian staff who were substantially located in the safer portions of the country. Our Q3 guidance assumes that we will maintain Ukrainian utilization levels only slightly lower than pre-war levels. Those Russian employees who wanted to relocate, we have relocated the majority of that population during the second quarter. Therefore, we expect a lower level of employee relocations in Q3.\nParallel with the repositioning of our people, we are working through the process to align our cost and rate structures to reflect the prevailing economics in the geographies to which demand has been redirected. In many cases, the result will be increased billing rates to reflect higher costs, although we expect some lag in the establishment of these higher bill rates.\nThe movement in customers, projects and people, we expect some short-term inefficiencies, including a higher level of bench, and therefore, a somewhat lower utilization as we scale new and existing delivery locations. The combination of these factors will continue to weigh on our profitability. However, we expect to see an improvement in profitability between Q2 and Q3 and are currently forecasting profitability in Q4 at levels similar to those we expect to achieve in Q3.\nAnd finally, today, EPAM has spent over $34 million as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to our Ukrainian employees and their families. We expect further humanitarian expenditures will be made throughout 2022 and into 2023.\nNow moving to our Q3 2022 outlook. We expect revenues to be at least $1.210 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of at least 22%. In constant currency terms, revenue growth is expected to be at least 26%. Included in these growth rates is approximately 400 basis points of revenue contribution from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months. I will also point out that we expect customers based in Russia to contribute less than $10 million in revenues in the quarter compared with the $44 million in Russia-based customer revenues generated in Q3 of 2021.\nFor the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $1.65 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $2.48 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.4 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the third quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $38 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.7 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be negligible. Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $13.6 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $5.9 million in the quarter.\nIn addition to these customary GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, and consistent with Q2, we expect to have ongoing non-GAAP adjustments in Q3 resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q2 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.\nWe're pleased with our Q2 performance, which is the result of a lot of hard work by our employees around the globe, whom I want to thank for their dedication and the world-class service that they provide to our customers.\nOperator, let's open the call for questions."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the EPAM Systems First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker host, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of IR, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.

If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section.\nWith me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings material located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I'll now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nDuring our previous earnings call, I finished my remarks with our assurance that the level of maturity that the EPAM has reached over the last few years, along with our ability to operate and manage our performance during the difficult times in 2014 and '15 in Ukraine and 2020 and '21 in Belarus, allows us to say that we were well prepared to address the potential challenges of 2022 by leveraging our broad global reach and deep regional insight and by applying our strong engineering DNA, and most importantly, our never-ending entrepreneurial spirit to continue making the future real for our clients, our employees and our global and local communities while keeping everybody as safe as possible.\nWe're (inaudible). We didn't expect the war. By any measurement, the quarter has been unlike any other quarter in our history. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the world and impacted tens of millions of people, including tens of thousands of our employees, their families, friends, neighbors in Ukraine and around the world. What we thought was unimaginable when we reported our Q4 earnings on February 17, all changed a week later.\nNow let me repeat a simple statement. EPAM, as a company, fully stands with Ukraine. During the last months since the beginning of the war that was started by the Russian government, our absolute top priority has been and continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and their families in Ukraine.\nToday, our employees in the region and around the globe continue to support each other, donating time and resources to help their colleagues in Ukraine. Additionally, the company has provided significant financial and logistical support to help move our Ukrainian employees and their families to safe areas inside and outside of Ukraine.\nAs we have previously announced, EPAM has committed USD 100 million in assistance to help with the broad range of needs for our people and their close ones. Along this financial assistance, there has been an outpouring of support from a great number of clients and partners responding with gestures and different type of aids.\nThinking more broadly about the people of Ukraine, we established the EPAM Ukraine Assistance Fund to support charitable aid organizations that provide direct relief to those in vulnerable situation across Ukraine. This fund is a separate from and in addition to the $100 million humanitarian commitment previously mentioned.\nAnd despite the very challenging and sometimes unimaginable conditions on the ground in Ukraine, our Ukrainian colleagues have been resilient and dedicated to their work and customer responsibilities, continuing to produce and to deliver results. EPAM's management team, together with our clients, are extremely impressed and grateful for those incredible efforts and we see today increased interest from our customers to continue directing work to Ukraine. I personally want to thank each and everyone on our Ukrainian team.\nHowever, where we get it wrong, we were also somehow right about our level of readiness to address unknown. Because today, despite the broad and disruptive nature of the events unfolding daily, we find ourselves to be better prepared than we imagined just 3 months ago. Our investments in hardening our operational and logistical platforms, teams and processes have enabled us to respond quickly and establish a framework for continued phased recovery procedures. Let us try to illustrate it in a bit more structured way by presenting several stages of our current journey or at least the way we are currently thinking about things.\nFirst, in addition to preserving the safety of our Ukrainian EPAMers and their families while helping to move many thousands of people from east to west inside the country and abroad, our initial focus during the last few months has been on maintaining our customer relationships and continue to deliver important initiatives despite the war and interrelated geopolitical challenges. Those efforts we define for ourselves as a Phase 1, a period of safety and stabilization of our operations, with very little attention to anything beyond that. Under the current conditions, we believe this phase is largely completed and we will call it out as a notable success. Jason will illustrate in more details the specific numbers for our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 shortly.\nSo while we are managing through the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, we're also working with our customers to address their concerns and request to reposition projects and teams to different geographies, which is very much guided by the business continuity plans we had previously established with our clients, including multiple relocation alternatives for our employees.\nIn April, we also made the decision to exit our operations in Russia, which is in step with the market and the broader global response to the actions of the Russian government. We are fully committed to our talent in Russia who share our values and our position. And for most of our employees in the region, we are working multiple relocation alternatives to allow them to remain with the company and advance their careers at EPAM. This statement brings us to what we consider to be a Phase 2, which is our activities to accelerate the diversification for rebalancing, if you will, of our global locations and continued growth of our delivery capabilities.\nWe have already begun the second phase, which closed the overlaps with the Phase 1. This acceleration includes rapidly scaling already existing delivery locations in India, Latin America and Central Asia as well as establishing several newly created delivery hubs and expanding many existing across Europe. This expansion supports active repositioning of our current employees and simultaneously creates opportunity to develop the local talent market in those hub locations. This will allow us to maintain the experienced delivery talent we currently have while also establishing new delivery footprints and allowing for significant increases in local hiring and better facilitating future growth in those locations. At this point, we can report that this development is in play already and we're seeing early success. We will continue to update you on our progress on those efforts throughout the year.\nI would also point out that in large part, this diversification program was well underway even during the past several years. Before COVID, our allocation to the talent from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia was close to 70% of our total production capacity. By the end of 2021, it was less than 60%. And we believe, by the end of 2022, we will manage to reduce the allocation of our production staff in the region to about 30%.\nAdditionally, we have a strong intention to maintain and potentially grow our talent pool in Ukraine, which we believe will continue to be a significant IT talent market post war.\nWhile the size and scale of this disruption has been very significant and while we still should expect some very much unexpected things to happen, I think it's important to bring context that the rest of our business and customer portfolio continue to operate in a business-as-usual manner. The longer-term demand trends that have driven growth in our business before remains very much intact. We believe these trends, combined with our unique offerings, enabled by our differentiated engineering DNA and market positioning, will place us [on the path] to our familiar organic revenue growth profile sooner rather than later.\nAnd this brings us to what we call Phase 3, the period to focus on the revenue demand. This phase is also underway and will occur in parallel with 2 phases we described above. What this means is that we are focusing on revenue growth for new and existing customers and starting to operate in type of new normal environment for us. We believe that this new normal should elevate us back to sequential revenue growth during the second half of 2022.\nAfter that, we believe we will be able to enter Phase 4 of our recovery plan, which will be time to focus on profitability, with the objective to return to profit levels consistent with EPAM historical target ranges. This will show an important area of attention on our agenda already today, but we plan to have a stronger focus on profitability as well as on improving rate structures and optimizing performance of our new delivery locations throughout the second half of 2022 to show visible performance improvements while this phase will likely carry on into 2023.\nI think it's very much understandable that all the phases I just outlined are not sequential, and while many elements of these efforts, however, lacking in time, they also are very much interrelated and bring a high level of operational complexity into our day-to-day activities.\nAt the same time, it's also important to underscore that the first 2 phases are already very much underway, and the next 2 phases are just getting started, that all phases will continue to be present in our life for some time.\nTo summarize. While the cause of this disruption is beyond our control, today we are responding at a scale in a place to put our best effort together to contain as much as possible the impact of this war within 2022. Our new strategy is not really new, but an acceleration of our previously stated strategy: adapt, grow and deliver value across a broader, more engaged ecosystem of people, customers and partners.\nBased on our inherent heritage, tightly integrated with innovation and transformational consulting capabilities, we're developing over the last years, we will return to industry-leading growth and a more in line profitability model while still challenging ourselves in doubling the company's 2021 revenue in 3 years' time, as we have done previously 3 times since our IPO in 2012.\nI'm confident we will execute through this unimaginable challenge and emerge as a more diverse, more resilient and more relevant EPAM.\nI hope you will be able to join our Investor and Analyst Day event on May 19 in Boston, where we will share more insights in our plans and goals.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jason, who will talk about our Q1 results and additional perspective as we look at Q2 and beyond.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the first quarter, EPAM delivered strong results despite the impact of the company's decision in March to discontinue services to customers based in Russia.\nIn Q1, we also incurred some of the initial costs resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the acceleration of our geographic diversification strategy. Certain of these costs, including the expenditures related to EPAM's humanitarian commitment to Ukraine, charges for impairment of Russian long-lived assets and costs associated with accelerated employee relocation have been excluded from non-GAAP financial results. We have included additional disclosures specific to these and other related items in our Q1 earnings release.\nDuring the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.17 billion, a year-over-year increase of 50.1% on a reported basis and 53% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 290 basis points.\nLooking at the performance of our industry verticals in the quarter, travel & consumer grew 90.9% driven by strong organic growth from both our retail and travel customers as well as revenue contributions from recent acquisitions.\nFinancial services grew 54%, with very strong broad-based growth coming from asset management, insurance and banking. Life sciences & healthcare grew 35.9%. Business information & media delivered 31.5% growth in the quarter. Software & hi-tech grew 28.8% in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 59.4% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas, our largest region, representing 59% of our Q1 revenues, grew 46% year-over-year or 46.5% in constant currency. EMEA representing 36% of our Q1 revenues, grew 62.7% year-over-year or 68.1% in constant currency. EMEA performance was driven by strong organic growth, combined with an incremental contribution from recent acquisitions.\nCEE, representing 3% of our Q1 revenues, grew 10.5% year-over-year and 30.6% in constant currency. Growth in the quarter was reduced by the initial impact of the discontinuance of services to our customers located in Russia.\nAnd finally, APAC grew 41.2% year-over-year or 41.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues.\nIn Q1, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 32% year-over-year while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 63%.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.4% compared to 33.5% in Q1 of last year.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for the same quarter last year.\nGross margin in Q1 2022 was negatively impacted by the inability to recognize revenue resulting from work done for certain of our Russian customers as well as lower utilization in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nGAAP SG&A was 20.3% of revenue compared to 17.5% in Q1 of last year.\nAnd non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 15.5% in the same period last year. SG&A in the quarter reflected a higher level of bad debt, largely driven by a higher level of reserves associated with our customers located in Russia.\nGAAP income from operations was $129 million or 11% of revenue in the quarter compared to $107 million or 13.7% of revenue in Q1 of last year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations was $189 million or 16.1% of revenue in the quarter compared to $137 million or 17.5% of revenue in Q1 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 23.9% and includes a onetime charge related to certain tax credits.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.52, reflecting a $0.34 decline or 18.3% decrease year-over-year.\nGAAP EPS includes the impact of Ukrainian humanitarian expenditures, charges related to the impairment of Russian long-lived assets, expenses related to accelerated staff relocation and losses on the Russian ruble forward contracts that were unwound in the quarter.\nOur non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.49, reflecting a $0.68 increase or 37.6% growth over the same quarter in 2021.\nIn Q1, there were approximately 58.9 million diluted shares outstanding.\nNow turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was a net cash outflow of $51.8 million compared to a net cash inflow of $13 million in the same quarter of 2021. Q1 cash flow was negatively impacted by expenditures related to our Ukrainian humanitarian support initiative and the payment of a higher level of company-wide variable compensation based on our 2021 performance. We also accelerated the timing of variable compensation payments with a higher proportion paid in Q1 than in prior years.\nFree cash flow was negative $75.1 million compared to positive free cash flow of $2 million in the same quarter last year.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nAt the end of Q1, DSO was 69 days and compares to 62 days for Q4 2021 and 67 days for the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO slightly above current levels throughout 2022.\nNow moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 55,050 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 41.8%. Our total headcount for Q1 was around 61,600 employees. In the quarter, we had approximately 2,800 net additions. Production headcount growth was negatively impacted by lower-than-planned growth in Ukraine and an actual reduction in Russia-based production headcount. We continue to experience accelerated growth in production headcount in countries other than Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.\nUtilization was 78.4% compared to 81.4% in Q1 of last year and 76.8% in Q4 2021. Our Q1 utilization includes those employees who have been assigned in a backup capacity to support projects substantially delivered from Ukraine. Although these employees were counted as utilized for the purpose of our utilization calculations, this work was largely unbilled. Utilization in Ukraine did decline somewhat on a year-over-year basis but is being maintained at extremely high levels considering the current operating environment.\nNow let's turn to our business outlook. On February 28, we withdrew our business outlook due to the uncertainties related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For the remainder of this year, we plan to provide guidance for the next quarter only, with the expectation of resuming our full year guidance at the beginning of the 2023 year.\nAdditionally, to help align with our thinking around significant events, let me provide a few broad assumptions which will help frame our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of 2022.\nRussian aggression continues to take a terrible pull on Ukraine, but most of the fighting is currently concentrated in the eastern portion of the country. We continue to see relatively high levels of productivity from our Ukrainian staff who are substantially located in safer portions of the country. Our Q2 guidance assumes that we will maintain Ukrainian utilization at slightly lower levels than those experienced in Q1.\nDuring the initial weeks of invasion, we were able to relocate approximately 2,000 employees out of the country where they are safe and productive. EPAM has spent over $25 million so far as part of the company's $100 million humanitarian commitment to Ukraine and the Ukrainian employees and their families. Further, humanitarian expenditures will be made in Q2 and throughout the remainder of the year.\nTo date, we have relocated significant numbers of our Russian employees to delivery locations outside of Russia and we expect to relocate more of our Russian employees throughout Q2. Employees relocated outside of Russia are being moved to fill billable positions and are expected to be billable in their destination countries. However, during Q2, we expect that lower levels of demand for Russia-based resources will result in considerably lower utilization levels for those staff remaining in the country.\nAt this time, we are planning to maintain operations in Belarus. However, we expect a lower level of utilization as we execute business continuity plans for a defined number of clients who would like us to deliver from countries other than Belarus.\nIn parallel with the repositioning of our people, we have begun the effort to align our cost and rate structures to reflect the prevailing economics in the geographies to which demand has been redirected. In many cases, the result will be increasing billing rates to reflect higher costs, although we expect some lag in the establishment of these higher bill rates. Additionally, we expect some short-term inefficiencies as we scale newer delivery locations. The combination of these factors will put downward pressure on our profitability in Q2.\nHowever, we expect to see ongoing improvement in profitability in the second half of 2022, with the return to something closer to our historical levels of profitability in the first half of 2023.\nLastly, based on the continued strong demand, stability in our customer portfolio and progress in accelerating our global diversification, we expect to return to positive sequential revenue growth in the second half of 2022.\nNow moving on to our Q2 2022 outlook. We expect revenues to be at least $1.14 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of at least 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue growth is expected to be at least 34%. Included in these growth rates is approximately 600 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months.\nFor the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 10% to 12%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $0.73 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be at least $1.70 for the quarter.\nWe expect a weighted average share count of 59.5 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $27.5 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $6 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss. Tax effect to non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $16.5 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $4 million in the quarter.\nIn addition to these traditional GAAP to non-GAAP measurements, consistent with Q1, we will have additional non-GAAP adjustments in Q2 that are a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Please see our Q1 earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.\nIn summary, despite a challenging March, we are pleased with our Q1 results. In Q2 and for the remainder of the year, EPAM will continue to focus on the geographic repositioning of our company. Then in the second half of the year, we expect to see both improving profitability and a return to sequential growth.\nNow I would like to take this opportunity to thank all EPAMers, but particularly those EPAMers working from Ukraine. It is hard to imagine living through all that you're living through and still doing all that is necessary to meet delivery obligations and sustain EPAM operations in the country. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your families. I also have a huge amount of respect for all of you.\nOperator, let's open the call up for questions."

Welcome to the EPAM Systems Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Straube, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Straube\n\nHead of IR, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. If you have not, a copy is available on epam.com in the Investors section. With me on today's call are Arkadiy Dobkin, CEO and President; and Jason Peterson, Chief Financial Officer.\nI would like to remind those listening that some of the comments made on today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and SEC filings. Additionally, all references to reported results that are non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures and are available in our quarterly earnings material located in the Investors section of our website.\nWith that said, I will now turn the call over to Ark.\n\nArkadiy Dobkin\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & President, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to Jason to provide a detailed update on our fourth quarter overall 2021 results and our 2022 outlook, I would like to spend some time reflecting on last year performance and share some thoughts on our positioning for 2022. But even before doing that, I would like to share a couple of other thoughts.\nJust last week, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. So that is why this call is a bit special. Exactly 10 years ago, we provided our first guidance on our first earnings call.\nEPAM in Q1 2012 was a company with 7,000 people and about $335 million in revenue. [We recall] back then, which reflected a strong [priority] indeed. EPAM was very much an unknown start-up with a minimal presence in the United States and Western Europe and with development centers across just a few countries in Eastern Europe. And we were extremely nervous because of all of that.\nDuring our first call, we shared that our quarterly revenue grew 34% and our annual headcount increased by about 30%. And we guided that our 2012 revenue should go up around 23%, 25% from the prior year of 2011. Ten years later, we are a very different company. Since our IPO, EPAM has grown more than tenfold, expanded our global footprint across 5 continents and growing our team of professionals to more than 58,000 people and across 40 countries to become a recognized world leader in digital engineering and consulting services.\nSo at this moment, I would like to personally thank all of our employees, customers and shareholders who participated in achieving this notable milestone in EPAM journey, which we just deliberated last week on New York Stock Exchange podium, unfortunately, in a very small team due to understandable [quality restriction].\nWhat is also important is that 10 years later, we still feel very much as a fast-growing, constantly changing and learning start-up. As of today, we still can share that in our fourth quarter, we grew 53% and 44% organically, increased our annual head count by 43% and plan to grow revenues by at least 37% in 2022. So in short, we are running today faster than we did back then during our first post IPO days.\nTo be on a bit more formal side, for 2021, we generated almost $3.8 billion in revenues, reflecting a greater than 40% year-over-year growth, which included a strong result across all dimensions of our portfolio. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $9.05, a 43% increase over fiscal 2020. And in 2021, we also generated $461 million of free cash flow.\nDuring our previous call 3 months ago, we shared the history of our transformational efforts while we were setting our 3-year mission plans. I will not go into the details again, but I would like to mention that 2021 was actually a special year for us. For the third time in a row since our IPO, we doubled the company in 3 years.\n2021 was a year when we were aggressively building and expanding EPAM capabilities through our strong organic [efforts], especially across cloud data and consulting credits. And also, it was a record year from an M&A point of view, which help us to [fuel] some white spaces and also to mature our offerings in consulting, cybersecurity, digital marketing, digital platform and cloud delivery as well as in data and analytics. It also allows to better diversify our global delivery organization.\nFor sure, our 2021 results would not have been possible if not for our ability to attract and retain talent. To meet the extraordinary demand in 2021, we refined our employee value proposition, to elevate EPAM as a [company] with new-generation technologies where engineers, designers, architects and consultants can embrace modern practices, cutting-edge tech and deep collaboration approach during our client engagement.\nWe added more than 17,600 EPAMers, which is approximately 2.5x more employees in our previous record year of 2019. 2021 was the second year in a row of very much distributed with very high percentage of remote work, and with still very limited opportunities to meet in person with our team members and clients on a regular basis.\nSo it was a year when we doubled our efforts to focus on talent engagement practices through understanding of people capabilities, investing in their training and development and providing a wide area of opportunities to communicate and gather together (inaudible) as a team as well as through finding the best suitable engagement both from professional and from [vocational] point of view.\nAdditionally, we drove deeper connections across our global talent pool to each other and to global community of people and partners through our digital platforms, all which help us to keep high level of productivity and our attrition levels manageable in the current very challenging environment.\nIn 2021, the majority of our clients have been at the center of significant amount of transformation. This has driven very strong demand for our services across all verticals. In travel and consumer, we absorbed an extra rebound as post-pandemic priorities once again moved to the forefront of the discretionary spend agenda.\nIn financial services, we saw demand growth in both our existing customers and in several new and previously smaller clients. We'll continue the same of modernization and innovation of key business domains. Insurance, which was relatively new focus area within our financial services last year is today one of our fastest-growing subsegments. Telecommunications, automotive, all part of our emerging verticals (inaudible) outpace previous year performance as clients in these sectors turn to EPAM's expertise and innovation, design experience and product and platform in (inaudible).\nLife sciences & healthcare and software & hi-tech both continue to grow fast and demonstrating the potential to accelerate fast. While business information & media slowed down during the year, returned to a 30-plus percent growth rate in Q4.\n2021 was also a noticeable year from a market recognition point of view. Some of them we shared previously, but I would list those together to demonstrate the progress we achieved or being not only the engineers anymore, but moving beyond into the integrated consulting and advanced engineering zone.\nEPAM was ranked as a top IT services company on Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list for the third consecutive year and also was included on the list of Forbes Global 2000 companies; recognized by Ad Age as one of the top 25 largest agencies in the world; and Consulting Magazine named EPAM Continuum as one of the top 20 fastest-growing consultancies; also included by Forrester as EPAM Continuum in the list of 8 largest customer experience strategy consulting practices, along with Accenture, BCG, Deloitte, E&Y (sic) [EY], IBM, McKinsey and PwC; named in top 50 most loved workplaces by Newsweek; recognized for our employee-centric work by Great Place to Work in a number of our key talent markets; and was also awarded the Best Culture of Learning Talent by LinkedIn. Just last week was included in the top 100 Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list. And lastly, was accepted in S&P 500 Index in December.\nJust several quarters ago, in last May actually, we talked probably for the first time about becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion company sometime in the future. Today, we know that we are guiding to close the $5 billion mark already in 2022. So we feel much more confident to set our near-term sights on growing to $10 billion [floor] company.\nWe believe we are well positioned to do so with our overall progress today, and we continue advancing on our key client markets and growing a very fast, diversifying global delivery capabilities. I know it feels like I'm missing 1 hot topic at this point. And I am sure that you follow the news about Ukraine and Russia as much as we do. That is why I would like to share the following before passing the microphone to Jason.\n2021 was actually a very challenging year, especially for us. First, due to fast-growing geopolitical and social uncertainties across some of our key talent markets and the continued disruption of global pandemic too. That is exactly why we are very pleased with our standing in first quarter and overall performance we delivered in 2021. Despite all of that, our results demonstrate the level of maturity published over the years and our ability to operate [and win share] performance during difficult times. We also should remember that this conflict is not new for the region. We do well remember 2014 and 2015 and then 2020 as well. We have dealt well with those in the past, and we also learned a lot since then.\nSo in 2021, to navigate the situation, we continued something which we started actively implementing since 2014. Both organic and M&A-based efforts to improve our geographic timing diversification and to do it without any degradation in quality of our delivery. That was our key focus over those years as well as significantly maturing our portfolio of consulting industry and overall engineering capabilities.\nSo today, we believe we are well prepared to address the challenges ahead in 2022 by leveraging our broad global reach in addition to our deep regional insight and by applying our strong engineering DNA and very importantly, [never ending] entrepreneurial spirit to continue making [the future real] for our clients, our employees and our global and local communities while keeping everyone as safe as possible as our key priority at the same time.\nWith that, I would like one more time to thank our employees, customers and shareholders for their continued understanding and support. Now let me turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason Peterson\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, EPAM Systems, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ark, and good day to all. In the fourth quarter, EPAM delivered extremely strong results, reflecting continued high levels of demand for the company's services across a full range of industry verticals and geographies. During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $1.107 billion, a year-over-year increase of 53.1% on a reported basis and 54.1% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 100 basis points.\nQ4 was the first quarter EPAM delivered quarterly revenues in excess of $1 billion, a notable milestone in the company's journey. Performance across the industry verticals in the quarter was consistent and very strong, long-standing trends, which have been driving significant growth continue and include the need to modernize and transform applications while transitioning them to the cloud. Human-centered innovation is the merging of physical and digital experiences continues to spread across industries and creation of new digital products and businesses, while harnessing the resulting data to improve our customers' revenue growth, supply chain operations and end customer experiences.\nTurning to the performance of our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 91.3%, driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients. The accelerated growth in the quarter is partially the result of recent acquisitions. Financial services grew 60.3% with very strong growth coming from payments, banking, asset management and insurance. Larger consulting-led engagements are helping to drive higher levels of growth.\nSoftware & hi-tech grew 34.7% in the quarter. Life sciences & healthcare grew 33.9%. Business information & media delivered 32.9% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 67.6% growth, driven by clients in manufacturing and automotive, energy and telecommunications.\nMoving to our geographic performance. In Q4, we renamed our geographic regions to better reflect EPAM's ongoing geographic expansion. These changes are [name only], the methodology used to report revenues remains unchanged.\nThe Americas, our largest region, representing 58% of our Q4 revenues, grew 47.2% year-over-year or 47.4% in constant currency. EMEA, representing 35% of Q4 revenues, grew 66.6% year-over-year or 69.7% in constant currency. The accelerated growth in the quarter is partially the result of recent acquisitions. CEE, representing 5% of our Q4 revenues, grew 46.4% year-over-year and 43.9% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 38% year-over-year and 38% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues.\nIn Q4, revenues from our top 20 clients grew 29% while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 70% year-over-year, driving greater diversification across our revenue base. Growth in our clients outside of the top 20, most notably below the top 200, reflected a higher level of inorganic contribution during the quarter.\nMoving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.3% compared to 35.6% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.9% compared to 36.9% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q4 2021 was impacted by higher levels of funding for our variable compensation programs, given the company's outperformance versus financial targets established at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year.\nGAAP SG&A was 17.2% of revenue compared to 17.8% in Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 16.2% in the same period last year. GAAP income from operations was $166 million or 15% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $112 million or 15.5% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $206 million or 18.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to $136 million or 18.8% of revenue in Q4 of last year.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 11% versus our Q4 guide of 14% due to a higher-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.40, Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.76, reflecting a $0.95 increase and 52.5% growth over the same quarter in 2020. In Q4, there were approximately 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $285 million compared to $159 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow of $228 million produced a 139% conversion of adjusted net income, compared to free cash flow of $141 million in the same quarter last year. The higher level of free cash flow in the quarter reflects a strong level of cash collections. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which is net of $366 million used in our acquisition efforts during 2021.\nAt the end of Q4, DSO was [62] and compares to 70 days in Q3 2021 and 64 days in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, we expect DSO will trend up in 2022.\nMoving on to a few operational metrics for the quarter. We ended Q4 with more than 52,600 consultants, designers, engineers, trainers and architects, a year-over-year increase of 43.2%. Our total headcount for the quarter was more than 58,800 employees. In Q4, we had approximately 6,100 net additions, a record number of new additions for EPAM. Utilization was 76.8% compared to 77.9% in Q4 of last year and 77.1% in Q3 2021.\nTurning to our results for 2021. Revenues for the year were $3.758 billion, producing 41.3% reported growth and 39.9% on a constant currency basis when compared to 2020. During fiscal 2021, our acquisitions contributed approximately 4% to our growth.\nGAAP income from operations was $542 million, an increase of 43% year-over-year and represented 14.4% of revenues. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $678 million, an increase of 43.5% over the prior year and represented 18% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 9.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%.\nDiluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $8.15. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain onetime items was $9.05, reflecting a 42.7% increase over fiscal 2020. In 2021, there were approximately 59.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And finally, cash flow from operations was $572 million compared to $544 million for 2020. And free cash flow was $461 million, reflecting an 86% adjusted net income conversion.\nWe are very pleased with our 2021 results, which exceeded each of the guided metrics we set at the beginning of the year. Before I move on to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few highlights on our progress in the area of corporate responsibility and ESG. EPAM has a long-standing commitment to serve the communities in which our people and our customers operate. As we continue to expand, we recognize our responsibility to act according to our principles by operating ethically, protecting the environment and supporting our global and local communities. Our focus on sustainable growth today will be a catalyst to fuel continued expansion in the future.\nOver the last year, EPAMers have donated more than 30,000 hours of their time and skills across 27 EPAM sites and partner organization events, creating and conducting STEM-related courses, supporting social innovation platforms and environmental initiatives and supporting events, including the British Interactive Media Association's Digital Day, the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Coolest Projects and the global Scratch Conference.\nWhile we are working through specific long-term commitments to fight climate change, we have continued to challenge ourselves to significantly reduce the effects of our carbon emissions. We're also focused on innovating new sustainability concepts and developing digital solutions to support sustainability in our communities.\nNow let's turn to guidance. Starting with our full year outlook, revenue growth will be at least 37% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms will be at least 38% after factoring in an approximate 1% negative foreign exchange impact. We expect inorganic revenue contribution to be approximately 6% from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.\nWe expect GAAP income operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 15%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will be 22%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect that GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $10.43 to $10.76 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will be in the range of $11.36 to $11.69 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nFor Q1 of 2022, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.180 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 50% reported at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance reflects unfavorable FX impact of 1% and the year-over-year growth rate on a constant currency basis is expected to be 51%. Lastly, we expect approximately 9% of our growth to come from revenues contributed by acquisitions closed over the last 12 months.\nFor the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 8% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to be approximately 22%.\nFor earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.73 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.66 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.5 million diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in 2022. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $116 million with $19 million in Q1, $31 million in Q2 and $33 million in the remaining quarters.\nAmortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $24 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $6 million loss for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $27 million for the year, with $4 million in Q1, $7 million in Q2 and $8 million in each remaining quarter.\nAnd finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $67 million for the full year with approximately $27 million in Q1, $18 million in Q2 and $11 million in each remaining quarter. Our 2022 outlook reflects the strong demand environment we see across the business and end markets we serve. In addition to expected ongoing investments across our people, platforms and processes, which will equip and position EPAM for future growth.\nAs we've done in the past, we will adjust our business outlook each quarter to reflect changes in the demand environment and in our operations. Okay, operator, let's open the call for questions."

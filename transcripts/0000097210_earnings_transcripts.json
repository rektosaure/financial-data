[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Amy McAndrews, VP of Corporate Relations for Teradyne. Please go ahead.\n\nAmy McAndrews\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for the third quarter of 2025 and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. The slides as well as a copy of this earnings script are available on the Investor page of the Teradyne website. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.\nThe matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We caution listeners not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this presentation. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the slides accompanying this presentation as well as the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, on file with the SEC. Additionally, these forward-looking statements are made only as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except to the extent required by law.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in the UBS Technology Investor Conference. Our quiet period will begin at the close of business on December 24, 2025. Following Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour.\nGreg?\n\nGregory Stephen Smith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, talk a bit about what is driving the business in Q4 and provide a general update on conditions across our businesses. Sanjay will then provide more detail on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance.\nAs you saw in the earnings release, we grew sequential revenue 18% and non-GAAP EPS by 49% in the third quarter. This growth was driven by AI demand in semiconductor tests. Our other test businesses delivered on plan in the quarter. In Robotics, we continue a slow crawl up from our Q1 revenue trough in a challenging environment. The huge investments in cloud AI build-out drove our Q3 performance to the high end of our guidance range as our customers ramped production of a wide range of AI accelerator, networking, memory and power devices. An example of this AI strength is in compute, where our view of the second half of 2025 revenue is more than 50% higher than our expectations just 3 months ago. Some of this increase comes from us responding to customer pulling requests and some is demand increases. As design, process and packaging technologies for AI compute rapidly advanced, we expect that our growth will continue. Our UltraFLEXplus system has been architected from the ground up for high-performance processors and networking devices, which have demanding power, pin count and test data requirements. As AI devices become more complex, the UltraFLEXplus architectural advantages become more valuable to potential customers by enabling fast test development times and high-efficiency volume production.\nOur focused investment in R&D is also yielding new differentiated capabilities for compute tests, some of which have been already been announced in Q3. In memory, our Q3 memory test sales more than doubled from Q2 to $128 million, with the majority of those shipments supporting AI applications. In Q3, 75% of our memory revenue was driven by DRAM, nearly all of it from final test of DRAM and HBM performance test. 25% of revenue was from flash mainly for cloud SSD, another segment being driven by AI data centers. Our Magnum [ 7H ] product is differentiated in HBM performance test because it is a multi-generational product. It can cover the test needs of HBM3E and HBM4, and it provides upgrade headroom for HBM4E and HBM5. The Magnum 7H also supports HBM singulated stack performance test. In Q2, we won a design in for this insertion. And in Q3, we began volume shipments. So at this point, Teradyne participates in all major test insertions for HBM, memory die wafer sort, post stack wafer test and singulated stack test. Our results in memory test this year are especially satisfying in light of the composition and size of the memory [ TAM ] for 2025. Our best guess is that the total memory TAM for 2025 will be down low double digits, and the weakest part of this market is flash, our traditional strongest segment. Despite this, we expect our memory revenue will sustain at 2024 levels.\nAI-driven applications for power ICs were a bright spot in the auto industrial market segment. The Eagle Test platform has a leading position in the test of high-performance power conversion devices for data center applications. Volumes of these devices are forecast to grow over 50% between now and 2027. We expect the demand for VIP compute and networking to continue to grow significantly, and we have been investing R&D, applications, sales, support and manufacturing capacity for this expansion. This includes investments to win new VIP and merchant GPU customers. We're making good progress on new design and opportunities and are cautiously optimistic about our potential success. But I would like to make it clear that our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance do not include any revenue from these types of new opportunities. For the deployed fleet of UltraFLEX and UltraFLEXplus testers, we see higher utilization and fewer system upgrades than in past quarters, which we believe means that customers are exhausting their inventory of underutilized systems. As a result, we now expect a more direct connection between inflection in end market demand and new system sales.\nLooking beyond AI and Semi Test, conditions in mobile and auto industrial remained somewhat weak. Now in our Integrated Systems division, our Q3 shipments were above plan as SLT customers accelerated deliveries for mobile processors and compute applications. We also saw increases in orders for both HDD and SLT systems. Now recall, lead times are generally measured in quarters for this business, so most of that order strength will translate into revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nIn robotics, we are growing slowly from our trough quarter in Q1 2025. If you go down 1 level of detail, we continue to see persistent weakness in our core indirect distribution channel as we expand our large customer and OEM channels. An important element of our robotics strategy is to establish UR cobots as the preferred platform for AI-driven work cell applications and to deliver superior performance for our AMRs by leveraging AI features. In the third quarter, over 8% of robotics sales were for AI-related products, up from 6% in Q2.\nAnother element of our robotics strategy is to deliver value-added service to our installed base of over 100,000 robots. Service represented 14% of sales in Q3, up from 12% in Q2. As we noted in our July call, our Semi Test business has evolved to where the largest demand driver is AI data center investments rather than consumer end markets. We have aligned our R&D and go-to-market investments to capture the tremendous opportunities in test driven by this AI related demand. Our investments are focused on extending our product performance advantages with innovative R&D, while also expanding our engineering teams to help customers develop and ramp production of these fantastically complex devices on Teradyne platforms. Sanjay will describe how these investments translate into OpEx, but as we're seeing, the returns are well worth the investment.\nLooking at Q4, we expect AI-related demand for compute, networking and memory to be the primary engine of our growth, which reflects both industry trends and the result of our investments to align with those trends. Looking to the future, the long-term themes that we've highlighted in the past, AI, verticalization and electrification remain firmly intact. As we enter 2026, we expect AI and verticalization will be the primary growth drivers. We've said before that the AI market is both highly concentrated and highly dynamic. The timing of any one project can affect the delivery schedule for hundreds of testers. This can swing quarterly results significantly.\nSo with that understanding, let me offer a few high-level comments about how we're looking at 2026. At the company level, 2026 looks stronger today than it did 6 months ago, and all indications suggest solid growth from 2025. We anticipate that business conditions for mobile, auto industrial and robotics will improve, but the timing and the intensity of that recovery is uncertain. But the real story in 2026 is AI and the investments that we have made to develop differentiated solutions in that space will drive our growth plan. I'd like to share a few specific examples.\nMassive investments in building data centers are translating into strong demand for UltraFLEXplus in VIP, compute, merchant compute and networking. In the memory market, AI will drive growth in HPM, DRAM and flash for SSD applications served by Magnum. Accelerated big growth in HDD is driving the demand for more HDD test. The deployment of AI-capable processors for mobile, client computing and cloud AI is driving the demand for more system-level test. We plan to give you a more detailed view as part of our model update in the January call.\nNow before I hand the call over to Sanjay, I would like to say a few words about the CFO transition that we announced last night. Michelle Turner will be our Chief Financial Officer effective November 3, 2025. She brings 30 years of financial and strategic leadership experience in the technology and manufacturing sectors, and she has a strong track record of driving growth, disciplined capital allocation and operational efficiency. She is looking forward to getting to know all of you in the upcoming quarter. I'm excited to welcome Michelle to the Teradyne team. Now Sanjay has been Teradyne's CFO since 2019, and he has offered to stay on as an executive adviser to operations as we expand capacity in 2026. I want to thank Sanjay for his excellent leadership and contributions over the past 6 years, and I'm grateful that we will have the benefit of this guidance.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3 and provide our Q4 outlook. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $769 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.85, both near the high end of our guidance ranges. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5%, above our guidance range due to favorable mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $293 million, up sequentially and year-over-year on higher R&D, sales and marketing investments tied to AI as well as increases in our variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating profit was 20.4%.\nTurning to our revenue breakdown in Q3. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $606 million, with SOC revenue contributing $440 million, which was up 11% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Memory revenue was $128 million, up 110% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Strength in [ SLC ] was driven by AI compute and AI-related power test. Memory revenue more than doubled from Q2 on HBM and AI-related LPDDR demand. IST revenue was $38 million, up 9% sequentially, 46% year-over-year driven by strength in SLT shipments. In product test, Q3 revenue was $88 million, up 4% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in defense and aerospace.\nNow to robotics. Revenue was $75 million, flat quarter-on-quarter and down year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $62 million and MiR contributed $13 million of revenue. As we noted in July, volume shipments to our large e-commerce customers are not expected to have a material impact on robotics revenue in 2025.\nSome other financial information in Q3. We had 2 customers that directly or indirectly, which drove more than 10% of our revenue in the third quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our free cash flow was $2 million. Our net income was offset by our net working capital increases tied to accounts receivable and inventory, which reduced our free cash flow. Receivables growth was tied to increased sales, which were weighted to the second half of the quarter. Inventory growth was tied to the ramp in compute and memory driven by upcoming AI demand. CapEx of $47 million was reasonably consistent with Q2. We repurchased $244 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. Through the end of the third quarter, we've returned $575 million or approximately 2.5x our free cash flow through dividends and buybacks to shareholders during the year. We ended the quarter with $427 million in cash and marketable securities.\nNow a little more detail on OpEx and our balance sheet strategy to help you with [ your modeling ]. In the second half of 2025, we're continuing to lean into R&D and go-to-market investments for AI opportunities that we expect will drive revenue in 2026 and beyond. OpEx in the second half of 2025 is also increasing tied to our variable compensation linked to increasing financial performance. At the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, we'll have full year revenue growth of 9% and OpEx growth of 7%. Long term, we target OpEx growth at approximately half the rate of our revenue growth. In 2026 and longer term, as AI revenue blossomed, we expect to meet our OpEx target.\nRegarding the balance sheet, we expect to keep our cash and marketable securities at roughly $400 million while also continuing our balanced capital allocation strategy. In 2025, we saw an opportunity to accelerate buybacks in the short term to further enable shareholder value. At the operational level, we expect to exercise our credit lines more frequently as we did in Q3 and expect to in Q4. From a modeling perspective, this means the interest and other line of the P&L will reflect higher interest expense. You should expect to see a couple of million dollars of net interest expense per quarter while we utilize our revolver.\nNow turning to our outlook for Q4. Before discussing the details of Q4 guidance, I'd like to remind you of some of the commentary from our July call. Specifically, we noted that we had large projects expected to ramp, which straddled Q3, Q4 or Q4, Q1. As we move through the second half of 2025, we saw projects accelerate into Q3 and are now seeing projects accelerate into Q4. These projects are [ AI drop ]. In Q3, we were able to meet early ramp demands. In Q4, we are seeing demand ramp significantly. We continue to expedite our supply chain, and we are accelerating production capacity growth at factories in multiple geographies to meet the demand.\nNow the details. Q4 sales are expected to be between $920 million and $1 billion. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. This includes some onetime supply costs in the quarter to meet accelerated demand.\nTurning to OpEx. Q4 OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 33% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 25.5%. The Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14.5%. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.46 on 157 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.39.\nSumming up on Q3 results and Q4 guidance. AI is growing across the economy, driving exceptionally strong semiconductor test demand in the second half of 2025. This is evident in our Q3 sales, profit performance and our outlook for Q4. The acceleration of test demand in Q4 reflects customers' drive to pull AI projects in from Q1. We're optimistic about the AI-related market 2026, but we also know shipments can be lumpy.\nNow to my final remarks. After 6-plus years at Teradyne, it's clear that Teradyne is well positioned for significant growth over the midterm. Many environmental challenges have occurred during my tenure such as significant government regulations, COVID, tariffs, CEO transition, along with the strategic pivot of investments to AI in 2022. Through all of these opportunities, we have strengthened the company's infrastructure and processes. Our operational resilience is significantly stronger as we have derisked our supply chain, started the journey of multiple factories and multiple geographies to enable significant growth rooted in AI, strong management leads our diversified portfolio enabled through our variable business model, which has consistently delivered tremendous free cash flow through all of the changes and volatility we've experienced. Our balance sheet is strong with firepower to enable strategic investments, continue to deliver a balanced capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders. I've had the opportunity to make [ New England ] my home and built many lasting relationships here internally and externally. I've enjoyed working with our shareholders and all of you in the investment community.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up the line for questions and soon hand the keys over to Michelle.

Our quiet period will begin at the close of business on September 19, 2025.\nFollowing Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory Stephen Smith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Traci. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.\nToday, I'll discuss our second quarter results and provide an update on what we're seeing across our businesses. Sanjay will then provide more detail on our second quarter results and third quarter guidance. Through the second quarter, end market trends noted in prior quarters were generally consistent with a strengthening second half. Strength in AI compute is more than offsetting lower demand in auto and industrial end markets. Pockets of improvement in mobile are driven more by customer-specific dynamics than an uptick in the end market demand. Visibility is starting to improve.\nIn terms of capacity utilization, we believe that we have turned the corner towards new -- more new system sales rather than selling upgrades of existing idle mobile capacity for new compute and mobile applications. Demand is strengthening in AI compute, and we are seeing a broadening of opportunities where Teradyne and especially the UltraFLEXplus is getting strong consideration in areas where we have not historically had a seat at the table. While new program and new test insertions can drive a lumpy order pattern, we are optimistic about the opportunities on our horizon. In the second half of 2025, we expect AI compute to be the dominant driver of our SoC business. The long-term themes with AI, verticalization and electrification remain intact with AI and verticalization emerging as the primary growth drivers in the near term.\nOur Q2 results reflect the evolving composition of our business. In the past, the typical seasonality in our revenue was heavily driven by consumer mobile demand. This has now been superseded by the waves of demand driven by specific customer program ramps in AI compute. These have [indiscernible] to consumer holiday buying patterns. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue, gross margins and earnings per share above the midpoint of ranges. Semi Test, specifically SOC for AI compute drove results above our expectations, and demand trends will persist, but we saw pockets of customer-specific strength in RF and mobile power in the quarter. In the industrial and automotive end markets, demand has stabilized at a low level. As expected in Q2, memory revenue was lower quarter-on-quarter due to the timing of shipments and is expected to snap back in the second half. In the quarter, our memory business unit secured an important HBM 4 post STACK singulated die win. HBM suppliers are adding test coverage to improve device quality some suppliers are adding a test insertion for HBM singulated stacks. And while this new insertion is not yet pervasive across the broader industry, we believe that it is an important growth driver for the memory TAM in the future. This win builds on momentum from the HBM4 post stack wafer test win in Q1 for our memory business unit.\nAs we discussed in our Analyst Day, there are 4 elements to growth in our IST business. Accelerated bit growth in HDD, share growth and recovery in the mobile SLT market, emerging SLT for high accelerators and solid-state disk drives. In Q2, IST revenue more than doubled compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by HDD and mobile. All of the businesses within our product test group delivered second quarter results generally in line with our expectations and up year-on-year. In the quarter, we closed the acquisition of quantify Photonics, accelerating an important element of our strategy to gain share in AI compute by establishing a leadership position in silicon photonics test.\nIn robotics, recall that we executed a structural reorganization that consolidated the customer-facing sales, marketing and service organizations of UR and MiR in the first quarter of 2025. In Q2, this [indiscernible] organization delivered 9% quarter-on-quarter growth despite persistent difficult market conditions, and we continue to optimize our OpEx envelope to respond. In the second quarter, as part of our pivot to large customers, we secured a plan of record decision from a large customer. This is not expected to have a material impact on robotics revenue in 2025, but is expected to be a significant growth driver later in 2026. In support of this opportunity and others, the team plans to open a manufacturing operation in the United States to best serve customers in this region.\nMoving on to Q3. As we progress through the third quarter, we are gaining confidence in AI compute related revenue inflecting in the second half of the year, driven by both SEC and memory. We are less certain of the quarterly timing of shipments between Q3 and Q4 and then between Q4 and Q1 due to customer schedules. That said, we expect the relative size of AI compute in our SOC and memory business to represent the majority of our Semi Test revenue in the second half. Our expectations for mobile are modest in the third quarter and the second half generally expecting that the bulk of the demand we see for the year has been satisfied in the first half.\nGrowth in the mobile segment is coupled to the ramp of 2-nanometer gate all around, and the expectation of more compelling AI applications in the generation of smartphones coming in the back half of 2026.\nIn the auto and industrial end markets, our end customers remain cautious about significant capacity adds, but we do not expect test equipment order patterns to deteriorate further. There are areas within this end market that are showing strength like the power semiconductors for data center build-outs, and we believe that the long-term trend towards electrification will drive growth beyond 2025. Overall, we feel good about where we're headed in the third quarter and the second half of the year. We are significantly more confident than we were 90 days ago. Demand trends in AI compute have strengthened and forecasts are materializing into orders. Utilization rates have improved considerably, leading to an increase in UltraFLEXplus system orders. With the work that we have done to increase the resilience of our supply chain and dual source our manufacturing, we are in a position to effectively scale volume with increased demand and provide timely delivery of our testers to fast-moving customers. I want to emphasize that we are opening these new opportunities because of the scalability of our newest systems, our capabilities in silicon photonics are parallelism and higher throughput that lowers the cost of test for our customers.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q2 and provide our Q3 outlook.\nNow to Q2 Second quarter sales were $652 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57, both above the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.3% consistent with our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $275 million, up year-over-year as we have increased our R&D investments and targeted opportunities to drive longer-term growth. OpEx came in flattish sequentially as we continue to practice disciplined spending controls. Non-GAAP operating profit was 15.1%.\nTurning to our revenue breakdown in Q2. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $492 million, with SOC revenue contributing $397 million. Memory, $61 million; and IST $34 million. Strength in SOC was driven by mobile upgrades. AI compute growth exceeded our plan. expected memory revenue was considerably lower sequentially and year-over-year due to the timing of customer deliveries, which is expected to be back half weighted this year. In the first half of this year, customers have been digesting the HBM test equipment delivered in 2024. We expect DRAM to dominate the memory mix in 2025, just as it did in 2024. IST revenue of $34 million was up both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by mobile SLT and HDD testers.\nIn product test, Q2 revenue was $85 million, up 7% year-over-year with all business units within product test up year-over-year. As Greg noted, we closed the acquisition of Quantify Photonics in the quarter as its results are included in this segment.\nNow to Robotics. Revenue was $75 million, up quarter-over-quarter but down year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $63 million and MiR contributed $12 million. While the long-term drivers of AI and onshoring and advanced robotics remain intact, near-term macro factors continue to be a headwind. Our second quarter operating results were better than our first quarter, and we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half. Despite this, due to the weak end market, we had lower volumes, yielding a lower gross margin. We expect the weak market to persist and do not expect robotics to break even this year.\nSome other financial information in Q2. We had 1 customer that directly or indirectly drove more than 10% of our revenue in the second quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. At a company level, our free cash flow was $132 million, primarily driven by improvements in net working capital in the quarter. We repurchased $117 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. In the first half, we returned $316 million or 138% of our free cash flow through dividends and buybacks to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $489 million in cash and marketable securities.\nNow turning to Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $710 million and $770 million. Third quarter gross margins are expected to be at 56.5% to 57.5%. Q3 OpEx is expected to run at 36.5% to 38.5% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 19.5%. The Q3 tax rate is expected to be 16.3% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase in rate is driven by the impact of the new tax legislation, which goes into effect in Q3. Hence, the year-to-date catch-up is included in Q3. A full year tax rate is expected to be 14.5%. Q3 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.69 to $0.87 on 158 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.80.\nIn terms of guidance, we will continue to guide 1 quarter at a time. Summing up, we delivered sales and earnings above the midpoint of our guide. We feel more confident in our near-term outlook than we did 90 days ago. Looking ahead, our visibility is improving, driven by demand in artificial intelligence in both SOC and memory. Second half of the year is shaping up to be stronger than the first half as we expected earlier in the year. Our multiyear investments in testing artificial intelligence are beginning to deliver new opportunities and accelerating top line growth. We are confident in the long-term growth drivers of AI, electrification and verticalization trends that will drive our business in the coming years.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line up for questions.

Following Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory Stephen Smith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Traci. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and provide an update on the trends that we are seeing across our businesses. Sanjay will then provide more detail on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance.\nIt's been 7 weeks since our Analyst Day and the long-term themes that we discussed, AI, verticalization and electrification remain the primary industry drivers that we expect will accelerate our growth trajectory in the years ahead. In the near term, the combination of trade policy and our customers' heightened uncertainty around end market demand has caused orders to push out as we discussed last month.\nAlthough the direct impact of current and anticipated 90-day tariffs on our model is minimal, we are more concerned about the impact of tariffs on the end market demand. Many of our customers, primarily in the mobile, automotive and industrial segments are reviewing their capital acquisition plans, and we do not have firm forecasts from them at this time.\nBeyond the second quarter, our visibility is very limited. As such, we are not commenting on or reaffirming our expectations beyond the second quarter.\nWe delivered first quarter revenue towards the high end of our guidance range with gross margin and earnings per share above the high end of our expectations. Strength in Semi Test, specifically SOC for the mobile end market, drove year-over-year growth. This mobile demand is transitory and related to some supply chain transitions at our customers rather than a signal of end market recovery.\nOur Compute revenue also grew year-over-year in Q1 with record loading on our UltraFLEX and UltraFLEXplus testers for AI accelerators Revenue in our product test and robotics test divisions were generally in line with our expectations in Q1.\nIn Semi Test, SOC delivered above our plan, and Memory was in line with our expectations as customers digest the HBM, or high bandwidth memory, capacity that was put in place last year. In the quarter, our Memory business unit secured a coveted HBM 4 performance test win with a major DRAM manufacturer, which is beginning to -- expected to begin shipping in the second half of this year.\nThis is our first DRAM wafer sort win at this customer and a major milestone for our Memory business. Our IST business, or integrated system test, delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations and achieved initial customer acceptance for the new Titan HP targeted at system level test of AI accelerators.\nWe are seeing new opportunities emerging in the IST space with both new and existing customers. All of the businesses in our newly formed product test division delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations. While the wireless test end market for our LitePoint business has been generally weak since 2023, the team has continued to secure the majority of opportunities in wireless networking sockets.\nIn the first quarter, LifePoint won 13 of 13 of the WiFi 7 wireless test opportunities. A critical aspect of our strategy to gain share in high-performance computing is to establish a leadership position in silicon photonics test. In support of that goal, we believe that we are on track to close the acquisition of Quantify Photonics in the second quarter.\nIn the first quarter, our Robotics division executed a structural reorganization, consolidating the customer-facing sales, marketing and service organizations between UR and MiR. Our robotics team has responded with resilience in what continues to be a very challenging macro backdrop.\nIn the quarter, Teradyne Robotics received the largest order in its history from a global automotive manufacturer for both MiR AMRs and UR cobot arms. The new pallet jack MiR 1200 is now in the hands of distributors and select lead customers and pilot installations are running.\nMoving on to Q2. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, we have seen customers push order delivery out from the second quarter into future quarters due to the uncertainty international trade policy could have on end market demand.\nDespite this, our view of Q2 remains in line with the expectations that we set in March. Given the lack of visibility and the impact that trade policy may have on the industry and our business, we are prudently managing expenses.\nWhile there are systematic OpEx savings that are delivered by our flexible business model and variable compensation strategy, we are also actively managing expenses with the objective of generating operating leverage. With our strong balance sheet, consistent free cash flow generation, low capital intensity and variable operating model, we are continuing critical investments and are positioning ourselves to drive growth as customers figure out their strategy in the current macro environment.\nWe see green shoots of evidence of this across Teradyne, as our business units address emerging opportunities and increasingly work across divisions to better solve customer problems.\nTAS, or Teradyne automated solutions, is a great example. Semiconductor customers are interested in automating particularly their back-end processes, which are still quite labor-intensive. In the first quarter, we announced the strategic partnership with ADI, which will deploy UR cobots and MiR AMRs to support ADI's collaborative automation initiative. The semiconductor market is one of the segments our robotics business is targeting to drive diversified growth.\nWithin Semi Test, IST is working hand-in-hand with our SOC team to help current and potential customers in the AI compute space cost-effectively optimized test insertion points. We are seeing this with our first Titan HP customer acceptance and revenue in Q1 from a hyperscaler customer.\nAnd in product test, our PBT, or production board test, business, which has historically been strongest in the automotive industry, is making gains in AI compute where technologies pioneered by Semi Test are being leveraged to help hyperscalers test server-level products. The increasing complexity and high cost of failure of these end products is creating sizable opportunities for us.\nIn the mobile space, after years of overcapacity, utilization rates have improved considerably, as evidenced by new system orders for AI compute complementing upgrades of underutilized mobile testers. We have started to see improvement in LPDDR for mobile applications, and we started shipping our next-generation image sensor testers for the mobile market in Q1 of 2025.\nWe are also winning new opportunities in SLT in the mobile market. With 2-nanometer and gate all around on the horizon, we are optimistic that as demand recovers, the setup for our mobile business is good. We cannot predict the impact that dynamic trade policies will have on global end demand, but we know that Teradyne has historically emerged stronger coming out of challenging macroeconomic periods. We expect that to be the case in 2025 as well.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1 and provide our Q2 outlook.\nNow to Q1. First quarter sales were $686 million, which was towards the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.75, above our high-end guide of $0.68. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.6%. This was above our guidance due primarily to product mix.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $275 million, up year-over-year as we have increased our investment and target opportunities to drive longer-term growth. That said, it's down sequentially as part of our implemented spending controls. Non-GAAP operating profit was 20.5%.\nTurning to our revenue breakdown in Q1. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SOC revenue contributing $406 million; Memory, $109 million; and IST, $27 million. Strength in SOC was driven primarily by mobile. As expected, Memory revenue was lower as customers digest the HBM test equipment delivered in 2024.\nWe expect DRAM to dominate the memory mix in 2025 just as it did in 2024. IST revenue was $27 million, was up both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by new SLT shipments for mobile and our first AI compute revenue.\nIn product test, Q1 revenue was $74 million, down 4% year-over-year, with wireless test revenue of $29 million up 20% year-over-year. This growth in wireless test was offset with weakness in production board test tied to the automotive industry and timing of programs in defense and aerospace.\nNow to robotics. Revenue was $69 million, declining both sequentially and year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $49 million and MiR contributed $20 million. While the long-term drivers of AI and onshoring and advanced robotics remain intact, near-term macro factors continue to be a headwind.\nIn robotics, the operating loss was $22 million, in line with our expectations. Given our restructuring, I'll share the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the loss. On a GAAP basis, our loss in Q1 was $37 million, including approximately $11 million in restructuring primarily associated with our go-to-market consolidation and $4 million of amortization of intangible assets.\nThis restructuring has reduced our operating breakeven revenue from $440 million to $365 million as described in January.\nI'd like to highlight our life-to-date Robotics GAAP results. Life to date, our GAAP losses are $231 million. Breaking that down, approximately $233 million of noncash amortization of intangibles, $45 million of restructuring costs resulting and $47 million of cumulative non-GAAP operating profit.\nSome other financial information in Q1. We had 1 customer that directly or indirectly drove more than 10% of our revenue in the first quarter. In Q1, 19% of our revenue was shipped to China, 12% in support of multinational customers and 7% in support of indigenous Chinese customers.\nFor context, in the past 2 years, shipments to indigenous -- to Chinese indigenous customers has been 5% of Teradyne's revenue. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nAt a company level, our free cash flow was $98 million, primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements in the quarter. We repurchased $157 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $622 million in cash and marketable securities.\nNow turning to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $610 million and $680 million. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 56.5% and 57.5%, a decrease quarter-over-quarter driven by product mix and lower volume.\nQ2 OpEx is expected to run at 40.5% to 44.5% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 14.5%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.64 on 161 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.58.\nMoving to the topic of tariffs. As Greg noted, the primary concern of the tariffs is the impact on the end market demand. As our manufacturing footprint and the location of our customers, we expect only a minimal impact on the efficiency of our business model. The impact of the tariff will generally be passed along to customers in affected regions.\nIn Q2, we expect to have a small increase of cost of sales and operating expenses, which amounts to approximately $0.02 of earnings for Q2, which is included in our guide. While we have assessed the financial impact due to tariffs in Q2, there is little ability to predict either the changes in tariff or trade policy or the magnitude of impact of the trade policy on end market demand.\nAs such, please do not rely on prior financial guidance that extend beyond the second quarter. That said, I'd like to provide additional color on the dynamics we're seeing in some of our markets.\nIn mobile, after 2 consecutive quarters of strength driven by some supply chain shifts, we expect our Q2 revenue for mobile to be lower. In Q2, we also expect a significant sequential decline in Memory revenue as the market continues to digest installed HBM test capacity.\nLooking out further. Freight policy, including tariffs, are most likely to impact mobile, automotive and industrial end markets. Significant changes to the AI diffusion rule or semiconductor trade restrictions may impact the compute market.\nTurning to share buybacks. As noted in our press release, we've increased our share buyback target from $400 million in 2025 to up to $1 billion through the end of 2026, reflecting our confidence in our long-term plans and free cash flow generation.\nSumming up, we delivered strong sales, earnings and free cash flow in the first quarter. Our expectations for the second quarter are largely in line with our expectations provided at our Analyst Day, inclusive of the expected impact of tariffs.\nWhile visibility remains limited and there is a heightened uncertainty on the end market demand, we are confident in the long-term drivers of AI, electrification and verticalization that will drive the industry and our businesses in the coming years.\nOur resilient variable business model and strong balance sheet enable us to continue to invest in areas of strategic importance as we await a broader end market recovery.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line up for questions.

This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Traci, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll start off by summarizing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and provide some context for our initial view of 2025. Then I'll provide context around our updated midterm earnings model. I'll describe the trends we expect to drive the market and Teradyne strategy to drive highly leveraged earnings growth through the midterm. Sanjay will then go into greater detail on all of these topics.\nOur fourth quarter came at the high end of our guidance range as trends we noted previously continued through the end of the year. Cloud AI has been the dominant driver of our semiconductor test business, and we have seen some short-term improvement in the mobile space, driven by supply chain shifts in our customer base. In industrial and automotive, our fourth quarter benefited from customer-specific equipment purchases. Strength in our test business more than offset the continuing weakness in the industrial automation market, which impacted our robotics business.\nIn 2024, after 2 years of semiconductor test market declines, our SOC and memory test revenue grew 17% year-over-year, excluding DIS. AI was the dominant driver of our growth, specifically AI accelerator ASICs, networking and HBM DRAM. We have previously described a class of customers called VIPs or vertically integrated producers. We use this term because these customers develop custom silicon to provide differentiation in their end products, whether they are phones, cars or cloud AI computing.\nIn the first half of 2024, we saw VIP strength for edge AI in automotive. In the second half, strength was driven by Cloud AI compute VIP customers. Our goal in 2024 was to achieve 50% market share in computing VIPs, and we believe that we achieved that goal. This is particularly notable because much of the VIP test demand in 2024 came in the form of upgrades to systems left underutilized by the weak mobile market. If this demand had come in the form of system sales, our 2024 VIP revenue would have been more than double what we recognized in the year.\nAt the company level, we grew 5% in 2024. If one excludes the divestiture of the DIS business, our total revenue growth was 8%, we grew earnings per share by 10% year-over-year and generated over $470 million in free cash flow. Our full year financial results reflect an inflection in our business, both in terms of semiconductor test cyclical recovery, but more importantly, a successful pivot to diversify our customer base and reduce customer concentration.\nIn 2020 and 2021 time frame, our business was dominated by mobile with high customer concentration in that market. Back then, we were highly exposed to mobile in SOC, memory and wireless test. Now in 2024, the compute end market was a larger component of our revenue than mobile as our SOC business in the compute market grew more than 3.5x the prior year. We have been investing to capitalize on the secular shift towards VIP ASICs, and that yielded roughly 50% share in what we believe was around a $300 million TAM in 2024. We have seen growth driven by our historical strength in the networking space. And we see opportunities in system-level test for AI compute. The pivot we have executed in SOC over the past couple of years is remarkable.\nIn 2023, 11% of our SOC product revenue was in computing and 51% was in auto and industrial. In 2024, 34% was in compute and 34% was in auto and industrial, a balance that underpins our longer-term model. Recent advancements in AI inference which appear to reduce the cost and time to develop AI applications may be a catalyst to accelerate edge AI development. We think this could directly benefit the markets where we have historical strength, mobile and automotive. It's early days, but we believe that lower cost, lower power and faster time-to-market AI solutions can drive complexity growth and increased unit demand at the edge, which are key inputs for improving demand for test equipment.\nLooking forward to 2025, we expect the SOC TAM to continue to grow roughly 7% year-over-year. While some of this growth is driven by AI compute, we expect a modest recovery in mobile, automotive and industrial in the back half of the year. We believe that we are positioned to gain share in the low single digits in SOC test.\nNow shifting gears to memory. In 2024, our memory business grew to over $500 million, up 30% year-over-year. Strength in the market and our growth was fueled by AI compute demand for HBM DRAM. In the second half of 2024, we were qualified for HBM performance test at a major memory supplier. Our higher throughput and forward compatibility created competitive differentiation, enabling us to capture significant share of the HBM performance test market in the second half of 2024.\nWe expect the HBM device end market to be strong through 2025. However, from a test equipment perspective, we are expecting the market to soften as customers absorb capacity with higher productivity tools. We expect the HBM TAM to recover in 2026. As a result, we expect the entire memory test market to be flattish in 2025, although we do expect to gain share in the low single-digit range.\nBeyond AI compute, we believe that there are other segments in the semiconductor test market that offer the opportunity for accelerating long-term growth. One of these areas is power semiconductors. These devices will continue to grow long term with the crossover to EVs and the demand for more efficient power generation, storage and distribution. We are announcing a strategic partnership with Infineon, the market leader in power semiconductors to acquire their internal tester development team in Regensburg, Germany. This group will enable us to accelerate our road map in power semiconductor space specifically in areas like silicon carbide and gallium nitride at the scale needed to serve the automotive and renewables market.\nWhile the Semi Test business was strong in 2024, Teradyne's other product test businesses, which include our System Test and Wireless Test operating segments continued to be impacted by weak end market conditions. Within our product test businesses, we saw some programs push out from 2024 into 2025, but scored key program wins that we expect to drive healthy growth in 2025. We expect our wireless test business to return to growth in 2025 after securing 74 out of 80 tracked WiFI 7 design win opportunities in 2024.\nTurning to robotics. The industrial automation market continued to be weak in Q4. We typically see strong fourth quarter seasonality as customers place quick turn orders in the back half of the quarter. Visibility is inherently low in this high turns business. In Q4 of 2024, this seasonality was far more muted than in prior years, and we ended the year down slightly for UR and roughly flat [ from ] year. This underperformed our expectations but outperformed our industrial automation peer group.\nDespite the headwinds, there were highlights for robotics. The UR channel transformation continues to progress with the OEM channel delivering 20% growth and the MiR large accounts also delivering 24% growth year-over-year in 2024. In the fourth quarter, as part of our multifaceted partnership with NVIDIA, UR launched its AI accelerator. Late in the fourth quarter, MiR's new flagship product that AI-enabled MiR1200 Pallet Jack began shipping to customers. And most recently, Teradyne Robotics announced a strategic partnership with Analog Devices to develop and deploy robots, AI and software to support ADI's automation initiative.\nIn 2024, a we combined UR and MiR operations into a unified robotics operations group. Now in Q1 of 2025, we are consolidating our go-to-market functions at the robotics level to enable our best partners to sell the full UR and MiR product line and to serve our customers better with a single customer service organization. This restructuring increases our efficiency and reduces our robotics breakeven revenue from $440 million in 2024 to $365 million in 2025.\nLooking ahead to the next 4 years, we are very optimistic. A year ago, there were questions as to whether VIPs would matter. And if they did, could we win their business. At that time, we thought the compute VIP market would be $100 million to $200 million opportunity in 2024, growing to $400 million to $600 million in the 2026 time frame. Our latest estimate is that the compute VIP market was $300 million in 2024 and the compute VIP market will be centered around $600 million in 2026 and could approach $800 million in 2028.\nWe believe that Cloud AI will continue to drive share gains for us in SOC and memory by the later years of this midterm as AI moves to the edge for mobile enabled by process technology like 2-nanometer and gate all around, we expect robust growth of the mobile TAM. With the remarkable complexity of AI computing systems and the need for highly reliable performance in the training and use of AI models, we expect growing demand for additional test steps. The addition of system-level test insertions for AI compute both in the cloud and at the edge creates an additional growth vector for Teradyne. This was a primary consideration in our decision to align the integrated system test unit within Semi Test.\nGoing forward, we believe that AI will have an outsized impact on the longer-term growth of edge devices, specifically in mobile and automotive applications. Also the trends towards electrification, whether pure EV or hybrid provide considerable growth potential with increasing silicon content per vehicle. Our investments in this space, including our strategic partnership with Infineon will help us drive share gains in this highly complex test intensive segment of the market.\nBased on these long-term trends, we expect to see healthy TAM growth in the automotive and mobile segments of the market over the midterm. Our strong market position in these segments will help fuel our revenue growth. These positive trends underpin our 2028 earnings model. At the midpoint of our model, we expect to grow from $2.8 billion of revenue in 2024 to $5 billion in 2028. We expect EPS to grow from $3.22 per share to $8.25 per share over the same period, implying a 12% to 18% revenue CAGR and a 21% to 31% EPS CAGR over that period, demonstrating considerable operating leverage in our business model.\nTo sum up, 2024 was a very good year. We have repositioned the company and are seeing the success from our investments in AI, in compute and in memory. We expect that 2025 will be another good year. We are setting our Robotics business up on a sustainable path for long-term growth, and our test business will grow, driven by continued strength in share gains in VIPs, tightening capacity utilization and the return of higher demand in mobile, industrial and automotive.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our Q4 and full year 2024 financial summary. We will provide our Q1 outlook, some planning guidance for the full year 2025 and discuss our updated earnings model and capital allocation plan. Now to Q4. Fourth quarter sales were $753 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.95, both at the high end of our guidance range.\nSemi Test revenue, which now includes our Integrated System Test business, or IST, comprised of product lines for system-level test and HDD test was $561 million. Within Semi Test, SOC revenue was $429 million with memory shipments of $112 million and IST shipments, $19 million. The other product test businesses comprised of defense and aerospace, production board test and wireless task contributed $94 million. Robotics revenue was $98 million, was up 11% sequentially with muted seasonality due to ongoing weak industrial spending. As Greg noted, we had softer-than-expected performance in the Robotics business tied to typical turns business that did not materialize.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 59.4%, just below our guidance range due to robotics. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $284 million in Q4, higher than our guide. A majority of the increase was tied to accelerated engineering spend in SemiTest. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 22%. Some other financial facts. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 7.6% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of product mix shift to Semi Test. [ GAAP ] tax rate was 8.7% in Q4, excluding discrete items. We repurchased $144 million of shares in the quarter as we opportunistically accelerated our share buybacks. Dividends were $19 million, and we had 1 10% customer in the quarter.\nTurning to the full year results. Our revenue was [ $2.8 billion ]. Samsung was the only customer greater than 10% of our revenue for the year. Gross margin for the year was 58.6%. OpEx was $1.08 billion and operating profit was 20.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.22. We generated $474 million in free cash flow in 2024. We returned $275 million or 58% of free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We ended the year with $724 million of cash and marketable securities.\nOur tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 12.6% on a non-GAAP basis and 12.5% on a GAAP basis. Business unit revenues for 2024 were as follows: Semi Test revenue for the year, including IST, was $2.124 billion with SOC revenue contributing $1.537 billion, memory, $502 million and IST, $85 million. Excluding the impact of our DIS divestiture, our SOC and memory revenue was 17% year-over-year. SOC growth in the year was driven by AI compute, specifically custom ASICs for VIPs and networking.\nOur memory sales were up 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI compute demand for HBM DRAM. IT revenue declined 39% year-over-year, primarily due to underutilized test capacity in HDD. Turning to our other product test businesses. the System Test group, which is combined defense and aerospace and Production Board Test had revenue of $201 million in 2024, flattish in 2023. Wireless Test revenue was $130 million, down from 2023 due to slower ramp of WiFI 7. The combined revenue of the 2 operating segments in 2024 was $331 million, down 4% year-over-year.\nNow to robotics. Robotics revenue in 2024 was $365 million, with UR contributing $293 million near $72 million. Considerably lower than expected volumes in the fourth quarter drove profitability well below our expectations, the group had 13% non-GAAP operating loss in both Q4 and the full year. As Greg mentioned, we are restructuring the robotics business to create a single point of contact for customers and partners across UR and MiR sales, marketing and service organizations to improve customer experience. The result of these actions will help drive top line growth in 2025 and improve our efficiency. These actions will enable our robotics business to continue to outperform industrial automation market.\nNow to our outlook for Q1. Since our October call, our Semi Test outlook has remained strong. However, robotics forecast remains seasonably soft. Q1 sales are expected to be between $660 and $700 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.58 to $0.68 on 163 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges. First quarter gross margins are expected to be in the range of 58.5% to 59.5%. OpEx is expected to be roughly flat with Q4 and run at approximately 41.5% to 42.5% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 17%.\nAs Greg noted, we believe the semiconductor SOC test TAM will see healthy growth in 2025. And driven by a second half broad-based recovery. We expect the SOC TAM to be between $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion or $4.9 billion at the midpoint. For a more detailed view of our end market expectations for SOC, please refer to the table in our earnings deck. We are forecasting the memory TAM to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Recall that within this, HBM has grown from around $100 million in 2023 to over $500 million in 2024. Our memory TAM forecast for 2025 is roughly flat year-over-year with the HBM tester market going through a period of digestion.\nIn both the SOC and memory Semi Test markets, we expect to gain low-digit share in 2025. In robotics, we are currently operating in a difficult low visibility industrial spending environment. The business is still driven by terms. When we look at our plans for 2025 we see SAM expansion and channel growth initiatives expected to yield approximately 10% revenue growth in current market conditions. Of course, there is a wide range around this growth expectation.\nFew points to assist you in the modeling 2025 for the enterprise. In Q2, we expect 5% to 10% sequential growth from Q1's midpoint. We expect first half revenue to be approximately 43% to 44% of full year revenue. Now to gross margins. We expect full year gross margins to be 59% to 60%. We expect second half gross margins to slightly improve from current levels tied to higher revenue expected in the second half of the year.\nRegarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2025 OpEx to increase 8% to 10% year-over-year, which is a reduction from our low teens view in October. The key changes were restructuring to capture synergies between UR and MiR and robotics and the acceleration of Semi Test projects in Q4. Interest and other line is forecasted at $1 million of income per quarter while we have cash driving the yield. We also have items like FX gains and losses included in this line in our P&L. Our GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 15.25% and 15% non-GAAP in 2025, excluding discrete items.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent as we take a balanced approach to maintain cash reserves that enable us to run the business and have dry powder for M&A. For reference, from 2015 to 2024, we've returned over $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. which is 93% of free cash flow. 2025, we plan on executing up to $400 million of share buybacks along with our current level of dividends.\nMoving to our midterm earnings model. As we do each January, we've updated our model. We share this model with investors to provide insight into how we look at the markets we serve, our competitive positioning and ultimately, the growth and earnings power of the company. A few points for context. We're rolling forward our midterm model to 2028, which replaces our prior 2026 midterm model. That said, we believe we are tracking with our prior 2026 model in terms of ranges of revenue and earnings.\nOver the midterm, we expect test revenue to grow at a 12% to 17% CAGR off of our 2024 results driven by continued strength in AI compute related demand and recovery with long-term growth in broader end markets, including auto, industrial and mobile. Our mobile assumption is for recovery, but we're not assuming a return to the prior peak 2021. In robotics, we're expecting the industrial markets to begin to recover with AI expanding the SAM and persistent labor shortages. We expect these dynamics to drive a top line of 18% to 24% CAGR off of 2024 with modest growth in 2025, which we expect to accelerate over the midterm.\nGoing forward, the robotics operating model will deliver increasing operating leverage through the midterm, ending towards the high end of our target 5% to 15% operating profit range for this business. Our updated midterm model is expected to drive 2028 revenue to $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS between $7 and $9.50. As Greg mentioned, this implies a 15% CAGR from 2024 to 2028, and a 27% EPS CAGR at the midpoint, demonstrating the operating leverage of our test and robotics businesses.\nGross margin is expected to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx as a percentage of sales between 28% to 31%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 32%, coming up 2024 was a good year overall, driven by strength in Semi Test. Excluding the DIS divestiture, our overall company revenues grew 8% year-over-year, and our SOC and memory combined grew 17% year-over-year, helping to achieve a 10% increase in our EPS to $3.22. We are making strategic investments to drive competitive advantage in the Semi Test business, and we are leveraging logical synergies between UR and MiR, to drive long-term sustainable growth in robotics. We enter 2025 feeling good about the year and our line of sight to our midterm model.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator?"

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for the second quarter of 2024 and our outlook for the third quarter of 2024. The press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening.\nWe are providing slides as well as a copy of this earnings script on the Investor page of the Teradyne website that may be helpful in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.\nThe matters we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We caution listeners not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this presentation. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the slides accompanying this presentation as well as the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\nAdditionally, these forward-looking statements are made only as of today. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, were available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology and industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Evercore, Jefferies, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nFollowing Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Traci. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will summarize our second quarter results and discuss the trends we are seeing in the semiconductor and advanced robotics industries. Then Sanjay, will go into more more depth about our second quarter results and forward-looking guidance.\nAt a high level, the market dynamics that we identified in our April earnings call have continued through the second quarter. Cloud AI is driving strong demand across the SOC and memory test markets. We have accelerated engineering and sales investments to continue to improve our market position, drive share and increase our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Outside of Compute and Memory, all other major test markets, including mobile, continue to be soft. Robotics has delivered on plan results in a weak macro environment and we continue to expect incremental growth each quarter of this year.\nFocusing in on Q2, we delivered second quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SOC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter, primarily driven by AI applications. Continuing the trend we noted in the first quarter, cloud AI demand drove Compute revenue with considerable strength in networking devices. AI-enabled data centers have a very high number of network connection points to sustain -- to support training large language models, which is changing the mix in this segment to include more networking silicon. Our historic strength in networking combined with shipments to support a vertically integrated producer, or VIP, resulted in Compute revenue in the first half of 2024, exceeding all of our Compute revenue in 2023.\nWe currently expect that Teradyne's SOC revenue from the Compute end market will be on par with Mobile revenue this year. In Memory, AI-driven HBM DRAM demand remains strong. We are now seeing AI-driven servers pulling demand across a broader range of memory, including enterprise SSD NAND flash. We are also seeing memory demand for the mobile market with strength in LPDDR and continuing retooling to support the latest protocol-based mobile flash memory technologies. As for the result, our Memory business has grown nearly 30% in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023. While we are not changing our estimated Memory TAM expectation for the year, we expect that the market is trending towards the upper end of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion forecast. Moving on to Q3.\nThe positive impact of AI on Test is expected to continue into the third quarter. However, a meaningful uptick in other end markets, including legacy auto and industrial, may not occur until the 2025 time frame. As a result, at the company level for the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit revenue growth from 2023. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the sale of DIS to Technoprobe, our 2024 revenue growth would have been a couple of percentage points higher. Now turning to Robotics.\nDespite a weak macro environment, our Advanced Robotics business grew sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Looking at the first half of 2024, we grew 11% compared to the first half of 2023. We estimate that traditional players in the automation space have seen sales actually decline in the range of 5% to 7% over the same period. We are executing a 3-pronged growth strategy for our Advanced Robotics business. SAM expansion, channel transformation and recurring services and software. In the second quarter, we have made progress in all three areas. First, SAM expansion; our new high-payload cobots, the UR20 and UR30 began shipping late last year. In Q2 of 2024, these products represented over 20% of UR sales. The new AI-powered MiR1200 Pallet Jack was announced in the first quarter and will begin shipments in Q4 of this year. This product includes a market-leading pallet detection solution developed in collaboration with NVIDIA and has been well received by target manufacturing and logistics customers, resulting in significant backlog for Q4 shipment. Our highest priority in our robotics go-to-market transformation is the development of an OEM solutions channel for UR. We have seen that customers purchasing cobot based solutions from these partners get into production more quickly and have fewer problems than customers that build their own solutions or rely upon an integration partner. There are two aspects to the OEM channel strategy. The first is signing up new OEM solution partners. In the first half of 2024, we have increased the total number of OEM solutions partners by 8%. Second, we work with these partners to get them to scale, which we define as having an annual revenue run rate above $1 million. Midway through the year, we have nearly as many OEM solution partners that have reached that revenue level as we had in all of 2023.\nOne of our largest revenue OEM partners in the first half of 2024, uses our cobots in an AI-based logistics solution. Overall, the OEM solutions channel has shown over 70% growth from the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024. In the second quarter, the OEM channel represented over 30% of UR's revenue. Finally, because of the criticality of the processes that our robotics are being used to automate, we saw an opportunity to build a strong service business. In the first half of 2024, we launched Managed Service offerings at UR and MiR, and are beginning to see customer uptake. On balance, the positive effect of these growth vectors and the challenging demand environment, we are expecting growth towards the low end of this year's target 10% to 20% range.\nLast quarter, I shared the idea that AI would be a transformational secular growth driver across Teradyne's businesses. In the first half of 2024, we saw the considerable AI-driven growth in memory, networking and ramps of vertically integrated producers. But we think that this is just the beginning. We believe that a larger opportunity lies ahead as inference applications and edge AI begins to permeate the mobile and industrial end markets. Markets where Teradyne is traditionally strong. We are also already seeing the impact of AI on our Robotics business with AI-powered OEM solutions for UR and a strong backlog for our AI-enabled Pallet Jack. We believe that we are well positioned as a leading platform for the development of AI-based solutions for manufacturing and logistics. We are seeing AI-driven growth now and we expect AI to be an overarching growth driver for years to come in Test and in Robotics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q2 provide our Q3 outlook and planning assumptions for the full year. Now to Q2, second quarter sales were $730 million, which was $5 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, which was above our high-end guide of $0.84. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.3%. This was above our guidance due to higher volumes and product mix. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 22%. Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q2.\nSemi Test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SOC contributing $414 million and Memory $129 million. Strength in SOC was driven by both Compute and Mobile. Memory Test shipments were driven by technology tooling for new UFS 4.0 standard in mobility. While the broader auto industry remains sluggish, we benefited from a VIP with a large purchase in this segment, reflecting edge AI's impact on the auto market.\nIn Memory, we continue to expect DRAM to dominate the memory mix. We have significant backlog for HBM, enabling strength in the memory market, driven by AI. We closed the sale of our Device Interface Solutions business or DIS to Technoprobe on May 27. DIS contributed $16 million to our revenue in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. In System Test group, Q2 revenue was $61 million with $17 million in storage tests on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market. And even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester utilization remains low.\nIn Wireless Test, revenue was $36 million in Q2, improving as expected, due to gaming and the initial ramp of WiFi 7. Now to Robotics. For the fourth quarter in a row, we executed to our revenue plan in Robotics. Revenue was $90 million, up sequentially and increased 26% year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $75 million and MiR contributed $16 million. Given the potential changes in the regulatory environment involved in China, we thought it would be helpful to provide some insight into our revenue exposure in that region. Year-to-date, approximately 10% of our total company sales were shipped to China. This includes shipments to indigenous and multinational customers. Total sales to indigenous customers was less than 5% in the first half of 2024. This is consistent with the full year of 2023. Our team continues to service our customers in this market while complying with all regulations. Shifting to some cash metrics.\nAt a company level, our free cash flow was $171 million in the quarter. Strong free cash flow in the quarter was primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements. We repurchased $8 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $584 million in cash and marketable securities. The completion of the Technoprobe transactions resulted in a net cash outlay of $434 million and resulted in a 10% equity stake in Technoprobe. Some other financial information in Q2. We had 2, 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 14.25% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. Now to our outlook for Q3.\nQ3 sales are expected to be between $680 million and $740 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.82. Some color on our Q3 revenue expectation. In our April call, our mid guide for Q2 was $695 million. And we noted that the third quarter would be flattish. Our second quarter revenue came in higher than we forecasted on the heels of strong demand in our System Test business. Our third quarter revenue forecast of $710 million at the midpoint is now higher than it was 90 days ago. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% to 59.5%, and OpEx is expected to run at 38% to 40% of third quarter sales, up from Q2. As Greg discussed, we are acting on opportunities to accelerate investments that we believe will drive share and long-term sustainable growth. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. Our total semiconductor ATE TAM estimates remain unchanged from our view in April. However, we made some slight adjustments within the segments. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings deck with this information.\nRecall, our SOC TAM range is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion with a midpoint of $3.9 billion. This is comprised of Compute, which we now estimate to be $1.6 billion, up $100 million from our prior estimate. The increase in Compute is offset by a reduction in our estimate for Mobile, which is down $100 million to $800 million. We estimate Auto MCU at $500 million, Industrial at $300 million and Services at $700 million each at the midpoint of our range. Our estimated Memory TAM range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion appears to be tracking towards the high end. Back to revenue. With our outperformance in the first half of the year, our expectation for revenue distribution and for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in April. We currently expect around 48% of the company's revenue to be in the first half and 52% in the second half.\nWe expect full year revenue to grow in the low single-digit range compared to 2023. Note that excluding the impact of the DIS divestiture, our full year revenue growth expectation would be nearly 3 points higher. Now to gross margins. Gross margins have improved through the course of the year and are expected to be at our full target gross margin model by the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range unchanged from our prior outlook. Regarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow approximately 8% which is above our prior guidance of 5% to 7% as we accelerate investment and opportunities to continue to strengthen our position and gain share. Turning to Robotics profitability. As Greg noted, we expect to grow revenue towards the low end of our 10% to 20% range. We expect Robotics will be roughly breakeven in 2024. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 14.25% and 15%, respectively, in 2024. With regard to capital allocation, we will continue to target our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to $800 million.\nSumming up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as Memory and Compute revenue exceeded our plan in Semi Test. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remain soft. Our Robotics team delivered sequential and year-over-year growth as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Our company's first half performance gives us confidence that we are on track for the year. Our midterm fundamentals remain strong, and we are investing to capture the opportunities beyond 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line up for questions. Operator?"

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Tsuchiguchi. You may begin.\n\nTraci Tsuchiguchi\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for the first quarter of 2024 and our outlook for the second quarter of 2024.\nThe press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening.

This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Traci. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our first quarter results and discuss some of the trends in the semiconductor industry and robotics that we believe position Teradyne for long-term growth. It is useful to comprehend these longer-term growth drivers because the industries in which we operate are inherently cyclical. Sanjay will then provide greater financial detail on our first quarter results, our current outlook and additional financial information. .\nWe delivered first quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SoC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter driven primarily by AI applications. The impact of AI on our business was seen in networking as well as in Edge AI applications like ADAS. Over 40% of our memory shipments in the first quarter were driven by AI applications.\nAs we expected, mobile continued to be soft in the first quarter. Our robotics business delivered to planned for the third consecutive quarter as their go-to-market execution continues to improve.\nMoving on to Q2. The impact of AI on test demand we experienced in the first quarter is continuing into the second quarter, improving our outlook in memory and in compute. However, a meaningful upturn in mobile, legacy auto and industrial end markets may not occur until the 2025 time frame.\nLooking ahead, within the semiconductor test market, we expect that the compute TAM, which includes networking in many vertically integrated producers to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. We now estimate the compute TAM in 2024 to be $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion. We have lowered our TAM estimates for auto, industrial and mobile markets as recovery in these end markets appears to be pushing out in time. With the combination of our stronger first half and limited visibility into the second half, our estimate of the 2024 SOC TAM remains unchanged at $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.\nIn memory test, we are increasing our expectation TAM growth to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from our prior estimate of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, driven mainly by stronger demand for HBM, which we expect to grow 5x last year's level. As I'm sure you've noticed, our first quarter results and second quarter expectations are significantly above our view from January. For the full year, at the company level, we continue to expect low single-digit growth from 2023. In January, we are expecting the year to be back half loaded with mobile driving that recovery. We also shared that lead times were decreasing and our visibility was limited. The sustained strength and new demand in AI-driven applications are boosting our business in the first half. However, we are being cautious on the second half on what looks like continued weakness in the mobile market. Our operations team is continuing to enable us to pursue short lead time opportunities, so it certainly feels as if there's more upside opportunity than downside risk.\nNow turning to robotics. The first quarter is typically quite weak for our robotics business, and this year is no exception. We were very pleased to see the team deliver on plan and are expecting sequential growth in the second quarter. We are executing a plan which we expect to deliver 10% to 20% growth in 2024. This plan includes 3 elements: first is SAM expansion through new offerings. Second is growing our OEM solution provider in large account channels. Third is building increased recurring revenue through service and software offerings.\nIn the first quarter, we made good progress in all of these areas. We executed on new SAM expanding initiatives with the announcement of UR's collaboration with NVIDIA and the new MiR1200 pallet jack. We grew our UR OEM business 58% year-on-year, and we received the single largest order in the history of MiR from a strategic customer.\nZooming out, we see AI as the transformational secular growth driver across all of our businesses. AI applications are already having a profound impact on the test market, but we are in the very early days of the growth trend that will play out over the coming years. Today, the profit pool generated from AI is concentrated in the build-out of cloud AI capabilities, especially for training LLM on huge data sets. The hardware requirements for training are massive and include general purpose fine grain compute, high bandwidth memory, dense network interconnection, and mammoth amounts of power, all of which are driving our business today. However, these LLMs will only deliver a business impact when they're used to solve problems in the real world. In other words, through inference applications, both in the cloud and at the edge. This is the key opportunity that is driving vertically integrated producers to develop their own devices and will materially affect the complexity of edge processors in automotive, industrial and mobile applications.\nWhile our business is benefiting today from the considerable AI-driven growth in memory, networking and a few early ramps of vertically integrated producers, our greatest opportunity lies ahead as inference applications and edge AI accelerates because of our strong position with many of the leading providers of mobile and in bin computing in industrial and ADAS applications.\nAI will also have a profound impact on the robotics industry. Teradyne Robotics is focused on collaborative applications, where robots need to work safely and efficiently in complex environments. AI provides an opportunity to more easily deploy robots that understand and adapt to their surroundings, making them more resilient and expanding the range of problems that they can address. With our layered approach to safety, high product quality and an open platform ecosystem, UR and MiR, are positioned as the preferred robotics platforms for the development of AI manufacturing and logistics solutions.\nLast month, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to utilize their robotic stack on UR hardware and demonstrated the power of that collaboration at GTC with a visual inspection application. Also in the first quarter, we announced the MiR1200 pallet jack, a new AI-powered solution that uses 3D Vision to identify, pick up and deliver pallets even in dynamic and complex environments, making it a valuable resource for autonomous material handling in factories and warehouses.\nAdvanced robotics is just 1 of the many early examples of Edge AI applications positively impacting our business. Others include advanced driver assistance systems and AI capabilities being added to premium tier mobile handsets. NGI is becoming a material driver of TAM growth for Semi Test, but we're in very early days. We expect AI will be an overarching growth driver for years to come in test as a primary demand driver and in robotics as a key enabler of market growth. We're positioned to benefit from this megatrend, and we're investing R&D and field resources to capture this opportunity.\nSumming up the quarter, we're off to a strong start with Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 well ahead of our view just 3 months ago. The strength and test is focused on cloud and edge AI applications, while other parts of the semiconductor industry work through inventory. Calling the end of these corrections is a challenge. So we're being cautious about our second half outlook. That said, our flexible operations model will enable us to serve upside demand. We expect that industrial, automotive and mobile will rebound from their current low levels and entirely new demand drivers like AI are already contributing to our Test business. The industry increase in WFE spend in 2024 and 2025 will drive unit volume and device complexity growth, reinforcing our confidence in our midterm outlook.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and full year planning assumptions. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $600 million, which was $10 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, which was above the high end of our guidance of $0.38. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, above our guidance due to favorable product mix, higher volumes and improved operational efficiencies. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, both flat year-over-year and up slightly compared to our fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 15%. .\nTurning to our revenue breakdown in Q1. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $412 million, with SoC revenue contributing $302 million and memory $110 million. In memory, our sales were strongest in DRAM as AI-driven demand remains strong. Test for HBM is being prioritized by our customers, and we are seeing customers transition capital spending for testers away from flash to DRAM, in part due to HBM and the return of capacity adds and other DRAM test.\nHistorically, we've seen split between flash and DRAM markets be more balanced. In System Test group, Q1 revenue was $75 million, with $23 million in storage test on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market. And even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester capacity utilization rates remain low. In Wireless Test, revenue was $25 million in Q1, reflecting continued weakness in PC and mobile markets. In Q2, we expect wireless test to improve due to gaming end market and are now beginning to see the ramp of WiFi 7.\nNow to robotics. Revenue was $88 million as planned with UR contributing $68 million and MiR $20 million. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $37 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay taxes and variable employee compensation. We repurchased $22 million of shares in the quarter and paid $18 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $871 million in cash and marketable securities.\nSome other financial information in Q1. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the fourth quarter was 15% on a GAAP basis and 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In Q1, we incurred an FX loss on the fair value of the currency exchange hedge related to the expected investment in Technoprobe. This drove a larger than typical variance between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the quarter.\nTurning to our current operational environment. In Semi Test, supply lead times continue to decline as supply versus demand is more in line. Our lead times continue to hold at 1 to 2 quarters. However, in some cases, we have been able to service demand inside these lead times. As a result, our customers are moving back towards historical buying patterns with shorter lead times, thus yielding lower second half 2024 visibility consistent with the pre-pandemic environment. Robotics remains a quick turns business and our execution continues to deliver to these market conditions.\nNow turning to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $665 million and $725 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.64 to $0.84 and 162 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the anticipated gain on the expected sale of DIS, which is $0.29 in our GAAP forecast.\nSome color around the forecasted increased Q2 revenue versus our January view. The increase is driven by our Semi Test business where ADAS, compute networking and HBM demand has strengthened. As noted, this AI strength has continued into the second quarter and some orders initially scheduled for shipment in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter, improving our near-term outlook. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 36% to 39% of second quarter sales, up modestly from Q1. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 20%.\nA few points to assist you in modeling the rest of the year. I'll start with a few more details about the market estimates Greg provided. While our view of the SOC TAM is unchanged in total, under the cover, there are some puts and takes. Compute is up approximately $100 million, while mobile, auto and industrial are down a little over $100 million in aggregate. In anticipation of questions, let me provide the midpoint of our estimates by segment. Compute, $1.5 billion; mobile 0.9 billion; auto MCU, $0.5 billion; Industrial, $0.3 billion; and service, $0.7 billion, summing up to $3.9 billion for SoC.\nYou'll notice the aggregate decline change has been allocated to the Industrial segment. Our memory estimate has increased $200 million with the midpoint of $1.25 billion. Please note, our final estimate for the 2023 SOC TAM is $4 billion, up $100 million in the compute segment from our January view.\nBack to revenue. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve from there. Note that our flattish sequential growth in Q3 does not assume any revenue from DIS. Excluding the impact of the anticipated divestiture, we would expect revenue to grow sequentially in Q3. Our expectation for revenue distribution for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in January. We currently expect around 47% of the company revenue to be in the first half and 53% in the second half. We expect full year revenue to grow in the low single-digit range compared to 2023.\nNow to gross margins. Gross margins are expected to continue to improve as we progress through the year and should be at our target gross margin model for the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range unchanged from our January outlook.\nRegarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow 5% to 7%, consistent with prior guide as we continue to make engineering and go-to-market investments. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 15% to 15.5%, respectively, in 2024.\nA quick update on our previously announced strategic partnership with Technoprobe. As a reminder, the agreement has several key components. First, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne's DIS business, which provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers' chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of the company. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems. We continue to expect the transactions to close in the second quarter.\nDIS revenue contribution for the first quarter was approximately $21 million. Post closing, our cash position will decline as the transaction is expected to consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will continue to limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back to a minimum goal of $800 million.\nSumming up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as memory and networking exceeded our plan in Semi Test, mainly driven by AI. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remain soft. Our robotics team delivered to plan for the third consecutive quarter, as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Overall, visibility beyond the second quarter is limited, given the increased level of turns business in Semi Test. Our first quarter performance and the improvement in our second quarter outlook elevates our confidence for the year. Midterm fundamentals remain intact, yielding continued optimism beyond 2024.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Traci. Traci?"

Welcome to Teradyne's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Andy Blanchard, Vice President, Corporate Communications. Mr. Blanchard, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2023's fourth quarter and full year, along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2024.\nThe Press Release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening. We are providing slides on the Investor page of the website, that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings.\nAnd additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, where available on the Investor page of our website.\nLooking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in Technology or Industrial-focused Investor Conferences hosted by Wolfe Research, Citi, Susquehanna and Morgan Stanley. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the first quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory Smith\n\nHello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, comment on our early view of 2024 and describe the market assumptions underpinning our updated midterm earnings model. Sanjay will then provide financial details on all of these topics.\nWe delivered Q4 financial results in line with our guidance. The clear highlights for the quarter were the -- were Memory Test, where DRAM tester revenue more than doubled from Q4 2022 on HBM demand and our Robotics team's execution in growing sales, 17% from Q4 2022 and 50% sequentially, as we ramped shipments to address the record backlog of our new UR20 Cobot at Universal Robots. Balancing these strengths in Memory and Robotics was continued softness in our other test markets.\nShifting now to the full year, 2023 was the second consecutive year that the size of the semiconductor test market declined, as the industry digested record shipments in 2020 and 2021, driven by COVID-related demand. The SOC test market has declined 21% from 2021 and the Mobility portion has contracted 55% over the same period. Most of that decline occurred in 2023, with SOC demand down 17% year-on-year. Mobility has historically been the largest subsegment of the SOC market and an area of strength for us in semiconductor test and in wireless test.\nDespite the weakness in demand, the trend towards vertically integrated producers is continuing. This new class of customer provides an opportunity for Teradyne to gain share in high-performance computing, a segment where we have historically had low share. These customers will take time to ramp. And so we are focusing on capturing sockets.\nOn that front, 2023 was a great year for us, capturing the majority of key VIP sockets, where we targeted at customers in the United States and in China. Although automotive was strong for most of 2023, at the end of the year, elevated inventories for our automotive customers began to slow down the rate at which they add test capacity. Our latest estimate of the Semi Test market for 2023 is about $4.8 billion, with $3.9 billion in SOC and $900 million in Memory test.\nOur 2023 financial results reflected the test market weakness and when combined with a tepid Robotics marketing -- market, company sales were $2.676 billion, down about 15% and non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 were down 31% from 2022. As we enter 2024, let me describe how we're looking at the current market. Visibility is limited, but we are cautiously optimistic. In SOC test, chip inventories remain high and subcon tester utilization remains in the 70s. These combined to create a headwind to tester demand in the first half of 2024.\nThe inventory overhang now extends to parts of the legacy Automotive market, which began to soften late in Q4. With this softening of demand, lead times for our SOC testers are now back to pre-COVID levels, generally less than 16 weeks. This enables customers to wait to place new orders until their demand is certain, limiting our visibility. Our current view is that these headwinds will abate midyear, and we are planning for a second -- a stronger second half in SOC test. Several leading indicators point to a second half improvement. For example, we've seen no slowdown in chip development activity at our customers, so the product pipeline remains healthy.\nWhile still below normal seasonality, utilization levels are beginning to inch upwards, especially in the OSATs, which points towards improving mobility and compute demand. Mobile phones are expected to adopt AI capabilities in the premium tier in 2024 and more broadly in 2025, which should accelerate complexity and be a positive for test demand.\nDespite the slowdown we are seeing now in Automotive demand, the key driver for this market is the increased electronics content per vehicle, not end vehicle sales. Automotive semi devices are forecast to grow an 11% CAGR through the midterm, and this device -- this and the vast complexity is increasing. Therefore, we expect this law will be short-lived. In Memory Test, the story for 2023 is that despite high end market inventories, demand for new testers was driven by the retooling required to test higher speed flash and DRAM devices, especially HBM DRAM. This drove our Memory share to a record 43% in 2023.\nIn 2024, we expect continued Memory revenue growth driven by the volume production ramps of the technology introductions we saw in 2023 and continued R&D investments for even faster devices. As business conditions improve for Memory makers, this may drive increased demand to support capacity expansion. Shifting now to other test markets. Wireless test demand is expected to remain at current levels in 2024, due to weakness in the networking equipment demand and excess capacity in smartphone test. In System Test, we expect continued strength in Defense and Aerospace markets and expect modest growth in demand and Production Board test, we expect Storage Test will remain weak in 2024, due to excess test capacity in the HDD and SLT test markets.\nHaving said that, in 2023, we added important new SLT customers in mobility and high-performance computing that are setting us up for midterm growth. Shifting to Robotics. We had a very strong Q4 as our UR20 ramp continued, and we launched the new UR30 late in the quarter. Looking at Robotics for the full year 2023. In addition to the good progress on the product front, our channel transformation work continued nicely with our OEM sales growing nearly 10%, as we added more than 50 new OEM partners.\nWe've also expanded the number of large accounts we manage directly from approximately 100 to over 250. We expect Q1 of 2024 to be down more than the normal seasonal dip, as the extraordinary Q4 shipments are digested. Thereafter, we expect quarterly year-on-year growth through the rest of 2024. Combining all these points and with the proviso that our view into the second half is limited, we're modeling 2024 company revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year with 44% in the first half and 56% in the second half.\nWithin that, we expect lower Test revenue in 2024, which reflects the sale of our DIS business, reducing our full year Semiconductor Test revenue by approximately $100 million. Excluding the effects of that sale, expected Test revenue would have been about flat in a roughly flat market. In Semi Test, our early estimate of the SOC market size for 2024 is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion. And our estimate for Memory is $1 billion to $1.1 billion, for a combined Semiconductor Test market at the midpoint of $4.95 billion. We expect Robotics will grow in the 10% to 20% range in 2024.\nTurning now to our midterm model. Despite the longer-than-expected downturn in the Mobile Test market, and the softness in Robotics and demand, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of our Test and Robotics businesses. This is shown in the update to our midterm earnings model. At the midpoint in 2026, we expect to deliver earnings per share at over 2x the 2023 level and a revenue growth of nearly 60%. As we've noted in past calls, the key drivers of that growth include process node advances to 3-nanometer, 2-nanometer, gate all around and backside power delivery. These are all on track or even accelerating, and they enable higher transistor counts, higher complexity, and that drives longer test times.\nGood progress in the emerging VIP space with key wins at design-in targets and a high share at 2 of the 3 leading ASIC design houses, all of which drive future revenue. Advanced packaging, including chiplet technology, which requires higher test intensity at the wafer level, driving longer test times. Compelling applications of EDGE AI for ADAS and smartphone co-pilots that are driving demand for more processing power, more memory and wider bandwidth communications. All of these factors accelerate test demand.\nThere is an aggressive road map for increases in Memory interface speeds in DRAM, HBM and Flash, that will continue to drive technology-driven retooling in the Memory market. And finally, in Robotics, we are still at less than 5% market penetration, and we are confident that our channel strategy will unlock the long-term growth potential of this market. In addition, the application of AI is expanding the range of tasks that our robots can serve, while our new products will expand our served market and decrease the effort required for customers to automate.\nAt the company level, compared to last year, our growth outlook has shifted to the right, but the slope of expected growth is largely unchanged. The duration of the downturn in mobile demand has been longer than we expected, and the softness in the Industrial Automation market that we and our peers have seen, has really impacted our expectations of growth in Robotics for 2023. Sanjay will provide more financial details of the model.\nAs we look at our results for 2023 and the outlook for 2024, we are focused on improving gross margins and maintaining tight financial discipline, while making the necessary R&D and customer-facing investments required to capture the long-term growth potential in both the Test and Robotics markets. To maintain that financial discipline, we will be looking to see signs of top line growth before allowing OpEx to materially increase. We operate our business with midterm plans that track long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than trying to predict short-term cycles.\nIn any given year, results will land above or below that trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning. As expected, 2023 was below trend line but the underlying demand drivers remain in place, and we're executing our plans to capture that future demand. We're excited about the opportunities ahead, and we have deep confidence in our team's ability to capture those opportunities. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q4, the full year 2023, provide our Q1 outlook, some planning guidance for full year 2024, review our updated earnings model and outline our capital allocation plan.\nNow to Q4. Fourth quarter sales were $671 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.79, both in line with our guidance. Semi Test revenue of $431 million and SOC revenue of $327 million with high memory shipments of $104 million, as Greg noted in his highlights. System Test group had revenue of $86 million, down 14% from Q4 '22. Growth in Defense and Aerospace was offset by weakness in Storage Test and Production Board Test. LitePoint revenue of $25 million was weaker year-over-year due to continued weakness in cellular and PC markets.\nRobotics revenue of $129 million was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year and up 50% sequentially on seasonally high demand and the impact of UR20 and UR30 new product shipments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.6% in the middle of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $245 million in Q4, up $2 million from Q3 '23. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 20.1%.\nSome other financial facts. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 12.6% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of geographic mix. GAAP tax rate was 14% in Q4, excluding discrete items. We repurchased $51 million of shares in the quarter.\nTurning to the full year results. We had revenue of $2.676 billion. Texas Instruments was the only customer greater than 10% of our revenue for the year. Gross margin for the year was 57.4%. OpEx was $990 million, and operating profit was 20.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.93. We generated $426 million in free cash flow in 2023. We returned $468 million or 110% of free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We ended the year with $937 million of cash and marketable securities. Our tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 15.25% on a GAAP basis.\nSemi Test revenue for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, with SOC revenue contributing $1.43 billion and Memory $386 million. Our SOC sales contracted 16% in 2023, in line with the continued mobility market weakness, partially offset by strength in Auto and Industrial. In Memory, our sales grew about 4%, driven by new technologies like UFS4 and Flash and LPDDR5 and HBM and DRAM.\nSystem Test group had revenue of $338 million in 2023. Combined Defense and Aerospace and Production Board Test sales were both flat while HDD and System-level test in our Storage business were down in total nearly 50% from 2022. In Wireless Test, revenue of $144 million in 2023 was lower year-on-year, given the decline in handset units and continued weakness in the networking and PC markets.\nNow to Robotics. Robotics revenue in 2023 was $375 million with UR contributing $304 million and MiR $71 million. The group had mid-teens profitability in Q4 '23, but for the full year, had an 8% non-GAAP operating loss. While UR was profitable in 2023, we continue to lean into R&D and channel enhancement investments in MiR. Now to our outlook for Q1. Since our October call, SOC Test demand has softened, which impacts our Q1 outlook. Q1 sales are expected to be between $540 million and $590 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.22 to $0.38 on 162 million diluted shares.\nThe first quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter gross margins are expected to be the low point for the year and are estimated at 53.5% to 54.5%, due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. OpEx is expected to be roughly flat with Q4 '23 and run at 42% to 46% of first quarter sales. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 10%.\nA few points to assist you in model in 2024. First, the gross margin profile. In 2024, we expect gross margins to increase through the year. Gross margins are forecasted to improve to 58% to 59% for the full year driven by improved product mix, including the sale of the Device Interface Solutions or DIS business, lower business resiliency spending and operational improvements.\nMoving to the strategic partnership we announced with Technoprobe in November 2023. The agreement has several key components as follows: first, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne's DIS business. This business provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers' chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of their outstanding shares. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces, to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems.\nWe expect the transactions to close in the second quarter. DIS had 2023 revenue of $103 million and the sale will reduce Teradyne's expected 2024 revenue by approximately $100 million, assuming the Q2 close date. It will not have a material impact on earnings. We plan to account for our investment in Technoprobe, using the equity accounting method. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we expect full year 2024 OpEx to increase 5% to 7%, driven by strategic projects to grow share in our Test businesses. The growth will be back-half loaded.\nRobotics is expected to grow revenue 10% to 20% in 2024, enabling Robotics to be profitable. The group will have a similar revenue profile as the company with second half expected at 56% of full year revenue. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 16% in 2024, excluding discrete items.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent, as we take a balanced approach to maintain a minimum cash level of $800 million, which enables us to run the business, have cash reserves set aside in the event of a significant downturn and have dry powder for M&A. For reference, from 2015 to 2023, we've returned over $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is 97% of our free cash flow. Earlier this month, we also announced a 9% increase in our dividend to $0.12 per quarter. We expect to close our investment in Technoprobe and our divestiture of DIS in Q2, which will consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to a minimum goal of $800 million.\nTherefore, we do not expect to materially reduce the share count in 2024. Moving to our midterm earnings model. As we do each January, we've updated our model. We share this with investors to provide insight into how we look at the markets we serve, our competitive positioning and ultimately, the growth and earnings power of the company. A few points for context. First, we've kept 2026 as at year-end so you can make an easy comparison with last year's update. Second, financial ranges are down to reflect our revised view of the markets in which we participate. Greg outlined the key drivers for the Test portfolio, including device technology trends, complexity and unit growth, which we anticipate will drive ATE growth over the 3-year horizon.\nOur Test revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 18% from 2023's muted level to 2026, driven primarily by a recovery in Mobility Test demand. For Robotics, we're looking at a strong market opportunity. The drivers over the midterm include labor shortages, new products and applications, including a growing range of AI-driven products and our channel transformation work. Our Robotics revenues are expected to grow at 20% to 30% CAGR from 2023 to 2026. The updated earnings model will drive 2026 revenue to approximately $4.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6.50 at the midpoint of the model range.\nOur model at the midpoint, as a revenue CAGR from 2023 to 2026 of 17% and on EPS at 30%, highlighting the operating leverage of both Robotics and Test portfolios. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx as a percentage of sales will be 28% to 31%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 32%. Summing up, we had a challenging year in 2023 and still delivered 20% operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. Generated $426 million in free cash flow and returned 110% of that cash to shareholders. We did this while we strengthened our competitive position in Test and Robotics with new products, invested in channel transformation and Robotics and announced a strategic partnership in Test Interfaces to drive Semi Test share growth.\nLooking ahead, we expect a return to growth later this year and beyond, driven by favorable trends in both Test and Robotics and the financial impact of that growth is reflected in our updated midterm earnings model. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. We'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up."

Welcome to the Teradyne Q3 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Andy Blanchard. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2023's third quarter along with our outlook for the fourth quarter.\nThe press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.\nWe encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings.

Looking ahead, between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, UBS and Wolfe Research.\nNow let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the fourth quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory Smith\n\nThanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q3 results, describe the current business conditions and provide some insight on how we're thinking about 2024 and beyond. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q3, our outlook for Q4 and offer some comments on the modeling next year.\nThird quarter sales and earnings were at the high end of our guidance range as robotics sales came in above plan, and we cleared some supply constraints and tests. The second half of 2023 is playing out as we described in July. We expect to close out the year with strong robotic shipments amplified by new product shipments at UR and seasonally softer test shipments.\nIn semiconductor test, the mobility correction cycle persists and shipments remain well below historic levels, while our automotive test shipments remain high in Q3. Memory test shipments in Q3 were down sequentially due to the timing of shipments, but demand remains strong. LPDDR5 and HBM, both of which require higher speed testers drove the results.\nIn Wireless, demand remained muted in the quarter given the weak smartphone market and lack of new wireless standards this year. In System Test, defense and aerospace and storage test groups were on plan, while production board test softened in the quarter. Robotics demand has stabilized. In the first half of 2023, demand was quite low down 21% versus the first half of 2022.\nIn Q3, demand strengthened with revenue nearly at 2022 levels and up 20% from Q2. Our shipments have stepped up as we execute an aggressive ramp of the new UR20 product and PMI seems to have stabilized a bit. Looking at the full year of 2023, our estimates of the SOC test market size are unchanged at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down about 15% at the midpoint from last year.\nThe weakest segment of SOC is mobility, down about 40% from 2022 on slower complexity growth in smartphone semiconductors and year-on decline in units. The compute Automotive and Industrial analog segments of the market will finish the year at similar levels to 2022. In Memory Test, we expect the market will be at the low end of the $900 million to $1 billion range, also unchanged from our July view.\nThe demand for high-speed DRAM test remains high as we close out 2023, which will help us pick up a few points of memory share for the full year. Teradyne's System Test group will finish 2023 down more than 20% from 2022. Within this group, we expect Defense and Aerospace will grow 10% year-on-year as global defense spending ticked up. The other segments of the business were negatively impacted by oversupply in the HDD market and mobility weakness.\nShifting now to Robotics. The macro environment for industry is incrementally better than last quarter with global PMI stable or improving slightly. The highlight of the quarter was a well-executed volume ramp of our UR20 collaborative robot. We delivered more than 300 units in Q3, and we expect to deliver a multiple of that in Q4. The UR20 extends UR's ease of use and quick ROI to higher payload and longer reach applications, expanding the market in many segments.\nThe strongest segments for UR20 so far are welding and palletizing. The distribution channel transformation that we described in past calls is also making steady progress. Complementing our existing distribution channel with direct coverage of large accounts and adding OEM partners is a long-term project, and we're beginning to see positive benefits.\nFor example, in the OEM space, we have added 48 new OEM partners so far in 2023, bringing the total to 144. And we have seen direct OEM orders grow nearly 20%, driven by the high demand from the palletizing market. At MiR, our account strategy continues to deliver with our top 10 customers expanding their collective installed base by over 15% year-to-date. A rate that's more than 50% greater than the overall installed base growth.\nShifting to the future, I'd like to describe our current thinking about 2024. Please bear in mind that it is still too early and visibility is too limited to be certain about what will happen next year. However, there are some longer-term trends that we expect to play out. As we've previously discussed, we expect the SOC market and our revenue to grow from 2023 on broader 3-nanometer adoption in the mobility space, driving market growth and continued strength in the compute market.\nThe real question is the magnitude of the mobility recovery, which depends on smartphone unit growth, complexity growth and how quickly the industry can consume idle test capacity. For reference, we estimate subcon tester utilization is still low, up only marginally from our July estimate and well below the typical Q2 to Q3 increase. The automotive test market has been sustaining at a higher level in 2023 than we originally expected. It appears that channel inventories in Automotive are stabilizing, and we have seen some spot weakness in the market.\nWe aren't expecting a significant change in the full year market size next year as unit forecasts and semiconductor attach rates driven by the crossover from internal combustion to EV remain bullish. The technology buys that have supported the memory TAM in 2023 should continue into next year, and we expect the memory market to grow as HBM, DDR5 and LPDDR5 penetration expands to support AI and computing growth.\nIn flash, as protocol interface speeds continue to increase, we expect flash package test demand to grow as well. Overall, we expect the total ATE TAM to be up modestly from this year, and the key factor is the strength of recovery in mobile. Growth in our wireless business, LitePoint will be strongly linked to handset growth, a recovery in the PC market and the start of the rollout of WiFi 7. The supply-demand imbalance in HDD is likely to persist through 2024, and we expect HDD test to remain [ leap ].\nSystem-level test will depend largely on smartphone unit growth in the near term while we expect our defense and aerospace business to grow in 2024 on increased defense investments worldwide. In robotics, we're finishing 2023 on a positive note in a tough market with Q4 revenues up about 10% year-on-year on the strength of the new UR20 product introduction. That performance reinforces our optimism in robotics. We see robotics as a marathon, not a sprint. We are serving in an emerging market of $2 billion this year that we expect to grow to tens of billions of dollars per year in the future.\nOur operating model for robotics is built for that marathon with a strategy that prioritizes product and support investments that deliver value to customers now. We are counting on building relationships with those paying customers to help guide our ongoing investments to meet their evolving needs for the future. The key to this strategy is driving towards our model of 5% to 15% profit from our robotics portfolio. While we will fall short of this objective in 2023, it remains a key operating metric for 2024.\nWe do this to ensure that we remain focused on our customers' most important automation priorities while we've grown the business. Rolling it all up, 2024 looks to be stronger than 2023. With all of the uncertainty around chip inventories, low utilization rates and macroeconomic worries. I'd call it incrementally stronger, but we'll get a better view over the next quarter or so.\nWe're also assuming a quarterly revenue profile in 2024, similar to 2023, with Q1 as the low point and then growth from there. While early, we're modeling Q1 sales to be similar to Q1 '23. As we finish the year, I'm encouraged by indications that our largest market, Semi Test, appears to have troughed in 2023 at a level that delivers an operating profit of 20% for the total company.\nWe are confident about the long-term growth outlook of the semiconductor market as the substantial fab equipment investments made in the recent past have not yet seen matching test investments. Also, we see consistent investment in tooling to enable continued process development, whether it is building a family of process nodes at 3-nanometer or enabling gate all around and 2-nanometer technologies. While the timing of test investments will be driven by end market chip demand and complexity growth, we are confident that this investment will happen.\nTo be clear, our customers are still cautious about their near-term demand, and we're reflecting that caution in our initial outlook for next year. But long term, there is significant upside potential. In Robotics, we have a pipeline of new products, new applications and distribution changes that are now beginning to yield. At the end of the day, the global population trends are inarguable.\nThe long-term demand for advanced automation must grow to deal with the increasing shortage of manufacturing workers, that coupled with market conditions that favor low-cost, short ROI automation investments and our team's growing execution skill. I expect renewed growth in robotics in 2024 as well. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3, provide our Q4 outlook and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now Q3. Third quarter sales were $704 million with non-GAAP EPS of $0.80, both at the high end of our guidance as robotics delivered above plan and some supply constraints eased in test.\nNon-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $243 million, down about 3% from the second quarter on spending controls and lower variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 22%. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 15.7% on a non-GAAP basis.\nSemi Test revenue for the quarter was $498 million with SOC revenue contributing $404 million and memory $94 million. As noted earlier, we continue to see strength in SOC concentrated in auto end market and image sensor parts of our business in the quarter. Memory sales continue to be weighted towards technology retooling for higher-speed protocol flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications.\nSystem Test Group revenue was $83 million with $38 million in storage test as SLT and HDD production demand remains [ muted ]. In Wireless Test, revenue was $37 million in Q3, with low demand from both PC and smartphone end markets. We expect this market trend to continue over the next several quarters. Now to Robotics. Revenue in Q3 was $86 million with UR contributing $71 million and MiR $15 million, which was above plan, as Greg noted.\nShifting back to the company level financials. Our free cash flow was $140 million in the quarter, and we returned 97% to shareholders. We repurchased $119 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $9 million of debt. We have the final $24 million of convertible debt, which will be repaid in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $820 million in cash and marketable securities.\nNow to our outlook for Q4. Q4 sales are expected to be between $640 million and $700 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81 on 162 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges. This outlook is in line with our July view at the company level for the second half. Our revenue guide for Q4 has no material supply constraints. As supply has become more in line with demand, we are now back to including normal supply issues in the revenue range.\nAs a result of supply and demand coming into balance, our lead times continue to improve. This enables customers to place orders more in line with their incremental production requirements. In Q4, there is a component of this behavior. But we expect to see more book ship variability in Q1 as lead times continue to be reduced.\nFourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%, OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of fourth quarter sales in line with Q3. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on gross margins and OpEx profile for the second half. Recall, our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range with margins of 59.6% and 59.2%, respectively.\nIn our July call, we noted the gross margin profile by quarter, which show lower gross margins in Q3 and Q4 due to the timing of spending to strengthen our supply chain, but that we expected our full year 2023 gross margins in the 57% to 58% range. That outlook is unchanged. Turning to resiliency spending. In operations, manufacturing spend will continue in Q4, but the spend associated with enabling our new factories to be qualified and producing testers is behind us.\nPacking up inventory and some capital equipment from old locations is what is left to do for our manufacturing in Q4. In short, we have successfully completed our objectives of moving many product lines to new locations. I would like to thank our internal teams and our partners for their tireless effort in derisking our supply chain. Some component qualification will continue in 2024 but the majority of the test operational resiliency spending is behind us.\nRegarding OpEx. As noted, our full year spend will be flat to slightly down versus 2022 spend levels. This is due to both spending controls and lower variable compensation. Recall, our operating model as a variable component for operating expenses, where the model flexes compensation expense with revenue and profits as both are lower than 2022 levels, we're spending less than 2023. As revenues are expected to grow in 2024 in future years, that variable compensation component will also grow.\nFor the full year 2023, at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue will be slightly below $2.7 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.85 and operating profit of 20%. Gross margin for the full year should be above 57.5%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 15.75% and 16.5%, respectively, in 2023. Looking at 2024 business levels, Greg noted we expected revenue growth in 2024. How much growth is tough to call at this point? Starting the year with Q1 '24 revenues, similar to Q1 '23 levels, Q1 is expected to have unfavorable product mix yielding lower gross margins in Q4 '23.\nFor the full year '24, we expect gross margins to be better than '23 on higher volume and lower resiliency spending. Summing up, our second half is playing out as expected with the highlight being strong execution by our UR team as they ramp UR20 to meet high customer demand. For the full year, while the end markets have softened in 2023, our company operating model has flexed costs down to support profitability while enabling our R&D and go-to-market investments to support our long-term growth objectives. We've transformed our supply chain to reduce geographic risk and strengthened our operations capacity.\nFrom a shareholder return perspective, year-to-date, we've returned 181% of our free cash flow to owners. Our cash position and strength in our balance sheet enables us to continue to invest in strategic organic initiatives and has the firepower to support a wide range of M&A options for inorganic growth in the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?"

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Andy. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2023's second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter. The press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.\nThe matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.\nDuring today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Citi and Evercore ISI.\nNow let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the third quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\n\nGregory Smith\n\nThanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q2 and first half results, comment on the current business conditions and our view of the second half. Sanjay will provide the financial details on Q2, our outlook for Q3 and offer some financial guideposts for the rest of the year.\nSecond quarter sales were at the top of our guidance range as supply constraints eased. Earnings were above our guide on higher gross margins. At the halfway point of the year, overall company performance has unfolded as expected, but at the segment level, test was incrementally stronger and robotics weaker.\nIn semiconductor test, we are 4 quarters into a correction cycle driven by excess inventory, which has hit the mobility part of the market hardest. Automotive demand has remained strong and in memory test, the growth of DDR5 and HBM devices for data center applications are driving retooling.\nIn our wireless and system test businesses, demand remains muted, unchanged from our April view. Robotics demand has softened over the past 3 months with worsening PMIs and the short-term impacts of the transformation of the UR distribution channel. Looking forward to the rest of 2023, we estimate the 2023 SOC test market will be $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down 13% to 21% from 2022, but up from our outlook in April. The continued weakness in mobility has been offset by sustained strength in the automotive segment. Also since April, the accelerating build-out of AI-enabled cloud computing is driving test demand for compute and networking.\nIn memory test, we expect the market will be at the low end of a $900 million to $1 billion range we described in April. In this market, the impact of AI is evident, especially in the HBM DRAM segment, where we see incrementally stronger test demand for Magnum products through the second half of 2023. Although HBM represents a small portion of the overall memory market, it is in a rapid growth phase, moving from under 5% of the test market last year to 10% to 15% of the market in 2023. And our HBM share is higher than our overall memory share.\nThis technology-driven strength is offset by weaker capacity buys, especially in flash for mobile applications. Despite the current downturn, we remain confident about the future of the semiconductor test market. The primary growth driver is an insatiable demand for increasing device complexity. This can be seen in cloud and edge AI applications like ADAS systems, spatial computing and privacy-focused consumer applications.\nThese require enormous compute power, higher wireless data rates and more sophisticated power management. We expect the automotive TAM will grow at a faster rate than the rest of the SOC market through this midterm driven by the growth of EVs and hybrids, broader adoption of features such as ADAS, cabin lighting and infotainment and the high test intensity required to achieve automotive quality levels.\nThe trend to vertically integrated producers or VIPs is a fundamental disruption to the computing segment and is beneficial to Teradyne. Companies that provide cloud computing, cloud AI and edge AI are seeking to differentiate their solutions by taking control of chip design. Efforts that began a few years ago are now beginning to proliferate in data centers and vehicles, and this trend will accelerate. Over the midterm, we expect the VIP portion of the compute segment will grow faster than the overall compute segment, and our share will be higher than in traditional compute customers.\nThe semiconductor industry has a process technology road map that supports these new, more complex devices. 3-nanometer is ramping now and 2-nanometer and Gate All Around are coming soon. In advanced packaging, we see broader adoption of stacked die for high-bandwidth memory and chiplets for processors. These new technologies will drive longer test times and retooling to test new interface standards.\nRolling that all up, our growth hypothesis for the semiconductor test market remains unchanged. A similar complexity road map drives our wireless and system test businesses. In wireless test, new standards like WiFi 6E and 7 require new or upgraded test equipment. In system test, increased device complexity is broadening the adoption of SLT and a very solid pipeline in defense and aerospace puts our system test group on a solid foundation for growth.\nShifting to the robotics portfolio. I want to take a moment to highlight that Ujjwal Kumar joined Teradyne earlier this month as the new President of our Robotics group, which includes UR and MiR. Ujjwal joins us from Honeywell, where he ran the Process Solutions business. His industrial automation and software background, combined with the deep experience in building businesses through organic and inorganic growth across multiple end markets is a great addition for Teradyne, and we are delighted to have him join our leadership team.\nIn the second quarter, Robotics demand softened significantly. The trends that we noted in April have continued and intensified challenging economic conditions, particularly low PMIs in Europe and the U.S. have resulted in lower demand in our highest revenue regions. We have previously noted that channel transformation work at UR was having an impact on pipeline conversion. This trend has continued in Q2.\nLarge account development and the build-out of the OEM channel are progressing well, but not quickly enough to cover for the market softness in the quarter. With lead times under 5 weeks, change in end market demand, especially with our current high exposure to small- and medium-sized businesses is felt quickly. However, there is no shortage in interest in our human scale automation products. We saw record lead generation from 2 major automation trade shows in the quarter, but there's a clear reluctance from customers to place orders in the short term. As a result, we are now projecting full year revenue for our Robotics group to be flat to down 10% from last year.\nDespite the difficult macro environment and the short-term impact of our distribution changes, we believe that we will emerge from 2023 in a stronger position in Robotics. On the new product front, we began shipments in the quarter of our higher payload longer-reach UR20. Customers serving welding and metal fabrication and palletizing across a number of industrial verticals have driven demand for the UR20 and a triple-digit unit backlog. We will see our first UR20 revenue in Q3 and ramp shipments through the second half.\nWe also introduced MiR Insights, a cloud-based tool to enable MiR customers to monitor and optimize large fleets across multiple workflows and sites more effectively. We are transforming the UR distribution channel in 2023. Recall, we are complementing our existing distribution channel with direct touch coverage at large customers and adding OEM partners that have high long-term growth potential.\nIn the short term, it appears this shift is slowing sales from distributors that were dependent on a high level of UR sales support. Longer term, however, the change puts our focus on customers with the highest revenue potential. Although these changes will take several quarters to yield, we're confident that we're on the right path.\nWe've added 28 new OEM partners so far this year and are working with our distribution partners to directly engage with over 200 large customers.\nAt MiR, our focus on large accounts is yielding good results. This year, our installed base at large customers has grown 3x the rate of our overall installed base. We view Robotics as a long-term opportunity. The market drivers are clear: aging populations, rising wages, labor shortage and the reshoring of production to reduce cost and cycle time. We have innovative, market-leading products serving a market that has the potential to grow to tens of billions of dollars per year. Our customers have already demonstrated the value of our product and ecosystem in their operations, and they're partnering with us to extend our robots performance to expand the range of tasks they are planning to automate.\nTeradyne brings the foundational expertise in engineering, operations and customer support needed to enable UR and MiR to become premier providers of human scale automation. We are putting the structure in place to support $1 billion in profitable sales by the end of the midterm. This is a long-term project, but we are seeing the early signs of this work yielding.\nWrapping it all up, our test businesses are performing better than planned through the first 6 months, and we expect that performance to continue through the second half. Automotive and memory are our strongest markets in test this year and a combination of inventory reductions and new products should enable the mobility market to recover next year. Our Robotics business was below plan in the first half. And while we expect a stronger second half for the group, we expect to be below our growth and financial plan for the full year.\nOur plans to transform our distribution and expand our product line are on track. We are carefully managing our spending in this business while we execute these changes. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q2, provide our Q3 outlook and full year planning assumptions. I will also update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress.\nNow to Q2. Second quarter sales were $684 million, which was at the high end of our guide, with non-GAAP EPS, $0.79, which was above our high guide of $0.74. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.8%, above our guidance due to deferred resiliency costs until later in the year and improved product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, flat with the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was 22%.\nWe had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.2% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $475 million with SOC revenue contributing $355 million and Memory $120 million.\nAs Greg noted, we continue to see SOC strength concentrated in the auto end market. Memory sales were weighted towards technology-driven buys as the industry ramps new, higher-speed devices like protocol flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications.\nSystem Test Group Q2 revenue was $94 million with $38 million in storage test, which has been down all year on continued low SLT and HDD production demand. In wireless test, revenue was $44 million in Q2 with ongoing low demand from both PC and smartphone end markets.\nNow to Robotics. Revenue in Q2 was $72 million with UR contributing $58 million and MiR $14 million, which was below plan, as Greg noted. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom-line results. Shifting back to the company level financials. Our free cash flow was $104 million in the quarter. We repurchased $135 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $2 million of debt. We have $33 million of convertible debt remaining. We ended the quarter with $813 million in cash and marketable securities.\nNow to our outlook for Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $650 million and $710 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81 on 163 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring and other charges. This outlook is above our April view at the company level, but under the covers, test is incrementally stronger and robotics softer. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%. OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of third quarter sales down slightly from Q2.\nNon-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on our revenue and gross margin profile for the second half. Our revenue guidance excludes approximately $35 million of test demand tied to supply constraints in Q3, which we expect to resolve in Q4. As a result, we expect Q4 revenue to be similar to the Q3 level. If we clear some of these supply constraints earlier, some Q4 revenue and resulting profits will shift into Q3. That will put second half revenue at roughly 51% of the full year.\nShifting to gross margins. Our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range with margins at 59.6% and 59.2%, respectively. In April, we noted that we expected full year 2023 gross margins to be at 57% to 58% due in part to transitory cost of adding new manufacturing sites for our test products, geographically multi-sourcing components and subassemblies to reduce supply line risks.\nWe're also developing multi-country capability of some of our design services work. In past calls, we noted expected margins to be lowest in Q1 and improve through the year. However, the timing of these resiliency costs shifted to later in the year, which was a driver of outperformance on gross margin in Q1 and Q2. Since that spending will now happen in the second half, our margins in Q3 and Q4 will drop to reflect these costs.\nNet-net, we continue to expect 57% to 58% gross margins for the full year, however, some of these transitory resiliency costs have been deferred until the second half of the year.\nRegarding OpEx for the full year. No change from our prior guide as we expect full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Now to profitability for Robotics for the full year. As Greg mentioned, we expect lower Robotic sales for the year. Even at these reduced revenue levels, Robotics' gross margins are above the corporate average, and while we expect UR to be profitable, the Robotics group overall is now expected to have an operating loss for the year. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 16.5% and 17% respectively, in 2023.\nSumming up. Our stronger test businesses in Q2 more than balanced weaker Robotic shipments, leading to sales at the high end of guidance with gross margin improvements, yielding profits above our high guidance. We're executing our plan to improve the resiliency of our supply chain and engineering services. We're modeling full year gross margins in the 57% to 58% range, in line with our April outlook, and are on track to hold our full year OpEx flat with last year. We have a strong balance sheet to support organic and inorganic growth while we continue returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Operator, we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up."

First, Greg will comment on our results and the market conditions as we enter the second quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the second quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour.\nGreg?\n\nGregory Smith\n\nThanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q1 results, comment on the current environment and outline how we see the market developing. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q1, our outlook for Q2 and some thoughts on full year planning. From a financial perspective, we delivered first quarter sales above the midpoint of our guidance range, with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins.\nIn Q1, our flexible business model enabled us to convert improving component availability in Semiconductor Test into additional revenue and profit, and our robotics businesses delivered on plan for the quarter. Stepping back from the Q1 results, I would like to outline our view of the current market conditions and how we expect the next few quarters to unfold. In Semiconductor Test, lower end market demand and high channel inventory is persisting. And our measures of tester utilization in Q1 of 2023 are at their lowest level in over 10 years.\nThe weakness is concentrated in Compute and Mobility SOC test and reflects further erosion in end market demand in 2023. After a 20% decline in PC shipments in 2022, they are forecast to decline an additional 4% this year. Smartphones dropped 10% in 2022 and are forecasted to drop another 4% in 2023. We have clearly seen utilization weaken as well. Inventory levels in these supply chains come into balance and the utilization levels improved, we expect test demand for these markets to remain at low levels. As a result, we don't expect any 10% customers in these end markets in 2023.\nOver the past 4 years, the Compute and Mobility segments have represented over 70% of the SOC market, so weakness in these segments has an outsized impact on the overall industry. There are, however, several factors beyond inventory alone that make forecasting in this cycle challenging. These factors are likely to impact both the depth of the cycle and the shape of the cycle recovery.\nThe first is the strength in the other roughly 30% of the SOC test market, automotive and industrial test. The demand that we're seeing here is stronger and more persistent than we expected in January. Tester utilization at IDM customers that drive this sector is substantially higher than at OSATs, which primarily serve the Compute and Mobility markets. In fact, high demand has pushed out our tester lead times for some configurations to be longer than our target.\nWafer capacity expansion plans announced by many of our automotive and industrial customers bode well for sustained demand for us in these segments. Strength in these segments is being driven by a wide range of new and growing device applications such as EVs, autonomous driving and the digitization of industrial activity. We also see these customers working to replenish the inventory that has been depleted over the last 3 years. This strength suggests that the depth of the SOC test market decline of this cycle may not be as deep as past cycles.\nAnother factor that makes this cycle very different is very strong tester demand from China-based chipmakers. The current test buy rate is substantially greater in 2022 and higher than the broader market and may not be sustainable at these levels. In the vertically integrated producer category, we have seen no slowdown in R&D or design-in activities. However, we expect low OSAT utilizations to significantly impact production capacity buys in 2023.\nWhen taken together, these 3 factors make it challenging to predict the timing and the strength of the recovery. Having said that, we do have better insight into the full year than we had 1 quarter ago. We estimate the SOC market in 2023 will be between $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion, down about 20% to 30% from last year's roughly $4.7 billion. We expect our share of the SOC market will increase 2 or 3 points from last year's 36%.\nI will note that we have increased our 2022 market size estimate by $100 million since January. In the memory segment, while oversupply is limiting capacity expansion investments the technology transitions we discussed in the past are continuing to drive test demand, especially for LPDDR5 and high-speed FLASH. For the full year, we expect the market to be flat to down 10% from last year's approximately $1 billion level. This is unchanged from our view in January. We expect our share to be in the high 30s, also up 1 point or so from last year.\nWe know that the global trends have driven over $300 billion of wafer front-end investment over the past 4 years, and that has not yet fully been converted into the testament. When coupled with a forecast of an additional $160 billion of investment over the next few years, we think the fundamentals for midterm growth are strong. In our LitePoint Wireless Test segment, we see a more familiar correction cycle. We are also a year or so away from the next big complexity leap in connectivity, the transition to WiFi 7.\nAs a result, our early view has LitePoint sales down 20% to 25% from last year's level. In System Test, the storage portion of the business is impacted both by reduced demand for HDDs and declining smartphone shipments. As a result, our System Test group revenue will likely be down 20% to 25% for the year.\nNow turning to the robotics businesses. Robotics revenue in Q1 2023 is down 14% compared to Q1 of 2022. The first quarter of 2022 was the last strong quarter before the invasion of Ukraine and slowing industrial growth began to significantly impact our results. As we've discussed in prior calls, there are both external and internal factors that are limiting the growth of our robotics business. And addressing these challenges remains a high priority for our Universal Robots and MiR teams.\nAt Universal Robots, we see a mixed picture. The external market conditions remain weak. Overall sales softened and were lower in Q1 than in the same period last year. However, shipments to Europe have returned to their highest level since then. And in the United States, demand slowed substantially in Q1 after a very strong Q4. Demand in Asia also softened in the quarter. In most years, we see a weaker Q1 as strong Q4 shipments are digested. But it is clear that the manufacturing economy is also slowing as indicated by weakening manufacturing PMIs in Q1 for almost all repays.\nThe primary internal factor that is impacting our growth is the ongoing realignment of our distribution system. Recall, we're shifting resources to put more focus on opportunities at large customers and OEM partners that have higher long-term growth potential. We are seeing some short-term headwinds from the shift in resources. An important positive for Universal Robots are strong preorders for our new high-payload UR20 cobot. We expect to have a backlog of over 6 months of volume shipments when we begin deliveries midyear.\nThe UR20 has already won numerous industry awards, including a recent Robots Business Review innovation award. At MiR, where we're coming off record Q4 shipments, we're seeing similar industry-level headwinds, along with seasonal slowdown in Q1 demand. However, our strategy to increase direct engagement with large accounts is latching with installed unit growth of over 40% in this sector from Q1 of 2022.\nWith the persistent weak macro environment and with little evidence to suggest a near-term change in these conditions, we've brought our full year revenue estimate for our Robotics group downward to be 0% to 10% growth from last year's $403 million. I would like to emphasize that despite the current market conditions, our view of the long-term growth potential for robotics remains unchanged. It is clear that there is a large and growing market for collaborative robotics, driven by labor shortages and escalating labor costs.\nOur strategy is to address this market with an expanding range of applications for our robots and a focused distribution strategy that we expect to yield an average 20% to 30% annual growth over the midterm. The fundamental drivers of all of our served markets, Test and Robotics make them as attractive as ever. We are focused on continuing to operate efficiently with strong financial discipline as demand begins to recover. With our flexible business model, we will maintain the careful investments in our products and capabilities that are the fuel for our future profits.\nI'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and the full year planning assumptions. I will also provide some financial color around our robotics companies and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress.\nNow to Q1. First quarter sales were $618 million, which was $28 million above our mid-guide with non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was above our high guide of $0.52. Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.7% above our guidance due to favorable product mix, operational efficiencies and some resiliency costs deferred until later in the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, flat with fourth quarter OpEx. And non-GAAP operating profit rate was 17%. We had no 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 16.75% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $415 million, with SOC revenue contributing $347 million and memory of $68 million.\nAs Greg noted, SOC strength was concentrated in auto and industrial end markets. In memory, our sales were strongest in flash final test followed by DRAM final test as the industry ramps new, higher-speed devices from smartphone and server applications. System Test Group Q1 revenue was $75 million with $34 million in storage test and low SLT and HDD demand.\nRecall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market and as widely noted, HDD markets are weak this year. In Wireless Test, revenue was $39 million in Q1 on the impact of both low PC and smartphone volumes and a low in complexity driven test investments ahead of the expected WiFi 7 rollout beginning in 2024.\nNow to robotics. Revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $72 million and MiR $17 million. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom lines. Profitability was negative in the quarter on weaker revenue growth. We are trending toward a breakeven profit this year, below our intended 5% to 15% operating profit objectives. Gross margins continue to be above the corporate average.\nGreg has noted reasons for growth in 2023 below expectations, which is preventing us from achieving our profit goal this year. I would like to share some thoughts to enable an appreciation of where we are with each business. In UR, we have conviction in this very large market and believe it is still sub-5% penetrated coupled with our products and ecosystem leadership. One of our challenges is our distribution approach, which we believe has limited our longer-term growth.\nWe are executing a solid plan to move to an omnichannel, which we believe will significantly enhance our growth potential. In the slower market we're seeing this year, our traditional channels are being impacted by an outsized rate before we see a full effect -- full benefit of our new channel strategy. From a profitability perspective, UR has operated above 10% to 15% -- sorry, UR has operated at or above 10% to 15% profit since 2017, with the exception of the initial COVID year in 2020.\nIn 2023, we expect profitability of UR to be in that 10% to 15% range. In short, we are profitable while we continue to invest in transforming our channel, introducing new products, which increase our served markets and growing our industry-leading ecosystem.\nTurning to MiR. MiR is earlier in its life cycle and serves a more fragmented AMR market where there is no clear leader and the top players have less than 10% share of the market. MiR is in the top 5 participants with mid-single-digit share. We're not yet profitable at MiR, we expect to be in 2025, which is aligned with our strategy to establish a leadership position in a market with long-term upside potential. This market is also less than 5% penetrated today.\nGiven the strong pull from our large customers, we're making substantial R&D investments needed to realize the opportunity. An attractive feature of this market is the relatively concentrated customer base, which enables a focused distribution with heavy direct involvement in sales, service and product requirements.\nIn summary, UR is profitable with a leading market position, and we're evolving our go-to-market approach. MiR is in the heavy engineering investment phase, creating solutions in cooperation with large customers, and we expect it will be profitable in 2025. Gross margins and robotics are above the corporate average and if we do not see significant growth opportunity in the market will reduce growth in OpEx and enable this portfolio to have greater than 20% operating profits similar to our Test businesses.\nShifting back to the financials. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $22 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay out our variable employee compensation. We repurchased $93 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $15 million of debt. Note, the share repurchase program began in late January, so it reflects approximately 2 months of purchases.\nWe ended the quarter with $859 million in cash and securities. Now to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $625 million and $685 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.74 on 164 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. This outlook is slightly ahead of our January view as automotive and industrial semiconductor test demand continues to outpace our earlier forecast. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 37% to 40% of second quarter sales roughly flat with Q1.\nNon-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 19%. A few points to assist you in the modeling in the rest of the year given the unusual environment Greg has described. First, the expected revenue profile. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve a bit from there. As a result, you should expect the second half will be a bit better than the first.\nNow to gross margins. We've improved gross margins in the first half of the year, driven by accelerated operating efficiencies and deferral of manufacturing resiliency spending to the second half of the year. Full year gross margins will likely be 57% to 58% range. Regarding OpEx for the full year. As noted in January, we expect the full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 17% in 2023.\nA quick update on our supply chain. While supply and demand is coming back into balance for most of our supply chain, we continue to see shortages in some analog and logic devices. This is impacting about 25% of Tester revenue in Q2 and is outside of our guidance range. On the supply chain resiliency front, while some spend moves from first half to second half, strengthening of our supply chain is progressing largely according to plan. For our tester product manufacturing, that work will be substantially complete in Q3, though there will be component qualifications continuing for several quarters after Q3.\nThe changes in our supply chain for our hardware services business will continue through the year. The costs related to strengthening our supply chain are included in the gross margin estimates. Summing up, we delivered sales above the midpoint of our guidance range with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins. The auto and industrial Semi Test markets in '23 look incrementally stronger than we expected earlier this year with softer mobility and compute markets.\nRobotics demand is also incrementally softer. In this environment, we're making the investments to strengthen our global supply chain, while maintaining the R&D and go-to-market focus to support our long-term growth strategies in test and robotics. We're doing this while maintaining roughly flat OpEx since 2021. As a result, we expect to generate solid free cash flow in '23, which will deploy to maximize value for our shareholders through potential M&A, dividends and shareholder repurchases -- share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nVice President, Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. And Latonya we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nThank you, Daryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta.\nFollowing our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's fourth quarter and full year, along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2023.\nThe press release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.\nThe matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor language contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings.\nAdditionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of events occurring after this call.\nDuring today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial as it were available on the Investor page of our website.\nLooking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Citi, Susquehanna, Luke Capital and Morgan Stanley.\nNow let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the first quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour.\nMark?\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nCEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'm going to limit my remarks today as Greg will be taking full leadership of the company from next week. I'll leave the outlook to Greg, and Sanjay will provide the financial details, including our updated midterm earnings model.\n2022 was another good year for Teradyne with our second highest sales in history. Midyear, we saw a turn in our markets with the SOC test market softening after 6 years of growth and Industrial Automation growth slowing.\nAt the company level, our financial results were slightly under the long-term trend line after operating well above trend in 2020 and 2021. This oscillation around the trend line is a familiar pattern that we expect to continue.\nWe manage our business investments according to this trend line and tend not to chase these excursions up or down. Sanjay will note how these trend lines roll into our updated midterm earnings model.\nLooking at a longer-term perspective, over the last 8 years, Teradyne's revenue has about doubled and EPS has grown about 4x. Growth of our core test markets is part of the story, as is expansion into new markets like Industrial Automation and System Level Test.\nThis, combined with a rich cash flow and a balanced capital allocation plan, has been the recipe for shareholder returns. As you will hear, we see all of these drivers remaining in place for the years to come.\nSince this is my last earnings call, I would like to thank all of you who follow, invest and influence our journey at Teradyne. As Greg takes on the role, I'm confident we won't miss a beat, and he's been a key part of developing and implementing our strategy for many years.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Greg for his deeper perspective on our results and outlook. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize the full year of 2022 and then comment on our early view of 2023. For the full year, we delivered sales of $3.155 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $4.25 per share.\n2022 was the second-highest revenue in company history but down 15% from 2021's record level due mainly to reduced demand in SOC test, specifically in mobility and compute. This offset was -- this was offset somewhat by strength in the automotive end market, including substantial demand for ADAS processor test.\nOverall for 2022, we estimate the SOC test market was about $4.6 billion, down 6% from '21, and the memory market was down a similar amount for the year.\nIndustrial Automation grew about 7% in dollar terms. Foreign exchange was a major headwind in that business. Our growth was 15% in constant currency.\nI'll divide my comments on market conditions into an early view of 2023, followed by our outlook for the midterm.\nIn July of last year, we noted the Semi Test equipment market was entering a downturn, with demand declining in end markets such as smartphones. This began to create chip supply/demand and inventory imbalances.\nWe noted these types of corrections typically have a 4- to 6-quarter duration. Now we're a bit more than 2 quarters in, and as the downturn continues, our customers continue to rebalance their production and inventory with end market demand.\nMuch of the imbalance is in test-intensive end markets like smartphones, compute and networking, where we see lower utilization.\nAt this point in time, with limited visibility into the second half, we estimate a market size for SOC tests to be 10% to 30% below 2022's $4.6 billion level. Major SOC producers are expected to start the transition to 3-nanometer later in 2023, and this could mitigate the headwinds a bit.\nOur historically largest end customer is expected to lead this transition, and revenue driven by this customer is expected to grow in 2023, moving from less than 10% of our revenue in 2022 to low double-digit percents of revenue for this year. Demand won't be finalized until Q2 and will be weighted towards the second half of the year.\nIn general, our models factor in 2 key demand drivers, unit volume and device complexity. We've read the same press reports that you have, that smartphone volumes are likely to be down in 2023.\nThe complexity growth associated with the 3-nanometer transition is likely to offset the test demand impact of the unit decrease, and the net effect is the increase in revenue that I've described.\nOur assumption that this transition is going to be gradual is likely to mute the peaks, but it will also fill in the troughs as the full portfolio migrates to 3-nanometer.\nOverall, averaging across the entire life of a process node, like 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, we expect that each new node will drive continued higher test investment in total than the prior node. On top of that, increased unit growth and the addition of new part types to the portfolio will drive further increases in test investment.\nIn the memory test market, technology transitions continue to drive demand. Faster interface speeds in DRAM with DDR5 and in flash with UFS 4.0 cannot be tested on existing testers and are driving purchases of next-generation ATE.\nOffsetting this technology-driven replacement demand is a difficult end market for our memory customers, which is likely to reduce capacity buying for this year. We are seeing some impact of that in the first quarter.\nOn balance, we expect the memory test market size to be flat to slightly down from 2022. We expect Storage Test will be weak in 2023 due to excess capacity in the HDD end market. And Wireless Test demand will be soft on lower smartphone shipments and a demand lull in advance of the transition to WiFi 7 beginning in 2024.\nShifting to Industrial Automation. As we expected, the macro outlook in industrial markets is cautious, with weak industrial PMIs. We expect this will be a growth headwind in the first half of the year.\nRolling up these headwinds and offsetting factors over the first half of the year, our current judgment for the total company has our second quarter about flat with Q1. However, in Industrial Automation for the full year, we have 3 notable factors that should help offset these headwinds later in the year.\nFirst, we do not expect the currency exchange impacts we experienced in 2022. Second, growth initiatives that began in 2022, including a channel transformation at UR, will gain traction.\nOne component of the channel transformation is supplementing our traditional distributor channel with a focused OEM channel. That effort delivered 26% growth in 2022, and we expect this to continue in 2023 as our existing OEM partners continue to grow and we add additional OEMs and targeted verticals.\nThe third factor driving IA growth is expanding the served market through new products. Most notably, in 2023, shipments of the new long-reach, heavy-payload cobot at Universal Robots, the UR20, which will ramp in the second half of the year.\nBarring a significant deterioration in the macro economy and reasonably stable currencies, we expect channel expansion, combined with new products, to drive greater than 20% growth for IA in 2023, weighted to the second half of the year.\nNow shifting to the midterm outlook. The short-term changes in customer buying patterns in semi cap equipment can be abrupt. We built our flexible operating model to accommodate those cycles.\nOur midterm plans track the long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than the short-term cycles. In any given year, we will land above or below trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning.\nSanjay will be going through a quantitative view of our 2026 earnings model. To set up that discussion, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments to provide some context. Our 2026 earnings model shows significant revenue and EPS growth, and it's reasonable to ask why we assume midterm growth when the short-term environment is so weak.\nThere are several factors that give us confidence in our midterm outlook. End markets, like AI and cloud computing, mobile processing and automotive, including ADAS and EV, are driving increased semiconductor content and increasing chip complexity.\nThe deployment of advanced wireless standards will support ever higher data volumes and the pervasive deployment of edge AI. This end market demand will drive the timeline for new semi fab nodes and packaging technologies, like 3-nanometer, chiplets and gate all around.\nWe have seen these technology transitions drive demand for test as the new nodes enable more complex chips and multichip packaging technologies like chiplets drive higher quality level requirements. Both of these factors drive longer test times and higher ATE TAMs.\nBut the landscape is changing. These complex chips are increasingly developed by a new class of vertically integrated producers, or VIPs, including hyperscalers and automakers.\nWe've had good design-in success to date with this emerging customer type, and these VIPs provide Teradyne with an opportunity to grow share in a space long dominated by legacy x86 architectures, where our share has historically been lower.\nThese large, complex devices are used in uptime-critical applications and will require exceptionally low defect levels. To achieve this quality level, our customers will increasingly adopt an additional test step, system-level tests or SLT.\nWe have a strong footprint in this growing market, and our design-in success with new customers is expected to be a growth driver over the midterm.\nOver the midterm, we expect to see WiFi 7 ramp and the rapid expansion of UWB-enabled devices for both precision location tracking and security. These new standards obsolete existing test instrumentation, and this replacement cycle will be a growth engine over the midterm for both SOC test and Wireless Test.\nTurning to IA. Global labor shortages and converging regional wages will continue to be unrelenting demand drivers. Market penetration for collaborative robots, including AMRs, is under 5%, providing enormous opportunities for long-term growth.\nThe steady application of new technologies in our products will continue to expand our served market, and the transformation of our channel will enable us to serve a broader range of customers and drive revenue to the $1 billion level in 2026.\nSumming it up. Over the midterm, our strong core test businesses will support share gain and trend line growth, while IA will grow to be about 20% of company sales and become a meaningful contributor to earnings.\nIn 2022, we have planted the seeds for future growth. We expanded our design-in footprint in the vertically integrated producer space and recognized substantial revenues from this emerging market.\nWe expanded our customer base in SLT. We grew our IA sales in challenging business conditions and set the foundation for higher long-term growth at both Universal Robots and [Newark].\nWe're in a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor capital industry, and visibility in downturns is always a challenge. We expect sales and earnings to be below our midterm trend line in 2023.\nWhile we don't have line of sight to an inflection in demand, that's typical in these cycles. The market will recover, and we expect to return to historical growth rates driving strong earnings over our midterm planning horizon, as Sanjay will describe.\nBefore turning it over to Sanjay, I would like to thank Mark for his more than 40 years of service to Teradyne and his 9 years as CEO. He has steered the company through an extraordinary period in the semiconductor industry and helped to assure our future growth through our investments in robotics.\nMore personally, it's been an honor to work for Mark during that period. His candor and insight has made me and all of us at Teradyne better. Although we're facing a cyclical downturn, we're facing it as a company with tremendous financial strength, a great team and a clear strategic vision, thanks to Mark.\nNow Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q4 and the full year 2022, provide our Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. Now to Q4.\nFourth quarter sales were $732 million, which was approximately $20 million above our mid guide with non-GAAP EPS of $0.92. Semi Test revenue of $481 million was strong in Automotive and Industrial and SOC.\nSystem Test group had revenue of $100 million, down 22% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in Storage Tests serving a weaker HDD end market, slightly offset by higher defense and aerospace and Production Board Tests.\nLitePoint revenue of $40 million was down 23% from a year ago due to lower cellular and WiFi demand. Industrial Automation revenue of $110 million was down 2% from fourth quarter of last year, but up 7% in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP gross margins were 57.4%, above our guidance, due to favorable product mix and some resiliency costs deferred until the first half of '23. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $252 million, about flat with third quarter OpEx. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 23%.\nWe had one customer -- we had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 12.3% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of geographic mix. We repurchased $2 million of shares in the quarter.\nTurning to the full-year results. We had revenue of approximately $3.2 billion. QUALCOMM was our one 10% customer for the full year. Gross margin for the year was 59.2%, OpEx was $1 billion, and operating profit was 27.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.25. We generated $415 million in free cash flow in 2022.\nWe returned $822 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and ended the year with $1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 16.3% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nSemi Test revenue for the year was $2.1 billion, with SOC revenue contributing $1.7 billion and memory $373 million. Our SOC sales contracted in 2022. But I'll note a bright spot for us in Automotive, where year-on-year shipments increased over 60%. In memory, our sales declined about 6% and were roughly evenly split between flash and DRAM.\nSystem Test group had revenue of $469 million, which was flat to 2021. Strength in defense and aerospace and Production Board Test was offset by a decline in our storage business.\nIn Wireless Test, revenue of $202 million in 2022 was lower year-on-year, with declines in cellular and connectivity partially offset by strength in UWB.\nNow to Industrial Automation. IA revenue was $404 million, with UR contributing $326 million and MiR $77 million, which includes . Notably, MiR grew 26% for the year in constant currency, 19% in dollars.\nLarge portion of IA sales are outside the U.S. and sold in local currencies. For the full year, 40% of the IA sales were in Europe, 35% in the U.S., 11% in China and the remainder in the rest of the world.\nFrom a profitability perspective in IA, the group was slightly above breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis for the full year.\nNow to our outlook for Q1. In October, we expected Q1 revenue of approximately $640 million which was projected to be down 10% from our Q4 midpoint.\nSince then, 3 declines have occurred: First, approximately $20 million of revenue was pulled in from Q1. Second, we expect approximately $20 million of supply constraints in Q1, which has not been included in our guidance range.\nThird, approximately $20 million of memory related to capacity additions has shifted to later in the year, including other offsetting factors.\nQ1 sales are expected to be between $550 million and $630 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.28 to $0.52 on 165 million diluted shares. First quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nFirst quarter gross margins are estimated at 55% to 56%, down from Q4 due to lower volume and higher spending on accelerating our manufacturing and service resiliency. OpEx is expected to run at 39% to 44% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 14%.\nA few points to assist you in the modeling in 2023. First, the gross margin profile. In 2023, we expect gross margins will be below our model in the first half, driven by lower volume and additional spending on accelerating our manufacturing and service resiliency. We expect second half gross margins to return to our 59% to 60% model range.\nRegarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat, compared with 2022. IA profitability is planned to be in the range of 5% to 15% profit level on higher volume. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 16.75% in 2023.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent as we take a balanced approach and prioritize free cash flow to maintain a minimum cash level to run the business and to have reserves set aside in the event of a significant downturn.\nExcess free cash flow will be prioritized for M&A, share buybacks and dividends. Prior share buyback authorization was replaced with a new $2 billion authorization. We expect up to $500 million of repurchases in 2023.\nMoving to our earnings model. We expect test and IA growth will drive 2026 company revenue to approximately $5 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $8.75 at the midpoint of the updated model. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx as a percent of sales will decline to 26% to 28%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 31% to 34%.\nSome context on the model. Over the last 6 years, Teradyne has grown revenue at a compounded 10% rate and our non-GAAP EPS at a 19% rate. Our model midpoint, we -- at our model midpoint, we expect the 2016 to 2026 extended trend line for revenue and non-GAAP EPS CAGRs will be -- to be 11% and 19%, respectively, roughly in line with the historical rate and reflecting an increasing contribution of revenue from Industrial Automation. We have included a backup slide in the deck that illustrates these trends.\nIn prior calls and Greg's comments today, we have outlined the key drivers for the test portfolio, including device technology trends, complexity and unit growth, which we anticipate will drive ATE growth over the 4-year horizon. Our test revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 13% from 2022 to 2026.\nFor IA, we believe this market is still sub-5% penetrated. Greg has outlined the drivers over the midterm for this market, including labor shortages, new products and applications and channel transformation. Our IA revenues are expected to grow 20% to 30% from 2022 to 2026.\nSumming up. After 6 years of growth, the SOC test market slowed in the second half of 2022, and our financial model flexed down as designed.\nDespite the smaller test market, we delivered 27.5% non-GAAP operating profit, generated over $400 million in free cash flow, returned over $800 million to shareholders, reduced our share count by 4% and ended the year with $1 billion in cash.\nGoing forward, our updated model builds on proven foundation of historical growth in test and IA and includes new drivers of future growth. While there is uncertainty in the short run, we are confident of the growth opportunities in the markets we serve and our team executing our strategy to capture that growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew Blanchard\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Daryl, we would now like to take some questions. (Operator Instructions)."

Welcome to the Teradyne Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.\n(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Andy Blanchard.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's third quarter along with our outlook for the fourth quarter of '22. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening.\nWe're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings.\nAdditionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor page of our website.\nLooking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, Credit Suisse and UBS. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the fourth quarter.\nWe'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Mark?\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nCEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andy. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. In today's call, Greg will review our 3Q results and 4Q outlook. I'll then describe the longer-term view, and Sanjay will provide the financial details of the quarter. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Teradyne's third quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $827 million and $1.15 in non-GAAP earnings per share. At the company level, the quarter unfolded generally as planned, but at the operating level, we cleared some supply bottlenecks, which allowed us to ship more semiconductor test products than planned in the quarter.\nOn the other hand, Industrial Automation was weaker than we forecast in July. Putting the third quarter into context, when we spoke in July, we noted that slowing SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half were related to declines in the end-market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure.\nWith that backdrop, we reduced our estimate for the SOC market size and reduced our second half shipment plan approximately $300 million. About 1/3 of that amount was already confirmed in June and about 2/3, $200 million was our judgment on how the second half would unfold. In the subsequent 3 months, about $110 million of the $200 million additional decline was realized and about $90 million was not as overall test demand held up better than we expected in July.\nThis incremental strength and test has been partially offset by weaker IA demand as reflected in the Q4 guidance. The highlight and Semi Test is the continued strength in Automotive Test demand. This year, we're seeing a step increase in our shipments for ADAS processors, silicon carbide drive and charging ICs and battery management devices.\nOur UltraFLEX platform is well aligned to the unique requirements of multibillion transistor ADAS processors and our Eagle platform is well suited for the thousands of volts and hundreds of amps often required for silicon carbide devices. It's notable that these 3 device types collectively will add over $100 million of incremental SOC TAM in 2022, and they were insignificant 5 years ago.\nShifting now to Industrial Automation. Because only about 30% of our sales are transacted in dollars and there have been significant changes in exchange rates in 2022, we'll describe results in both constant currency and dollar terms. In constant currency, Automation Group Q3 revenue grew 7% from last year's Q3 and is up 19% for the first 9 months of the year.\nIn dollar terms, however, revenue contracted 2% in the quarter compared with Q3 '21 and growth is 11% for the first 9 months. Looking at the full year, we expect IA growth from 2021 will be about 6% in dollar terms at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. In constant currency terms, IA growth will come in at about 14%.\nEven using constant currency terms, this is below our 2022 plan to grow in the mid-30s from the 2021 level and reflects 2 additional factors. First, slowing industrial activity, especially in Europe, where PMIs dropped below 50 in July and have remained in that contraction zone since.\nEurope is our largest end market for automation, and this is a 10-point headwind to growth. Second, labor scarcity continues in our distribution channel, which we expect to reduce growth by about 5 points. While 2022 growth is below our plan, we have a number of bright spots in IA, and I will highlight just a few. At Universal Robots, customer demand for our higher payload, longer-reach UR20 has been stronger than expected since its introduction midyear, and we expect it to be a meaningful contributor to results when it begins shipping in 2023.\nThe UR20 expands our capability in the palletizing, welding and machine-tending end markets. Also, we've continued to grow our OEM channel at UR including supporting partner expansion from national to international sales coverage. The OEM channel is a powerful growth driver for us. For example, our welding channel grew over 80% in the first 9 months compared with last year.\nAnd for this year, we expect to ship well over 1,200 robots in that vertical. At MiR, our sales to large customers continue to expand with more than 30 customers having fleet sizes greater than 20 robots. The number of customers with these large fleets has increased 30% in 2022. This is significant as our fleet management software is an increasingly important differentiator as fleet sizes grow.\nOn a related note, at the end of Q3, we merged AutoGuide into MiR as we prepare to offer customers a broad payload range from hundreds to thousands of kilograms sold by the same team using the same fleet management software backed by the same global distribution -- same global network of distributors, all while increasing our engineering, marketing and back-office leverage.\nFinally, MiR service and spares revenue has more than doubled to about 5% of revenue through the first 9 months compared with 2021 as we begin to expand our customer support offering. Across Industrial Automation, the investments we're continuing to make are giving us the foundation to support high growth with differentiated products to global customers through multiple distribution channels.\nWhile we are not satisfied with 2022's growth rate and have taken actions to improve, we remain confident of our long-term strategy in these growing markets. With that, I'll now pass it back to Mark.\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nCEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. I'll comment on the longer-term view of our markets and the impact of changes in the regulatory environment. Although better than estimated in our July call, the demand has slowed across our Test markets as we enter Q4. As I noted at the time, predicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last 3 corrections, growth has returned after 6 to 12 months.\nWe haven't seen anything in the last 3 months to change that view. So while it's too early to offer estimates on 2023 full year market size, based on the historical patterns and current market conditions, we expect next year's first quarter and first half demand to remain relatively weak. That, combined with the weak macro environment in industrial markets suggest that our Q1 revenue will likely be about 10% softer than Q4.\nLooking at the full year 2023, it's too early to make quantitative predictions but I'll point out how we're thinking about the balloons and anchors for the year ahead. First, the balloons. We expect the semiconductor industry to begin to transition to 3-nanometer technology and our largest customer to grow from less than 10% of company sales in 2022 to more than 10% next year.\nHowever, we expect them to be at a lower than historical past peak level as 3-nanometer will not hit full stride until 2024. In Industrial Automation, we also expect to grow year-over-year with the exact amount governed by macro conditions. Balancing these balloons are a few anchors. Semiconductor unit volumes and revenue are expected to decline in 2023 due to inventory digestion and macro headwinds.\nIn Industrial Automation, slowing industrial growth worldwide and a pronounced slowdown in European manufacturing are additional anchors. So we're keeping a balanced view of next year, and we should have a better view of the full year in January. Looking longer term, the case for growth in both Test and IA remains intact and compelling.\nIn Semi Test, we're operating on a market growth trend line of 10% since 2017. Growth in our Test businesses is driven by unit growth and complexity. We expect those drivers to remain in place as new semiconductor technologies such as 3-nanometer, gate-all-around and chiplets ramp over the next few years. These technology building blocks enable applications to continue to grow in complexity, including emerging applications like AI, ADAS and new compute architectures.\nIn Industrial Automation, we remain bullish on the future. While we're not immune to macro conditions, we recognize the underlying drivers of demand are favorable for cobot and AMR automation. Labor demographics and economics and the growing range of tasks our cobots can perform ensures an expanding market opportunity, and our strategy enables us to capitalize on that opportunity for many years to come.\nRegarding the recent changes in trade regulations, indigenous Chinese memory makers have been a significant and growing part of our Memory business. And while the new regulations mainly focus on fab equipment rather than test, tighter restrictions, combined with potential reduction in their wafer volume will likely impact our business.\nThis situation is dynamic, but as of now, we see these regulations as about a $75 million to $100 million headwind going into 2023. On the supply side of the trade equation, we have a large manufacturing footprint in China, and our global support team has a professional services operation in place to support local and global customers. As part of our resiliency planning, we have been enabling additional global sites for these activities.\nGiven the current environment, we will be accelerating the capacity growth of these other sites. Sanjay will take you through more details of those plans. Stepping back to look at the full year. Despite the drop in demand in the second half, we're on track to deliver our second highest revenue in history. We've balanced our growth investments with financial discipline and we positioned Teradyne for high growth as our core test and IA markets improve.\nSanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q3 results, update you on the impact of the new trade regulations and describe our Q4 outlook. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $827 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.7% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $247 million.\nAbout flat with second quarter OpEx due to implemented spending controls. Non-GAAP operating profit was 28.8%. We had [one 10%] customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items, for the quarter was 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 17.25% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate.\nLooking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $576 million with SOC revenue contributing $451 million and Memory of $125 million. We cleared some supply constraints, which enabled the highest level of Memory shipments in the past 2 years. In Memory, the transitions to new Memory standards in both flash and DRAM, along with strong demand from indigenous China customers drove the results.\nIn SOC, the increasing Semi content for EVs, autonomous driving and infotainment and autos, along with continued strength in analog industrial contributed to the demand. System Test group had revenue of $116 million with Storage Test delivering $70 million in Defense and Aerospace and Production Board Test $46 million. In Wireless Test at LitePoint, revenue was $46 million in the quarter, down 33% year-over-year, primarily because of lower WiFi revenue tied to declining PC and smartphone end markets.\nNow to Industrial Automation. IA revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $73 million and MiR $16 million. MiR results include AutoGuide. As Greg noted, a large portion of IA sales are outside the U.S. For the first 9 months, 41% of IA sales were in Europe, 29% in the U.S. and 11% in China and the remainder in the rest of the world.\nFrom a financial perspective in IA, the group was slightly above breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the third quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be about breakeven below the 5% to 15% profit range planned for the group. As growth has slowed this year, we've also slowed the growth in OpEx.\nShifting to supply. Looking at Q4, we continue to face supply issues, but the supply trend continues to improve relative to 3 months ago. These supply bottlenecks noted at the beginning of each quarter have moved from $50 million in Q3 to about $15 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts are outside the high end of our guidance range.\nSwitching to a strategic issue. We manufacture certain products and deliver certain engineering services in China for our global customers. While recent U.S. government actions have no immediate impact to these operations, due to concerns about potential future impacts, we are accelerating our strategy to expand our manufacturing and engineering service capabilities in other countries.\nIn manufacturing, this work has been underway for several years and we're accelerating the work to complete our expansion strategy in the next several quarters. In Engineering Services, the transition will likely take most of 2023 to achieve. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Please stand by.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nDid John say where we lost it?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nAndrew? Are we ready to go?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, please go ahead. Yes. We are live with the audience.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nBack to you, Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nI'll go back to shifting to the balance sheet. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million, about flat with Q2. We had $233 million in free cash flow in the quarter and our DSO came down from 74 to 58 days.\nUses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $217 million, dividend payments of $17 million and debt retirement of $10 million. Due to opportunistic buying through the year, we finished our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 for 3 months ahead of the original schedule. Our Board has authorized continued opportunistic share repurchases in Q4.\nSince our program began in 2015, we've repurchased 74 million shares at an average price of $45.85. Regarding debt, to date, $397 million of convertible bonds have early converted. Now to our revolver. During Q3, we worked with our banking partners and have increased the capacity of the revolver to $750 million from $400 million. Our credit facility is in place until December 2026.\nNow to our outlook for Q4. As Greg noted, our outlook is ahead of what we expected 3 months ago driven mainly by Semi Test. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $670 million and $750 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.62 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nFourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%, down from Q3 due to lower volume, product mix and spending on accelerating our manufacturing and service delivery resiliency. OpEx is expected to run at 34% to 38% of fourth quarter sales. On a non-GAAP operating -- the non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 21%.\nLooking at the full year of 2022. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2022 revenue will be $3.1 billion with an EPS of $4.08. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59%. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we spent a bit lower than planned in Q3 in both Test and IA businesses. We expect the full year OpEx will be about $1 billion up about 3% from 2021 at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance.\nRecall our operating model flexes OpEx with revenue. So growth has naturally trended down through the year. A couple of points looking ahead at 2023. First, gross margins. I will note that because of the additional spending on supply resiliency, and forecasted product mix, we expect Q1 gross margin will be similar to Q4's level.\nSecond, tax rate in 2023 is forecasted to be at 17%. We'll update our midterm operating model in our January call. Summing it all up, we're expecting higher revenue and profit in the second half of the year than prior update in July. Declines in our Test portfolio were less than forecasted, offset by weaker IA business driven by FX, continued economic challenges in Europe and labor scarcity in the channel.\nFor 2022, OpEx spending will increase year-over-year approximately 3% versus the 11% to 13% anticipated at the beginning of the year as revenue forecasts have declined from our view in January. In a challenging environment, regardless if the driver is economic downturn, regulatory changes, supply shortages, labor scarcity or whatever may come our way, we're confident we have a great team, strategy, operating model and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead.\nWe will continue to focus on our customers and the long-term opportunities in Test and Industrial Automation markets. With that, I'll turn things over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Andrew, we would now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the call over to Andy Blanchard. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CFO -- CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter of '22.\nThe press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening.

First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour.\nMark?\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nCEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Greg will summarize our Q2 results, and I'll comment on the full year outlook and technology drivers we expect in 2023. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the third quarter. Greg?\n\nGregory S. Smith\n\nPresident, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.\nTeradyne's second quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $841 million and $1.21 in non-GAAP earnings per share. From a market perspective, we're seeing mixed signals. While the pressure to improve lead times in some Test markets is as strong as ever, and we continue to work through supply issues, we have seen some softening in mobility demand, our largest Test market.\nAlso, it now looks like IA growth in the second half will be similar to first half growth.\nIn today's call, we'll try to provide some context on how we're navigating this complex environment. Diving into the details of the second quarter. Semiconductor Test revenues were in line with our plan as were profits. The Automotive and Industrial end markets served by our Eagle platform were notably strong in the quarter.\nIn Memory, Flash final Test and DRAM wafer sort was the strongest markets. From a strategic perspective, Semi Test had a strong quarter of competitive design wins for both R&D applications and for devices that we expect to ramp in volume production over the next year or so. The design wins were in a wide range of end markets. There were UltraFLEX family design wins in mobility, where the systems architecture supports higher throughput for large complex devices especially when time to market is an important factor.\nEagle Test had a significant design win in a battery management application where the system's highly accurate voltage measurement capability enables customers to get to market faster with better device specifications, delivering higher value.\nIn Systems Test, sales were on plan in the quarter with solid year-on-year growth for storage Test and production board Test. At LitePoint, strong wireless Test demand for WiFi 6E, WiFi 7 R&D and ultra-wideband Test products drove double-digit year-on-year growth.\nNotably, we're seeing strong interest in WiFi 7 development Test where we are qualified at all major chipset vendors and to date, we have won 20 of 21 design-in opportunities with end product design teams. This sets us up to expand our already high share of WiFi production Test as these products ramp.\nIn Industrial Automation, revenues grew 10% from last year's Q2 and 19% for the first half. This lower-than-planned growth in the first half is attributed to 2 primary factors and warrants a few comments. The first factor was foreign exchange. The majority of IA revenue is linked to the euro. For example, within Europe, at UR, we saw a robust 34% unit growth in the first half of 2022 but the decline of the euro with respect to the dollar has muted UR revenue growth in that region to 20%.\nThe dollars appreciation was a revenue headwind in the first half and Sanjay will comment further on the full year foreign exchange outlook.\nThe second factor is lower regional demand that can be traced to a variety of region-specific causes, including COVID lockdowns in China and distribution partner staff shortages in North America where end demand remains quite strong. Staff shortages for integration partners is an ongoing challenge.\nIn the past, we've noted that our distribution partners struggle to grow staff at the same rate as IA demand growth. Our strategy to overcome this is to use software technology and plug-and-play applications from UR+ and MiRGo partners to shorten the deployment time to make these critical staff more productive. But an equally important part of the strategy is to build a robust OEM channel. For example, at Universal Robots, our OEM channel, which includes verticals like welding, power grid maintenance and order fulfillment is doing very well, growing 39% in the first half of 2022. The OEM channel is an important complement to our distributor-based channel because these OEM partners deliver a mostly complete solution to their customers that can be put in operation almost immediately.\nIn many cases, these OEMs have an existing distribution network that can reach customers beyond our traditional channel. These partners can scale much more efficiently than distributors that add staff in proportion to revenue growth for customer support. We are actively adding new OEM partners to serve these and new market verticals.\nNow I'll hand it back to Mark for more on the market, the second half outlook and the demand drivers for next year.\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nCEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. While the long-term drivers in our Test and automation markets remain firmly in place, the recent deceleration we're experiencing in Test will impact our full year results.\nOver the past few weeks, we've seen a marked slowdown in SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half related to declines in end market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure. These demand adjustments are -- these demand adjustments are happening in real time, and we are projecting this will continue over the next several weeks as the market continues to align their production plans and inventory levels to this new reality.\nThis extends across multiple customers and device types, including apps processors, power management and RF. I will note that auto, MCU, industrial and Memory Test demand remains strong entering Q3 and we've seen no deceleration of demand in these markets.\nWhen forecasting the second half of 2022, we are expecting the Test realignments we've seen in the past few weeks are not a blip and that further adjustments are coming. Beyond the reductions we've already seen, several customers have indicated they are in a capital review phase, which we are assuming will lead to some additional impact to Q4 demand.\nAt a macro level, we also assume that China's smartphone volumes will not accelerate through the remainder of the year. We also believe that short-term global economic conditions will remain weak resulting in softening consumer demand and associated electronics inventory digestion.\nIn IA, we forecast that our second half business will continue to grow at about a 20% year-over-year level, consistent with our achievements in the first half but below our 35% goal.\nAs Greg highlighted, we believe that China demand will remain muted. Distributor labor shortages in North America will limit the rate of installation expansion in the short term and FX headwinds will not abate. Summing it all up, we now expect our second half revenue to be slightly lower than the first half, resulting in a roughly 52%, 48% first half, second half split. Our laTest forecast projects that 2022 SOC Test market will be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, down from our April estimate of about $5 billion, while in Memory, we expect the market will remain at about $1 billion.\nTo reiterate, much of our forecasted slowdown assumes continued yet to be identified demand decline in the fourth quarter.\nLooking further ahead, after 6 consecutive years of robust SOC Test market growth, we have entered a period of demand slowdown in digestion. This is not uncommon as we've seen this most recently in 2013 and 2015. And over the years, we've built our operating model to anticipate these kind of demand swings.\nPredicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last 3 corrections, growth returned after 6 to 12 months with the subsequent year showing strong growth. The ramp of 3 nanometer starting in 2023, followed by gate-all-around and increasing multichip packaging remains unaltered drivers of growth ahead.\nInterface transitions in both Flash and DRAM are also imminent. Hyperscalers continue to expand their chip design starts and edge AI as a new class of silicon application gaining momentum.\nIn Industrial Automation, the value proposition has only strengthened as the short ROI remains compelling while increased resiliency in a world of questionable labor supply as another motivation to automate.\nSo while the first half of 2022 unfolded roughly as outlined in January, the second half is looking considerably softer as we expected just 3 months ago. However, we are confident of our long-term growth strategy and are focused on execution of our design-ins and R&D programs so that we are positioned to capitalize on growth of these markets that we serve.\nSanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q2 results, offer additional color on how we're addressing the slowdown in some markets and supply shortages and others and describe our Q3 outlook.\nNow to Q2. Second quarter sales were $841 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.21, non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, $14 million below mid guidance. The main driver -- sorry -- the main driver of the lower-than-planned OpEx was an Industrial Automation Group or IAG due to lower variable compensation tied to lower revenue projections and slower-than-planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 30.3%. We had 210% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 16.5% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate.\nLooking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $541 million. SOC revenue was $461 million, driven by strength in automotive and industrial markets. Memory revenue was $81 million, led by Flash final Test and DRAM wafer sort. System Test group had revenue of $135 million, which was up 29% year-over-year. Storage Test sales, including both HDD and system-level Test solutions were $86 million in the quarter, up 49% from Q2 '21. Defense and aerospace and production board Test combined grew 4% year-on-year.\nAt LitePoint, revenue of $64 million was up 16% from prior year due primarily to strong shipments in WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 and UWB Test systems.\nNow to Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation revenue of $101 million in Q2 was up 10% year-over-year. This was lower than expected, as Greg noted. Despite the lower growth, we still expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year.\nUR sales were $883 million in Q2, up 8% year-over-year with the highest growth in Northern Europe. MiR sales were $17 million, up 9% from Q2 '21 in the quarter.\nFrom a financial perspective, in IA. The group was slightly under breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be towards the low end of the 5% to 15% profit range we discussed in past calls. We view the roughly 20% growth rate in IA as a short-term situation, as Greg noted.\nLike the company model, the IAG Group operating model naturally Flex is spending down based on profitability, and we're tightening discretionary spending where appropriate. But our long-term IA growth strategy and related investment plans remain unchanged.\nShifting to supply. Our Q2 guidance excluded approximately $50 million of revenue tied to our inability to supply customer demand. In Q3, we're excluding a similar $50 million of revenue from our guidance range, primarily in our Test businesses. The shortage of semiconductors ranging from FPGAs to industrial analog continues to impact our production.\nAs I've noted in prior calls, we're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain but even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain challenging. I will note these actions and other factors improved our supply situation in Q2, mainly in Test, which enabled higher shipments.\nShifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million, down from $1.2 billion at the end of Q1. We had $70 million in free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting the timing of shipments and supplier prepayments. Over 80% of our shipments occurred in May and June saw our DSO expanded to 74 days, which we expect will decline in the second half of the year.\nOther uses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $331 million, dividend payments of $18 million and debt retirement of $22 million. At the end of Q2, we're more than 2/3 of the way through our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 with $217 million remaining.\nIn October -- sorry, in our October call, we'll note any updates to our share buyback plan.\nRegarding debt. To date, $386 million of convertible bonds have early converted. I'd also like to note several points regarding the strong U.S. dollar and its impact on our results. In our Test portfolio, the majority of revenue and expense are in dollars, so there's not a material foreign exchange impact. In IA businesses, on the other hand, have a large amount of euro-linked expenses and about 50% of their revenue is tied to the euro.\nThe result is the strong dollar reduces IA's revenue and gross margin in dollars. In the first half, the FX impact reduced our IA growth rate approximately 4 points. Assuming exchange rates remain consistent with July's exchange rate, we expect 6 points of growth headwind for the full year compared to our January projection.\nFor IA, the strengthening dollar has a marginal benefit on the OpEx side. The revenue and margin degradation is offset by the OpEx gain, yielding a neutral effect on our operating profit for that segment.\nNow to our outlook for Q3. A combination of slowing demand and Test, extending lead times due to material shortages and reduced automation demand in Europe and China results in a lower Q3 outlook than we expected 3 months ago.\nAs noted, the guidance excludes approximately $50 million of shipments due to material shortages primarily in Test. Also, the guidance assumes we won't see any extended shutdowns of production facilities due to COVID, and we won't see any new trade restrictions.\nWith that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $760 million and $840 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.90 to $1.16 on 166 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%, down from Q2 due to product mix, 2022 investment supply chain resiliency and wage inflation.\nSome of these effects are transitory, and we expect our midterm earnings model gross margin range of 59% to 60% to remain intact. OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 34% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 26%.\nAs Mark noted, we expect second half revenue to be below the first half, approximately 48% of full year sales. Given the reduced revenue outlook for the second half of the year, our operating expenses are now planned to grow just 4% to 6% annually versus 11% to 13% planned in our prior guidance.\nThe OpEx reduction from prior guide is driven by 2 factors. First, our variable compensation model is approximately half of the decline tied to reduced revenue. Second, we have delayed some expenditures in both Test and IA, which we believe will not impact our long-run competitiveness. Spending savings are roughly evenly split between engineering and go-to-market.\nSumming it all up, we're expecting revenue and profit in Q3 and the second half of the year to be lower than we projected 3 months ago, but our operating model is resilient to varying revenue levels. With the reduced revenue level, our model reduces variable compensation expense, and we're taking other steps as appropriate.\nA downturn is always challenging, but we're confident we have the operating model, strategy and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead, while keeping our focus on the needs of our customers and the long-term opportunities in the Test and industrial automation markets.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Latif would now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up."

Mr. Blanchard, the floor is yours.\n\nSpeaker 2\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela, and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's first quarter, along with our outlook for the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in our earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.\n\nDuring today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We posted additional information concerning those non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, were available on the investor page of the website.\n\nLooking ahead, between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial focused investor conferences hosted by Colin, Luke Capital, Bank of America, [inaudible], and Bernstein.\n\nNow let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results, market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the second quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\n\nSpeaker 3\n\nHello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions, and provide an update on Q2 in the full year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the second quarter.\n\nThe first quarter played out as expected from a financial perspective. We delivered results toward the high end of guidance, as we cleared a few more supply chain bottlenecks than expected.\n\nAs outlined in January, we expect revenue growth throughout the year as we build toward 2023 and the transition to 3-nanometer. Consequently, we expect roughly 7% to 9% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth throughout the year.\n\nSince January, we've seen incremental strengthening of demand for semitest and wireless in the areas of automotive, memory, wifi, [inaudible], and seven.\n\nOn the other hand, for the first time in two years, supply chain challenges are materially impacting our semitest shipments.\n\nThis is reflected in our wider-than-normal revenue guidance range in Q2. Sanjay will describe these details shortly.\n\nFrom a full year market perspective, we estimate the SSC market is trended to the high end of the $4.6 to $5 billion range we discussed in January .\n\nStrengthening automotive test demand is one element driving the market increase as both per car content and unit complexity are growing quickly.\n\nThe accelerating move to electric vehicles is a key part of this increase, with EVs growing at a 20%+ [inaudible], while the chip content of these vehicles is running more than 3X compared to gas powered cars.\n\nThis year we are seeing particular strength emerging in high-end automotive ADAS processes.\n\nComplexity of these processes is approaching the level of high-end cell phone applications processors.\n\nAdditionally, high-end ADAS processors have about a 3-4x longer test time due to the more stringent test requirements for devices used in automotive safety applications.\n\nFurthermore, there are usually multiple ADAS processors per vehicle, amplifying the unit demand.\n\nCombining the enhanced EV semiconductor content with these ADAS trends, we expect the automotive test market to outgrow the core test market for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother area of growth is in hyperscalar silicon development.\n\nWhile the material test revenue impact from these complex chips in 2023 and beyond, both the complexity and pace of development is accelerating.\n\nThis has been a focused investment area for us over the last 18 months and we are pleased with our win -- sorry, pleased with our win rate for these new opportunities.\n\nShifting to the memory test market. Our market size estimate for the year remains at about $1 billion, but within that we have seen the DRAM demand soften a bit, offset by an increase in flash demand.\n\nIn system test, defense and aerospace and production board test groups collectively grew over 30% from Q1 '21 on strong automotive board test demand and program buying in defense and aerospace.\n\nIn storage test sales were down 28% as expected, versus 1Q of '21. Customer concentration here causes this lumpiness, but the long-term complexity and unit demand drivers remain in place.\n\nOur wireless test business at LitePoint remains very healthy, with sales growing 26% year-over-year in Q1.\n\nStrong demand for emerging Wi-Fi 60 and Wi-Fi 7 standards is driving this growth and the outlook for the year.\n\nLitePoint strategy delivers high throughput, easy to deploy test solutions for the full array of wireless standards.\n\nOur chipset test library approach to programming allows customers to shorten their time to market and achieve superior test economics for these emerging standards.\n\nMoving to industrial automation group, revenues were up 29% from Q1 of last year. Demand in North America was particularly strong, with 55% growth year-over-year.\n\nWhile we cleared some supply issues at UR late in the quarter, IAshipments overall continued to be constrained by material shortages.\n\nGlobally, the PMIs for the U.S. and Europe remain over 50, while in China the PMI dipped below 50 in March.\n\nWe are closely watching to confirm the China data point is a short-term COVID-19 lockdown issue and anticipate recovery in 3Q and 4Q.\n\nSimilarly, the conflict in Ukraine slowed EU demand in March, and it has the potential to impact European industrial activity throughout the year.\n\nWhile we expect these constraints to continue in 2Q, we do expect IA growth rates to increase through the year as supply constraints ease, auto guide begins to ramp shipments, and UR MiR increase growth on China and EU recovery.\n\nAt UR, our OEM welding application continued on a tear with 1Q growth of over 100% compared to one year ago.\n\nThe U.S. geography was also strong, with over 50% year-over-year growth.\n\nOur UR+ program of plug-and-play applications for our cobots is passing the 400 product milestone this quarter.\n\nEach of these applications leverages an independent third-party developer's knowledge of a specific market vertical to solve a specific problem.\n\nThis application is then certified by UR, so our customers can deploy automation solutions quickly by spending less time on programming and integration work.\n\nA resulting network effect is a powerful differentiator for us, and we continue to invest to support this growing army of developers.\n\nAt MiR, we are seeing two positive trends emerge as we grow the business.\n\nFirst, we are seeing a steady movement towards higher payload, higher ASP, AMRs.\n\nIn 2020, about 10% of our sales were above the 500 kilogram payload range. This moved to 22% in 2021, and in Q1, we saw over 30% of our sales in this class.\n\nThis represents a broadening of AMR applications to a wider range of material handling tasks, and manufacturing and logistics.\n\nSecond, we are seeing the trend toward both growing fleet sizes and increasing multi-factory deployments at major customers.\n\nWithin these environments, our fleet management software is an increasingly important product differentiator.\n\nThese larger customers also have demanding uptime and support requirements, which also plays to our strength, as MiR is leveraging paradigm's global support and large account experience to meet these customers' needs in ways that smaller players can't.\n\nWith one quarter of 2022 in the books, the year is unfolding roughly in line with our forecast. The incrementally stronger demand and test is being balanced by supply constraints.\n\nLonger term, I am encouraged by the continued strength in WFE investments, which fuels our growth. The progress from industry leaders on 3-nanometor technology.\n\nThe growing opportunity for our human-scale automation projects and the resilience of Teradyne's global team and our partners that are enabling us to muscle through some very tough supply and operational constraints.\n\nAnd before closing, I want to note an important milestone at Teradyne: Mike Bradley will retire from our Board of Directors in May.\n\nMike's paradigm career spans over 40 years, including 10 years with CEO , helping shape paradigm's products, business model, and culture.\n\nMike has had an incredible impact on our company, our customers and shareholders, and I am especially appreciative for the help he's given me along the way. Thanks, Mike.\n\nSanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, including the supply line update, and describe our Q2 outlook.\n\nNow to Q1. First quarter sales were $755 million with non-GAAP EPS of 98 cents. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $248 million, slightly below our guidance due to slower than planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 27.4%. We had no 10% customers in the quarter.\n\nThe tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 16%, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\n\nPlease note, you should now use this for the full year tax rate as well. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective.\n\nSemitest revenue of $482 million was down 9% from Q1 '21, as expected. SOC revenue was $387 million, driven by strength, mobility and compute end markets.\n\nMemory revenue was $96 million, driven by flash final test and DRAM wafer sort.\n\nSystem test group had revenue of $119 million, which was down 11% year-over-year, again as expected.\n\nStorage test sales, including HDD and system level test solutions, were $68 million in the quarter, down from $95 million in Q1 '21. Defense and aerospace and production board test grew year-on-year.\n\nAt LitePoint, revenue of $52 million was up 26% from prior year, due primarily to strong shipments of WiFi and UWB test systems.\n\nLooking at our test portfolio overall.\n\nLitePointThe positive demand environment Mark noted reinforces the trend line growth built into our 2024 earnings model. In semitest, growing device complexity supported by no transitions and unit growth will provide a long-term tailwind to that business. At LitePoint and in system test, similar increases in complexity continue to drive growth. A couple of examples: 1, LightPoint revenue in 2021 was approximately double the 2017 level. 2, our storage test business revenue and storage test has more than quadrupled from 2017 to 2021.\n\nAt LitePoint, we expect growth to continue to be driven by more complex wireless standards for connectivity, sophisticated location tracking, and security technologies and cellular applications.\n\nIn storage test, flowing chip complexity combined with higher density are driving long-term growth.\n\nNow to industrial automation. Industrial automation revenue of $103 million was up 29% year-over-year. This was ahead of what we planned in our Q1 guidance as we were able to work through several supply line constraints in the quarter at UR. I'll also note that we expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year.\n\nUR sales were $85 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year, with the highest growth in North America. MiR sales were $17 million, up 22% from Q1 '21. As Mark noted, higher payload products with higher ASPs contributed to that growth and we expect this trend to continue.\n\nOverall demand at both UR and MiR remain strong, as labor availability in rising costs make the financial case for our human-scale automation compelling. But, as noted, we are watching for the impacts of COVID events in China and the Russian-Ukraine war closely.\n\nFrom a financial perspective in IA, the group was breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the first quarter, and for the full year we expect operate in the 5% to 15% range we discussed in past calls, with 2022 trending towards the low end of the range. Recall in 2021, IA delivered a 4% non-GAAP operating profit for the full year.\n\nAs noted in the past, with market penetration for cobots and AMRs below 3% and high market growth, our strategy is to prioritize growth over obtaining model profits. Simply put, we are investing to capture these markets as we see significant growth beyond the midterm.\n\nShifting to supply.\n\nWhile the demand environment is strong, supply issues are getting progressively worse. We continue to manage through a very challenging supply environment, as we have for the past two years. Our supply management operations teams and partners have done an incredible job, including navigating through a multi-week plant shutdown at one of our major contract manufacturers in Q1. Fortunately, it was mid-quarter and we had time to recover. Had the shutdown happened later in the quarter, the recovery could have shifted into the following quarter.\n\nIt highlights the risk which will persist during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In Q2, there is more demand to ship if we could align supply.\n\nIssues range from chip shortages to COVID-related delivery shutdowns. We're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain, including expanding our production operations geographically, adding new geographically diverse suppliers, redesigning products to use available components, and many other actions. However, even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain an issue through at least the first half of 2023.\n\nShifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.2 billion. We had 37 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter. Cash burn in the first quarter is typical for us as we pay variable compensation and profit sharing in the quarter.\n\nWe spent $201 million and $18 million on buybacks and dividends respectively in Q1.\n\nAs noted in January , we expect to purchase the minimum of $75 million of shares in 2022.\n\nRegarding debt. To date, $384 million of convertible bonds have early converted in Q1.\n\nWe paid $21 million to bondholders in the quarter. Now to our outlook for Q2.\n\nAs you've heard this morning, customer demand is strong in all parts of the business.\n\nOur guidance range is wider than normal as a number of material shortages continues to expand and while we've been successful to date in addressing these issues, the margin for error continues to narrow, and the guidance assumes we won't see extended shutdowns of our production facilities due to COVID. With that said, sales in Q2 are expected to be between $780 and $870 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1 -$1.29 on 170 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles.\n\nSecond quarter gross margins are estimated at 60%-61%. OpX is expected to run at 31% to 34% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of the second quarter guidance is 28%.\n\nTurning to the impact of inflation on our PNL. First, gross margins.\n\nWe are seeing increased costs, primarily in components and labor, both internally and at our partners. We're mitigating those increases through a variety of measures, including product pricing, operational efficiencies, multisourcing, and seeing the benefit of our prior investments to reduce our bill of materials.\n\nOur gross margin performance in Q1 and outlook for Q2 reflects our success to date with these measures. But I remind you, this is a very dynamic environment.\n\nOn the OpEx front, we have planned for increased costs tied to inflation and we still plan on growing OpEx 11% to 13% over 2021, as noted in January .\n\nLooking at our revenue profile for the year, the first half is shaping up a little bit better than expected, with very tight supply.\n\nThe second half is looking to be slightly up versus last year's second half, reasonably consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year.\n\nEven though test demand is incrementally higher, supply issues may push some of that incremental demand into 2023. We expect third quarter revenues will grow high single digits from the Q2 level, and Q4 will grow sequentially as well.\n\nOur current view is that the first half revenues will be 46% to 47% and second half revenues will be 53% to 54%.\n\nTo sum up, demand across the company remains strong, and growing supply constraints are moderating our shipments more than at any other time since the pandemic began. We're expanding our playbook to address these issues, but it's a very dynamic playing field, and we're calling a lot of audibles along the way.\n\nOur global teams in go-to-market, operations, engineering, and support functions continue to execute and collaborate in a challenging and dynamic environment to meet customer demand and deliver shareholder value. The passion is enjoyable to observe. Well done, team. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Thanks, Sanjay. Chris would now like to take some questions and, as reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\n\nSpeaker 1\n\nThank you, sir. And again, as a reminder, to ask a question, you need to press *1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. Once again, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and standby as we compile the QA roster.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from CJ News of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nGreat Thank you. Thank you for taking the question, I guess. First question regarding your largest customer heading into 2023- and obviously that's a long time from now- But curious, as you think about the move to three nanometer, how are you thinking about test demand as it relates to units versus complexity and, I guess, the worry in the marketplace that the adoption of three could be spread out over two years as opposed to one and that would reduce kind of the demand for testers from you guys? So would love to hear how, how you're thinking about that, and obviously the caveat is it's very early to have a great great view there.\n\nThe fcj. It's really early on that, But first of all I think those two parts of your question.\n\nI think overall, we're looking at three nanometer in 2020. three is mostly a complexity growth equation versus a unit growth driver in the cell phone device Arena. I think the other part of your question is: well, what if the adoption is partial for three nanometers? Certain devices go to three and other 1- sort of lag. I think that is something we've seen before in iPads and other kinds of products in the market where they bifurcate migration.\n\nIf and whenind that ever occurs, there could be a one year.\n\nDepressed demand for test, but then in subsequent years those sort of bifurcated product lines kind of then move in lockstep again North. Maybe one's waterfall back a year, but the complexity growth resumes thereafter. So it's all hypothetical, but something like that would have an impact.\n\nVery helpful, I guess. For my second question, just trying to think through the, you're kind of stronger second half versus first half and obviously the robotics pieces is helping on that. But you know, this is the first time I think I've memever seen you guys have, you know, kind of a stronger outlook for semiest into the back half, where normally you know Q2 is seasonally is your strongest quarter. So is that all a factor of supply constraints or are there other drivers to that, that change in trend?\n\nWell there's three things going on there. The biggest thing Q2, is usually large because our largest customer has a big tooling peak in two Q and three Q, So that's absent. But the other thing is that visibility is a bit longer now with lead times out, customers are ordering a little bit.\n\nIn advance for capacity So we do see a little more of what's to come toward the back end of this year in early twenty-three and.\n\nAnd it sort of aligns to this complexity growth related to new notes that we're seeing. So I think this year is a little unique in that.\n\nAbsent the mobility bubble we usually see in the summer and adding in the move toward this node transition. Next year we get this more linear ramp through the year of demand.\n\nVery helpple, Thank you, Thank you.\n\nOur next question comes from med hoini IG. Your line it open, is that? Thanks for taking my question.\n\nWant to go back to your outlook, especially looking into next year, and you made a reference with wffe, which is very a positive, given all investment this year. But it also appears that the investment for tradiling agege is growing much faster and particularly higher level of investment in China. When I want to ask you: is how your position for China, especially for with OSAT houses, and is there any incremental opportunity for share gain? And I have a follow up: yes, I think.\n\nIn China we're positioned very well in legacy non leading edge. You know the one place in China we're not positioned well is with W Wei in the while Wei associated companies, which tends to, are trying to skew as best they can toward more leading edge positions. But to the extent China will continue to grow on trailing edge, you know. But you know overall our share of, let's say, the non W Wei part of China is roughly the same as it is outside of China. So you know it's not a balloon or an anchor, So to speakwe're kind of going to float up and down there, I think, with investment and demand.\n\nOk So nothing really out of ordinary. If they are indeed investing, more is should trickle down to the back in. You are one of the two and then moving on to industrial automation and thankends for color on ADAS and incremental opportunity. But it also seems to me that in order for you to fully realize the synergies between your semitas in the industrial automation for Ed and ad as application, you would need to have more of the software content. And I'm just curious if.\n\nIf I'm thinking about this the right way, and whether you would have to go to the market and acquire software IP that you can have a more comprehensive portfolio for these growth end markets.\n\nNo. I don't see that med I think where we are positioned. Now. We're completely aligned to the technology trends in evv and ADAS and everything else there so.\n\nNo I don't see the need for that. Okay, Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd next we have Timothy crcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nThanks a lot. So, Mark you, you were saying that the's's C TAM is trending toward the high end of the four point six to five billion. I'm just wondering if you can give us some idea of sort of what end markets driving that toward the high end. I think last quarter you give us some breakdown. You know compute: you thought would be A. you know billion three I think you thought mobility would be a billion eight you know autos would be about five billion. So can you just give us sort of what end market is driving that toward the high end? It sounds like autos might be a little better.\n\nSure high sanj here I'll take out when. So we're seeing strength in incremental strength in compute and in auto driving us to the high end.\n\nOkay and then I guess a question just around China. So are you seeing any impact or any pushouts or?\n\nDelays in shipment timelinesfrom Chinese OSAT customers as a result of the lockdowns and maybe just as a result also of weak demand in the consumer segments. So I mean obviously demand still very strong if you look holistically, But if you look at the consumer markets and you look specifically in China, are you seeing any examples of customers delaying shipments of testers?\n\nNo we're not seeing any tester real meaningful delays at all yet in China we have seen- and the industrial auto industrial automation business, the robotics business- some slowdown in China. sanj referred to the Q1 performance. There was a bit weak and we're watching that. So that's more immediate and you know, as factories shutdown in things, we feel that. But I think on the test side the, the headlights and the investments needed along the trend line are kind of obvious and compelling and there's no yet any blips very much.\n\nThank you, and next we have byanton of steees. Your line is open.\n\nI good morning.s, thanks for lling has ask a few questions. I guess the first one focused on test. Given the supply challenges that you're discussing, do you think you're baking in enough conservatism on the twotwenty-two can outlook? And I ask in part because I think, despite strong order rates, your competiittor advant, they widen their 2022 can outlook at the lower, not higher, end of the range.\n\nSo kind of curious about that. And also beyond your largest customer with telegraph last call, have you seen any incremental signs of capacity digestion in the broader SoC of mobile C market?\n\nSo just a quick comment for me first, and I'll let sanj talk a little more about it. I do think that, compared to advanest, we're in a very different supply chain situation. You look at their backlog out at almost a year. There's a very, I think, limited ability for them to see our road to incremental revenue in the yearwhereas work'.\n\nsix months in last versus one year, and we do have capacity growth capability in the back half. So that's a difference. But how? Let sanj addressed the broader question. I think overall supply is getting tighter. You know, said on prior calls, I thought with substrate and fab capacity coming online in 2022 would be a little bit more inimbalanceced with supply and demand, but that hasn't been the case. You know, as I said, our current view is that we see the tightening continuing into the first half of 2023 and, from an overall market perspective, you know, we do believe that there is a constraining element of supply to meet the overall demand and it's in the. You know it's in the places where you'd expect in, in semiconductor parts, you know F P GA, linear logic memory, other asix, that's. And as I miss the part I think asked about, where do you seeing any time digestion in the broader SSEC mobile market?\n\nNo not really, and I thinkthe demand is still strong and the requests for you shipments are not pushing out, So I don't see any signs yet in test of sort of slacking demand. Ok, just from my follow up, an industrial automation- sorry that this this, but it's sort of mid 30% plus. Still that the boge there in terms of growth rates of the that accelerated growth rates moving into the air, improvements on your early times, but also still some constraints. I think was a discussion also. Some want to see sort of how the pattern unfolds in China. So many can discuss then also you know what that China exposureres. I think it's the fairly minority part portion of the business right.\n\nYes So it's sandrea here. So So 35% plus is still our objective or a plan this year. It's progressing as we'd expect that. I would say that, as Mark noted China, which has traditionally been a very high growth environment- for I was- was slightly down year-on-year and, as Mark noted, we believe it's really tied to the plant shut down. So we're watching it very closely. I would say, on the supply front, a large, a significant portion of that range increase is tied to supply. What you are. The range is approximately, let'd say, two million, which is really supply driven range. And then secondly.\n\nI'd say secondly we are seeing supply from an IA perspective lead times or sorry. Our backlog will still be. We expect it to be between four to six weeks as opposed to our objective of one to two weeks to keep it. A fast ters business. So I do think the.\n\nThe China piece you know is roughly 10% of our overall eye business So it is flatlined in Q1 kind of on growth. But part of how we get to 35 plus through the back end of the year is assuming some of this coed stuff goes away in China and in Q3 and Q we're presuming it persists, or second quarter, but Q3 and Q4 it it goes away.\n\nOkay that's fair. Thanks so much without Thank you. Next question comes from tases molek of city. Your line is open.\n\nHi Thank you for taking my questionions Mark. You talked about weakness in the DRAM market. If you can just provide some more color, is this because of DDR five adoption pushed out because of supplier rapid the delay, or are you seeing something more?\n\nNow it's exactly that DDR five is moving slower than planned, kind of servers safhire Rapids delay, nothing fundamental. The three elements of the memory market between DRAM, wafer test, final test and then flash wafer test, final test kind of, are a quarter, a quarter or quarter each of the total billion dollar TAM. There is a bit more tooling this year for DRAM wafer test but that's nothing. I think that's noise not signal and, as I mentioned, we're seeing some strengthening in the flash side. That's sort of making up more than the difference on the DDR five weakness.\n\nThe other thing about memory that's very encouraging for us is that we've talked about our market share being about 40% low forty's globally. There in China, which is still investing heavily and growing quite rapidly in memory, it's moving closer to the high 50 S.\n\nSo we've got some good potential here with DDR 5, hopefully coming back next year with saffiire Rapids and the continued investments going into China.\n\nGreat it has up. I want to go back to C's question earlier about the mobile compute adoptions that maybe over in a couple of years that phone maker has publicly talked about facing physical and limitations and creating the larger die to com comitted more transistor, that five nanemeter which I don't believe was the driver in iPad type decision historically SOI mean, is it fair to assume that that the rightice maker could could adopt three nanemeter more widely moving forward, given the limitation on the diesite I think that's more likely a hypothetical question. I think the CJ was asking, but I do think so. Just to walk it back a little bitthis year we've seen a slackening demand in tester demand because the complexity growth is low in phone.\n\nSilicon, highly correlated with the fact that we're kind of in our third year of five nanometer production and yes, you just CAn't afford to grow the die size. It doesn't make economic sense to grow the die size and absent that, it's hard to get more transistors unless you do a node transition. So there's a bit of a backlog and a pent up demand to get to this next turn of the screw, the next node of three nanometer. So this is. This all depends kind of on the yields of what three minnanome is going to look like, But on the other side of the argument you could see a larger portfolio of devices.\n\nDriving to move to three nanometer next year and people will be competing for fab capacity if the yields prove to be good, and I think you want to be positioned with the customers who are in the front of the line on that fab capacity, which I hope we are. I think we arebut I would subscribe more to the fact that people are, there's a pent-up demand and it could swing the other way. Thank you veryhelpful.\n\nThank you next we have VI Bank of America an is open but that's but take my question. I just wanted to revisit this notion of this supplied situation getting tiedghter. How do we reconcide that the deal forecast of growing high sing of digit in Q2 Q3 and thank you forward this. My situation is getting tied. How are you able to go a faser what we've been planning for it. I think a couple of things we've been investing in multi sourcing of components geographically diversing. We've been building capacity. You know really tied to our plans that we published with our earnings model and you can see by our balance sheet. We're building inventory. So fundamentally we're planning forward and we're looking to execute and the other thing we've been doing is some redesigns to remove some of the bottleneck parts and as those redesigns sort of flow into.\n\nThe shipment stream in the second half of the year. That gives us some incremental flexibility. So it's usually it's a few critical parts that bottleneck us, that go through mad scrambles negotiations, phone calls and things to try to unlock some supply from the suppliers during the course of the quarter, and we've been largely successful for the past two years doing that. We're still able to grow here in Q2 doing that. It's just that the likely outcome is more and more.\n\nSort of constraints on the top end of what we might otherwise be able to ship. So, for example, in the second quarter, San J, roughly how much revenue and test? Are we thinking we bottleneck because of the line of sight we have on supply? Yes, So in test I'd say it's in the four million range and I'd say in IA it's in the one million range. And that is outside of our high end of our range, which is really, you know, unprecedented for us, right?\n\nSo that Gi, just some flavor of the magnitude and that's test. In the past quarters might have been one million kind of numbers small, but it's going in 10 to 40. that's significant and we look out in Q3 and Q4. It's judgment still, but we still think everything that sandj says we've done positions us to grow with reasonable.\n\nPerformance on clearing some of these critical parts and anticipating this constrained environment persisting in getting a little bit worse. Helpful and then. So my follow up Mark. I wanted to revis that, this content growth argument when you move from one note to another. So a few questions on that. First, could you give us a range of how much your average content grew in prior cycles and mobile SoC when your customer move from one generation to another? Was it 10% to 15%? 15% to twentteen percent? If you could just give us some sense of what that RAIN has been historically. And the other thing I'm curious about is that: will this require brand new testers or again, part of the deployed base upgraded? Just how much incremental is? Does this move to three nanometers? So you're not surprised when it happens next yearthankyou.\n\nI've got sure what you mean by the content growth, So just clarify that a minute, sure? So how does one quantify complexity? Right that if your average tester per unit of that smartphone is X when that SoC moves from five to 3, then how much extra tester revenue can you get from that for the same number of units? Yes So the.\n\nFirst of all, the second part of your question, which was reuse of testers. Testers are absolutely reused. No to no generation to generation, and testers we put in 10 years ago are still being used for mobile device testing. So long, long product life. They do need to be upgraded a bit now and thenthat's part of the flow, but there's no obsolescence of ventent coming in the short term around testers. That's not in our midterm plan and anything else and hasn't been in the past.\n\nSo the node transitions typically enable transistor count bumps, and that's what drives incremental test capacity, because the same device requires more test time.\n\nAnd so I think you could expect something in the rough jump of 30%. 40% jump in transistor counts drive, maybe a 20% jump in tester capacity. So you've got to do the math across.\n\nThe whole installed base of testers and everything else. So I haven't recently sat down and tried to pencil that out.\n\nSo I CAn't sort of do it off the top of my head, but that's roughly the ratio. Is that? What a no transition will give us is that big jump in transistor count. And then you could say okay, if- just to take an example- if the installed base of testers is 100 and there's no unit growth, all there RIS is a no transition of about a 30% to 40% complexity bump, you would need 20 more testers to cover that.\n\nIn that year. The model is much more complex than that. Of course, see that to sort of do it over years and model it, but that's the tips of the waves on it.\n\nVery helpful, Thank you, Thank you.\n\nAnd next we have car your line open. Thank you think my question I you of them to more thanks for the color on the industry market sizes. Given that the incremental strength in SoC is coming from auto and in memory kind of more retrigger towards NAND versus dam, is this PR to assume that your market share associ, C and memory is going to be about 40% this year, or do you think associ may be slightly higher, memory slightly lower than it? A follow upyeah, I think.\n\nFor the year. Memory is probably still around 40, plus or minus a percent or so, but around 40. I don't think it changes significantly with this flash shift in the case of SoC.\n\nI wouldn't say characterize it as much of a change. It's also probably slightly short- PO 40 for the yearand it ll kind of depend on.\n\nWhat happens in the supply chain issues as we get into Q4. I anticipate will be- and we anticipate in our discussion here that we're going to be- bottleneck. The 30- $4 million were botlenckhere in Q2 will likely grow as we get toward Q4 and if that in fact happens then we will probably be 30- eight percent to 30- nine percent share. If we can unconstrain that we can ship more testers off, it could be in the 40% range.\n\nArd gard mm, o. You kind of spoke about the three nanometers from the large customer next year. Historically there's been a little bit of a headwind to gross margin when they spend. We just kind of curious: should that be world or similar to historical trends? It next year auto test flows and the tailwindyou have this year from the Eagle test: high margin testers moderates as your large customer becomes a bigger portion in 2020. -three.\n\nYes Hi. It's Sanjay So So I think it's a good observation that as the mobility we'll call the bubble. If if we see that in 2023 on a margin percentage it will have an impact. But I will say that we are having investments that that continually work to both add supply assurance but also and give us flexibility but also drives from a bil materialsand. We've been fighting the cost or the component inflation but we plan to execute in our.\n\nAt our earnings model level of 59% to 60% be our expectation. Thank you, sunanjay. Thanks one Thank you up. Next we have to sha a hurry of Goldman Sachs. yonline is open.\n\nGreat good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. I had to as well. Mark, you talked about the hyperscale opportunity in your prepared remarks. I think you noted that some of the customer activity seems to be accelerating and that you've been pleased with your run rate. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit and, to the extent possible, kind of speak to the timing of a potential inflection in that business. I realizede that's sort of a medium to long-term opportunity for you, But curious to hear any new developments there.\n\nYes that's boy it's tough to speculate because there's two classes of hyperscalar silicon development that are going on there's a class of development around new consumer products that one is incredibly difficult for us to forecast because it 's.\n\nUnprecedented type product introductions to see if the market will develop or will they even be introduced. So to me those are their active, were highly engaged, their wildcards. Then there's another class that I would say is more compute: cloud infrastructure chips going into the cloud for specialized could be AI applications going into the edge. Those are a little more, I would say, have precedented applications and we have have long-term sort of plans.\n\nAnd those I expect are-'re going to start ramping next year. I think some of these are going to ramp now. How material will they be? I think we're still talking, from a tester point of view, tens of millions versus hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental revenue, So we're still going to be early innings. But that gives you some sense.\n\nGot it. That's helpful, Thank you. And then, as a quick follow up, youmaybe 1, sanj. You guys seem to be executing really well from a gross margin perspective, despite everything that's going on. I think you beat, you know, the midpoint of your guidance in Q1 by by more than one hundred basis points or're guiding to another. You know higher than 60% quarter for Q2, despite everything everything that's going on. So I guess the question is: is this primarily a function of your largest customer being absent, or at least being a small percentage of your revenue than than typical and and that driving a better mix, or are there? You know, I know you guys are working on a bunch of things. Is there anything sustainable that could drive margins above your long term model? Thank you.\n\nYes So in Q1 it was really a function of product mix and really operational efficiencies and execution that drove us beyond. But we guided in Q2 and beyond fundamentally.\n\nWe we're growing- IA light point is growing as examples and in 2022, we see those businesses having higher than corporate average margins. I do believe that, as we continue to work, we have plans and we're working towards margin plans that are accretive, but let me remind you that there's been significant inflation and component costs and labor are increasing, So we feel like we manage the business to a 59% to 50% gross margin over the midterm. We have internal plans that our challenging those to make them higher, but we're also realistic about some of the headwinds in play in the environment.\n\nVery helpful. Thank you, Thank you, and we have till more of mogan Stanley. Your line is open. Great Thank you. In terms of the supply constraints that you have, can you kind of frame that competitively? I feel like last year you had sort of a better supply situation than advantested. That's still the case in any ramifications for market share in the more transactional parts of the business.\n\nWell we're not inside advant to know a lot, but we do. What we do know from the outside is their backlogs close to a year. Their customers are forced to order in advance around a yearand And so yes apparently, whatever is going on in terms of supply chain strategy, it's been slightly more favorable on our side, but we've worked this.\n\nSince 20 19 20, 18 sort of as as a sort of a business continuity planning exercise around a whole series of things that could have gone wrong in the world. We never anticipated COVID-19 but But generally built up inventory, resilience and backups that have fared well for us for two years. So kind of. We've been hoping we would get through all of this without any significant bottleneck and we're seeing our first sort of headwind here in tested: about a $4 million bottleneck in Q2, So 5% of our revenue roughly. You know we might have been able to increase revenue 5% and maybe that's going to be about the percentage through the year that were going to be botl CK. We hope that we can keep it at that. Keep lead times in sort of a six month range in test and incrementally get some of advantes customers to consider us as a more responsive supplier. We'll see.\n\nGreat Thank you very much. Thank you, and next we have to thewhole of dosha bank. Your line is openthanks for taking my question. The just to one question for me, really to your largest customer: are you still expecting them to be a 10% revenue this year and given normally you have some good visibility into them in about this time approach- April maytime frame, is there much of variability for the rest of this yearthank?\n\nyeshi syney tanay thanks for asking the question. So right now our expectation is that we will not have that large customer V over 10% consistent with what we thought in January and I think on the.\n\nIs there any thing for the rest of the year I think for two Q and three Q no it's pretty locked in four Q frankly is a wildcard because that in past years has been a surprise for us. It depends on sort of the ramp in 2020 two The early silicon prove outs and all kinds of factors and and other products that might be launching. So fourth quarter is kind of still opaque to us. So I would say that if there's a potential for something in fourth quarter that we might not see yes But.\n\nBut we'll be somewhat constrained there too. Best based on the earlier supply discussions. Okay, Thank you, Thank you.\n\nAnd I see no further questions into queue, I will turn the conference back over to mth of lunchard. Sir, you may continuewell. For the first time, and over 40 quarters, we're finished early. Thanks everybody for joining us. Look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead by.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you all participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Teradyne Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2021's fourth quarter and full year, along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2022. The press release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. .\nThe matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we make no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.\nDuring today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor page of our website.\nLooking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne will be participating in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Citi, Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna.\nNow let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our results along with our guidance for the first quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Mark?\n\nMark E. Jagiela\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll summarize 2001's (sic) [2021's] 4th quarter and the full year and then comment on our early view of 2022. Sanjay will then provide the financial details and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. .\nWhile we forecast 2022 to be another solid year for Teradyne, overall sales will likely decline in the first half as we believe SOC test sales will be impacted by modest complexity growth in our largest market, as the jump to 3-nanometer production is pushed to 2023. More on that in a minute.\nRecapping 2021. We finished the year strong, bringing full year sales, non-GAAP earnings growth to 19% and sales growth to -- sorry, the sales growth of 19% and GAAP earnings growth to 29%, respectively. 2021's performance was a result of broad-based growth across our Test and IA businesses. Semi Test sales grew about 17%, with our UltraFLEX family contributing to the expansion into the compute sector and Eagle product lines serving the automotive and analog industrial sectors growing nearly 90%. For 2021, we estimate the SOC market was about $4.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2020, which puts our market share at about 46% for the year.\nThe memory market in 2021 was about flat with 2020 at approximately $1 billion. Our Magnum family continues to shine in the NAND segment, and we're reinforcing our position in the DRAM segment as the industry prepares for LPDDR5 and DDR5 ramps in 2022 and beyond. Our share remains at about 40%.\nLitePoint's wireless test business had a great year, growing 25% from 2020. The global demand for connecting and tracking, just about everything, machines, materials and people is nearly insatiable. LitePoint is well aligned to this trend with products that simplify testing of the expanding range of wireless standards. Whether in networking with WiFi 6E and 7, in location tracking with ultra wideband and cellular with 5G or numerous other standards, the rate of technology change continues unabated, which is great for our business.\nMoving to our Industrial Automation business. At UR, sales were up 41% from 2020. We continue to expand the number of UR+ partners and certified plug-and-play apps with assembly, machine tending and palletizing among the most popular of the more than 375 available apps. We also continue to broaden our reach beyond existing markets, often with OEM partners. One exceptional example is our expansion into welding applications, where we finished the year with a growth of more than 3x above 2020 levels. Welding applications now account for more than 6% of UR sales. At MiR, full year sales grew 42% from 2020 on the strength of our new higher payload MiR250, 600 and 1,350 kilogram AMRs. It's also notable that the value of mere AMRs with advanced fleet management software is amplified as the size of the robot fleet grows. We saw this play out last year with large account sales, those with the potential to deploy hundreds of units, growing nearly 50% faster than the installed base at large.\nLooking ahead to 2022, the long-term drivers that power our growth in Test and Industrial Automation are strong. In fact, as you will hear from Sanjay, our updated 2024 earnings model reflects an expected higher growth in sales and profits for both areas. However, in 2022, while we expect our IA business to power along with 35%-plus growth, we see our SOC business likely contracting during the year as the shift to 3-nanometer volume production is pushed to 2023. You can begin to see some of this effect in our 1Q guidance as we usually see the beginnings of our summer ramp in March. We expect 2Q to show similar effects as it's usually our peak tooling period for our largest market. As a result, we are modeling first half sales down 15% to 20%. We don't expect the impact of this to extend into second half. We expect demand to accelerate again in 2023 as we begin to see the complexity growth related to investments for 3-nanometer gate-all-around and advanced packaging. Overall, we expect the 2022 SOC market to be similar in size to 2021 at approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion.\nShifting to memory test. We expect the market in 2022 to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range with a midpoint that's similar to 2021. We expect spending will be weighted toward DRAM as LPDDR5 adoption expands and DDR5 for server applications ramp. In the past, a shift to spending in DRAM would be a significant headwind for us, but we expect we'll maintain our share at about 40% in 2022 as our Magnum EPIC DRAM tester grows in market popularity.\nIn System Test, after 5 years of high growth driven by the Storage Test product line, we expect 2022 to be a digestion year with sales softening slightly. Wireless Test at LitePoint, however, is expected to fill that revenue gap, so we expect the combined System Test and Wireless Test will be about flat with 2021.\nShifting from test to Industrial Automation. Our business outlook is brighter than ever. As I noted in our last call, the penetration rate of both collaborative robots and autonomous mobile robots is under 3%. The economic environment is favorable with worker shortages, the movement of production capacity closer to end markets and a relentless drive for higher quality and safer operations, all helping to drive demand. The opportunity in front of us is immense, and we are investing to exploit it to the fullest.\nAt the IA segment level, we've increased our long-term revenue growth rate and expect our sales in 2022 to grow more than 35% off of 2021. Sanjay will provide the long-term modeling details, but the key point is the investments we've made and will continue to make position us for both short- and long-term success in this expanding market.\nExpanding OEM relationships and served markets is a key part of our strategy. Like the welding initiative that is bearing fruit, we have several others in flight. One example is in e-commerce. One of our partners, Nimble Robotics, uses AI, unique grippers and clever software on our UR cobot platform to pick consumer goods and high-volume warehouse operations for numerous national brands. You may have seen the recent Wall Street Journal article complete with photos of the solution in action. Their innovative solution, dubbed goods to robot, complements automated storage and retrieval systems widely used in e-commerce. Our cobot ease of use and durability are a natural for this application. Well over 15 million items across 500,000 unique products have been picked to date as Nimble executes an ambitious growth plan in the e-commerce space.\nAnother driver of growth in IA has been the growing use of UR cobots to improve the competitiveness of local manufacturing to support reshoring of production. Pantech, a Finnish maker of high-quality ceramics is a good example. They've added automation to allow skilled craftspeople to focus on high-volume and high-value tasks while UR cobots do the repetitive and physically demanding ones, such as glazing and finishing of ceramics.\nTo summarize, 2021 was another year of impressive growth at Teradyne and caps a 5-year stretch where sales and non-GAAP earnings have grown at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. As we've said before, we've managed the business to a trend line model. Our updated 2024 earnings model shows improved growth trend lines reflecting our increasing confidence in the business. These projections are not hockey sticks. They are consistent with our past performance and correlated to investment trends in semiconductor capacity and automation market drivers. Along the way, we expect some years will perform above the trend line and other years below. In Test, 2020 and 2021 were above trend line years, while 2022 will likely be below. These year-to-year swings in customer buying patterns are a part of our market dynamics. Our underlying business model with outsourced manufacturing and test is designed to efficiently absorb these dynamics. Also, our good and improving gross margins give us increasing leverage within this dynamic. The growth in volume and complexity of semiconductors that propels the test market is stronger than ever. Our Industrial Automation portfolio is well positioned against macro trends and back to high growth. All these dynamics should net out to attractive midterm growth of both sales and earnings.\nWith that, I turn it over to Sanjay for more details. Sanjay?\n\nSanjay Mehta\n\nCFO, VP & Treasurer, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2021. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook and update our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. .\nNow to Q4. Revenues were $885 million, and we delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 31% and EPS of $1.37.Semi Test revenue of $592 million was strong across the board with notable demand for apps processor and RF test in SOC and higher speed flash test in memory. System Test group had revenue of $127 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales in Storage Test and defense and aerospace. LitePoint revenue of $52 million was up over 31% and from the year-ago period on WiFi 6E and early WiFi 7 test demand. Industrial Automation revenue of $113 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of last year on strong demand at both UR and MiR.\nNon-GAAP gross margins were 59.5%, on plan and down quarter-over-quarter due to lower volume and product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million to $253 million from the third quarter due primarily to ongoing industrial automation investments. We generated $302 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 13.6% and on a GAAP basis was 14.75%. For the full year, it was 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 14.75% on a GAAP basis.\nWe ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Regarding debt to date, $343 million of our convertible bond has been redeemed early and repaid. We have a remaining face value of $117 million.\nTurning to the full year results of 2021. The Teradyne revenues of $3.7 billion grew $581 million or 19% year-over-year. $485 million of the growth was from our Test portfolio, while IA delivered $96 million of growth. We had one customer that directly or indirectly drove approximately 19% of our revenue in 2021. Gross margins for the year were 59.6% and operating profit was 33%, up from 57.2% and 30%, respectively, in 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.98, a 29% increase over 2020.We generated $966 million in free cash in 2021 and returned $666 million through share repurchases and dividends.\nLooking more closely at the components of 2021 revenue growth. As Mark outlined, SOC test revenues grew $371 million or 20% on strength in all market segments, but with particular growth in the compute, industrial and automotive markets.\nIn memory, revenues were $396 million, up 3%. NAND test demand drove the growth in 2021.\nIn System Test sales, sales grew for the fifth consecutive year to $468 million, up 14% from 2020. All subsegments of System Test grew in 2021 with Storage Test delivering the largest increase moving from $242 million in 2020 to $288 million in 2021.\nLitePoint is also on an impressive growth path. Sales increased to $217 million, 25% above 2020 and has grown at an 18% CAGR since 2016. Growth drivers included the production ramp of WiFi 6E, WiFi 7 engineering systems and UWB expansion. It's notable that UWB is early in its market penetration, and we expect a long-term growth trajectory as new applications for this technology emerge.\nIn 2021, IA revenue was $376 million, up 34% from 2020's $280 million level. UR grew 41% to $311 million, while MiR grew 42% to $64 million.\nAutoGuide sales were under $2 million in 2021 as we continue to reposition that group for sustainable long-term growth. In 2021, we managed through numerous supply constraints at UR and MiR without a material impact on sales. We expect those constraints to become more severe and expect they may impact the timing of some shipments in the first half of 2022. We've considered that in our guidance.\nNow to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between 700 and 777 -- sales are expected to be between $700 million and $770 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.76 to $0.98 on 175 million diluted shares. First quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and a noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% and 59.5%, first quarter OpEx running at 33% to 36% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 24%.\nLooking at 2022. Our first half 2022 outlook is down from 2021. This will be felt in the first and second quarters with expected Q2 company sales to be about 25% lower than Q2 '21 levels.\nRegarding our OpEx plans for 2022. OpEx growth of 11% to 13% is expected with the majority of the incremental growth in IA. This will likely put our OpEx above model in 2022 before coming back to model in '23. The OpEx investment this year is targeted at R&D to improve ease of use, broaden our robot product lines and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities, all in support of long-term sales and earnings growth.\nTurning to capital expenditures. We expect CapEx to be approximately $160 million. For 2022, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15% based on current tax laws.\nMoving to our earnings model. We expect test and IA growth will drive 2024 company revenue to $4.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $8 at the midpoint of our updated model. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior model and is based on product mix and operating leverage from higher revenue. OpEx as a percent of sales will decline to 26% to 28%, and non-GAAP operating margin expected will be 31% to 34%. The model assumes current tax laws. As shown on the supporting slide, the new model is in line with the trend line performance.\nNow let me provide a little color. With 2021 non-GAAP EPS of $5.98, we've achieved our previous 2024 earnings model 3 years early on the strength of our Test businesses. As we've done in the past, when building our earnings model, we consider the year-on-year demand swings that occur in both Test and IA, but we evaluate our growth on a trend line versus any specific year. Therefore, as in past models, we use the average of 2020 and 2021 revenue as the baseline for our projections. From that baseline, we expect Test revenue to grow at 7% to 11% compounded and IA revenues to grow 32% to 45% through 2024. Both growth rates are significant increases, both in absolute and relative terms from our earlier model.\nIn Semi Test, we expect long-term growth will be driven by the steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with high single-digit semiconductor unit growth. The transition to 3-nanometer and gate all-round technologies will drive complexity growth and higher transistor densities, increased test data collection for process yield learning and longer test times. The complexity point is illustrated by looking at the recent market size trends. When taking an average of 2018 and 2019, the ATE market size was approximately $4 billion. In '21 and '22, the average will be approximately $6 billion. Our earnings model assumes continued growth in the ATE market, and we believe WFE CapEx is a leading indicator of future test demand. This capacity is being put in place to service favorable semiconductor end market trends.\nFirst, the compute market is benefiting from the growth of both x86 and ARM-based solutions in higher-performing solutions at a faster cadence than in the past. The ARM solutions include new hyperscale applications along with AI devices for the data center and edge compute. Second, automotive market has elevated to a higher level. Increases in electric and autonomous driving are pushing the growth and complexity and number of chips per car. Third, the analog industrial end market is expected to continue to operate at a higher level as the digitalization of industry continues to broaden.\nIn IA, we're attacking an attractive and sustainable long-term growth opportunity. The market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots remains below 3%, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand. Our strategy is to drive penetration higher in existing markets and grow the number of new applications in new industry verticals. To enable this strategy, we continue to lean into our OpEx investments. We'll operate the IA business with a target operating margin of 5% to 15%, while we invest to drive growth and reinforce our competitive position. We don't expect the growth rate to moderate in the midterm. But at the point in the future that it does, we'll dial back the OpEx growth and expect operating margins above 20%. In 2022, we expect we'll operate towards the low end of the 5% to 15% range.\nShifting to capital allocation. We'll continue our balanced strategy. This year, we'll increase our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share in 2022.\nRegarding our share repurchases. In 2021, we bought back 4 million shares for $600 million at an average price of $125.74. In 2022, we expect a minimum of $750 million of repurchases, reflecting our confidence in our operating model and the end markets we serve.\nIn summary, 2021 was a record year for sales and earnings. Our global team continued to deliver extraordinary results in a challenging environment. The team's success in balancing customer demand and business needs amidst a constantly changing collection of pandemic-induced constraints was impressive. As we look ahead, long-term growth trends in our end markets remain strong and we've updated our earning model to reflect that outlook. While we expect 2022 will be below the long-term revenue and earnings growth trend lines, we're confident in the long-term trends in our markets and our ability to thrive in them.\nWith that, I'll turn things back to Andy.\n\nAndrew J. Blanchard\n\nVP of Corporate Relations, Teradyne, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Michelle, we'd now like to take some questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you."

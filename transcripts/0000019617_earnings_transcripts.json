Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call.\nThis call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by.\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by noting that this quarter, we are experimenting with shorter prepared remarks. We're streamlining this part of the call to move more quickly to your questions and to minimize the amount of time spent on repeating what you have already seen in the earnings materials.\nSo with that, turning to this quarter's results, the firm reported net income of $14.4 billion and EPS of $5.07 with an ROTCE of 20%. Revenue of $47.1 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking and payments. The increase in NII driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and mix was offset by the impact of lower rates.\nExpenses of $24.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by similar themes as in prior quarters, including higher volume and revenue-related expense. The detailed drivers are in the presentation. And credit costs were $3.4 billion with net charge-offs of $2.6 billion and a net reserve build of $810 million.\nIn Wholesale, charge-offs were slightly elevated as a result of a couple of instances of apparent fraud in certain secured lending facilities. Otherwise, in both Wholesale and Consumer, credit performance remains in line with our expectations.\nAnd in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.8%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. You can see the puts and takes in the presentation. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by increases in wholesale lending across both Banking and Markets as well as other markets activities.\nMoving to our businesses. CCB reported net income of $5 billion. Revenue of $19.5 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, largely incurred on higher revolving balances.\nA few points to highlight. Consumers and small businesses remain resilient based on our data. While we are closely watching the potentially softening labor market, our credit metrics, including early-stage delinquencies remain stable and slightly better than expected. We retained our #1 position in retail deposit share in a relatively flat deposit market based on FDIC data, marking our fifth consecutive year leading the industry.\nAnd in light of the attention our Sapphire refresh has received, we want to note that this has already been the best year ever for new account acquisitions for our Sapphire portfolio. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion. Revenue of $19.9 billion was up 17% year-on-year, driven by higher revenues across markets, payments, investment banking and security services.\nTo give a bit more color, IB fees were up 16% year-on-year, reflecting a pickup in activity across products with particular strength in equity underwriting as the IPO market was active. Our pipeline remains robust and the outlook, along with the market backdrop and client sentiment continues to be upbeat.\nIn Markets, fixed income was up 21% year-on-year with higher revenues in rates and credit as well as strong performance in securitized products. Equities was up 33% from robust client activity across the franchise with notable outperformance in prime.\nTurning to Asset & Wealth Management. AWM reported net income of $1.7 billion with pretax margin of 36%. Record revenue of $6.1 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees due to strong net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity.\nLong-term net inflows were $72 billion for the quarter, led by fixed income and equities. AUM of $4.6 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.8 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And before turning to the outlook, Corporate reported net income of $825 million and revenue of $1.7 billion.\nIn terms of the outlook, since we've already reported 3 quarters of results, I'm going to update the full year guidance in terms of the fourth quarter. And in addition to that, we've done the implied full year math on the page, so you can easily compare it to previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter NII ex Markets to be approximately $23.5 billion and fourth quarter total NII to be about $25 billion. We expect fourth quarter adjusted expense to be approximately $24.5 billion, implying $95.9 billion for the full year with the increase driven by the stronger revenue environment. And on credit, we now expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.3% on favorable delinquency trends driven by the continued resilience of the consumer.\nIn keeping with our focus on the fourth quarter and recognizing that you'll likely annualize the fourth quarter NII and ask us questions about 2026, we're providing the central case for NII ex Markets in 2026, which is about $95 billion. Note that this is a preliminary view subject to the usual caveats as well as the fact that we have not finished the annual budget cycle yet. And for expenses, completing the budget cycle will be even more important, which is why we are not providing an update today. While you probably haven't spent a lot of time refining your 2026 estimates yet, it is worth saying that when we look at the fourth quarter and adjust for seasonality and expected labor inflation as well as adding some growth, the consensus of about $100 billion does look a little bit low.\nWe will formally provide the 2026 outlook for NII, expense and card NCO rate at the fourth quarter earnings, and we'll have another opportunity to discuss the outlook at our recently announced company update in February. We're now happy to take your questions. So let's open the line for Q&A.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you very much, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, the firm reported net income of $15 billion, EPS of $5.24, and revenue of $45.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included an income tax benefit of $774 million, which we describe in more detail in the earnings press release. On the next page, we have some more detail. The firm reported revenue of $45.7 billion, down $5.3 billion, or 10% year-over-year. NII ex-markets was down $185 million, or 1%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposits, higher revolving balances, and card, as well as the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters.\nNII markets was down $6.3 billion, or 31%, and excluding the net gain related to Visa shares and net investment securities losses in the prior year, was up $1 billion, or 8%, driven by higher asset management fees, higher auto lease income, higher investment banking fees, and higher payments fees. Markets revenue was up $1.1 billion, or 15%. Expenses of $23.8 billion were up $66 million, and excluding last year's Visa stock contribution to the firm's foundation, was up $1.1 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by compensation, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.8 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve build of $439 million. The build was driven by new lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the probabilities that we attached to the adverse scenarios in the allowance estimation.\nOnto the balance sheet on page three. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, down 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net income was more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by an increase in wholesale lending across both CIB markets and banking, an increase in other markets activity, as well as an increase in card loans. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago, and the current rules are indicative, SCB is floored at 2.5% and goes into effect in 2025. Our new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.50 per share in the third quarter. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $18.8 billion, which was up 6% year-on-year.\nIn banking and wealth management, revenue was up 3%, largely driven by growth in wealth management revenue, with deposit NII relatively flat. Average deposits were down 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Find investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, driven by market performance and continued healthy flows into managed products. In home lending, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower NII. Turning to card services and auto, revenue was up 15% year-on-year, predominantly driven by card NII on higher revolving balances, as well as higher operating lease income in auto. Card outstandings were up 9% due to strong account acquisition. In auto, originations were up 5%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 5% year-on-year, largely driven by growth in technology and auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, relatively flat year-on-year, in line with expectations.\nNext, the commercial and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $6.7 billion on revenue of $19.5 billion, which was up 9% year-on-year. IB fees were up 7% year-on-year, and we continue to rank number one with a wallet share of 8.9%. In advisory, fees were up 8%, benefiting from increased sponsor activity. Debt underwriting fees were up 12%, primarily driven by a few large deals. In equity underwriting, fees were down 6% year-on-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and the outlook, along with the market tone and sentiment, is notably more upbeat. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher losses on hedges. Moving to markets, total revenue was up 15% year-on-year.\nFixed income was up 14%, with improved performance in currencies and emerging markets, rates, and commodities. This was partially offset by fewer opportunities in securitized products and fixed income financing. Equities was up 15%. We continue to see strong performance across products, most notably in derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 12% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, brokerage, and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and up 2% quarter on quarter, with sequential growth primarily driven by new loans with larger corporates. Average client deposits were up 16% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across payments and Securities Services.\nFinally, credit costs were $696 million, driven by builds in our CNI portfolio, including new lending activity and downgrades to a handful of names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment I mentioned upfront. Turning to asset and wealth management to complete our lines of business, AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter, led by fixed income and equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion.\nAUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate, Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gains. Expenses of $547 million were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the foundation contributions in the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook.\nYou'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook, so now let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex-markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in payments, security services, and balance growth in card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom-line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic, in many ways, navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients.\nWe're now happy to take your questions, so let's open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from Christopher McGrady with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher McGrady\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jamie, relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nChristopher McGrady\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks for having me.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nJust wanted to welcome you to the call before we get started.\n\nChristopher McGrady\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Relative to three months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to. And secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital, what do you need to see from the macro or regulatory, and how should we be thinking about the timing? Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLet me take the second part of that first. So we have our standard capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I don't want to bore you by reciting it again, but I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend, and with what's left, we do buybacks. And so we've talked about how excess capital's earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having the organic capital generation be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in our RWA expansion.\nSo we're doing what we want to do, but clearly, it is a big amount of excess, and that does mean that everything is on the table, as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now, obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically, and importantly, in some cases, culturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes we lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it.\nI don't particularly think, other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now particularly shapes our thinking on that front.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI'd appreciate just a broader point about regulations. I think it is very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one thing. Nothing's happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. If you look at SLR, GCP, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent, and safer. The things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things, and you can create more liquidity, more loans, and a safer system. That's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. So I'm hoping that over time they do that.\nAnd the secondary to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, \"What do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, etc.?\" We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago, to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit's growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happening? Is that a good thing for America? And so it is time that they take a step back. I hear sometimes from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations. Absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years.\nThey should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, \"How can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. And maybe you've sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there, I will note that Vice Chair Bowman gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work and regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie's saying in terms of the to-do list. I think at the margin, we do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly need to be addressed, like SLR. But at the same time that that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, etc., is clearly quite important.\nMore narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that of all the things that are out there, one of the worst is GSIB in the sense of both the original gold plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit under-discussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strong disincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that seems to me the exact opposite of what we want. So that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say.\n\nChristopher McGrady\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nI appreciate all the color. If I could ask on a follow-up, the inorganic comments, I'm interested in capital allocation between your businesses, where you think if that were to present an opportunity, which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI mean, we've talked about that a little bit over time. Obviously, we're not fundamentally capital constrained right now. So I mean, in addition to the fact that capital isn't the only financial resource that we need to allocate, I would say the larger point is that any good franchise business that makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done within reason, subject to obvious caveats. So.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nInorganic, it's a good discipline to always be looking. I wouldn't have high expectations. That would be how I use a lot of capital. I think it's a very big plus that we grow organically in every business we're in without having to stretch.\n\nChristopher McGrady\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. So two questions. First, on the RWA utilization via organic, as you described, I wanted to understand in wholesale lending where you highlighted the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit? Is it M&A financing? Is it inventory? What are you seeing in the market here that you're delivering on that's raising that lending profile?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nIt's all of the above, Betsy, because we are the Swiss Army knife end of financing. We do everything, and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Oh, great. All right. Thank you. And then, Jamie, there's been a lot of discussion around stablecoin, how stablecoin is going to be impacting banks. And I believe you have an opinion on this. Would love to hear if you could highlight how JPM is thinking about utilizing, leveraging, competing with stablecoin, and how the JPM Coin deposit token feeds into all of this as well. Thank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSo a deposit token is effectively the same thing. You're moving money by token. You could pay interest. It's JPMorgan deposit. And stablecoins, we're going to be involved in both JPM Coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it. We don't know exactly how it's going to end up. I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just a payment. But I do think you have fintech. These guys are very smart. They're trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts and get into payment systems, and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. And the way to be cognizant is to be involved. So we're going to be in it, learning a lot, and a player.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Super. And then separately on the topic of open banking, I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period give you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThis is very important. If we get pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. We think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, do they actually know it's being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn't be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. We're in favor of all that done properly. Then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the systems, protection. We just think it should be done and done right. That's the main part. It's not like you can't do it.\nThe last thing is a liability shift. I mean, I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market it and do a whole bunch of stuff with it, and then you get scammed or fraud through them. They should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that. And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that. There should be a little more responsibility on their part so we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Okay. Thank you so much for that.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Betsy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Stephen Alexopoulos from TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start, Jeremy, going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital. So when I look at the company, so you're the largest US bank by assets. You're also the largest in terms of the data you see every day. And you may or may not have seen that Apple's looking at possibly their Siri getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as a Perplexity. And just thinking out loud here, would it make sense for JPMorgan to consider acquiring an LLM? Right? The last two quarters of buybacks are about the last valuation round for Perplexity. Right? I'm thinking of you guys. You could become the LLM for the financial services industry. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWe use LLMs, and we're going to be agnostic about that too. There's no reason for us to own one. At least we can't figure out why that would make sense.\nYeah. And I wouldn't.\nWe will use it, and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. And on the question of inorganic deployment, I would sort of blend my comments with Jamie's. Right? In the end, I'm just asserting that, of course, we need to look at inorganic opportunities. And of course, that's a question that comes up given our current excess capital position. But Jamie said clearly that he doesn't think that's particularly likely for some of the reasons that you emphasize. It's not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWe do a lot of small ones, by the way, which you've seen.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Yeah. Okay. Then going back, Jamie, to your answer to Betsy's question on the tokenized deposit, I get it how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden, but it doesn't help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden. What's holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint, similar somewhat to what you've done with Zelle, and prevent these stablecoin companies like Circle coming in, offering a more convenient solution to your customers?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThat's a great question, and we'll leave it remaining as a question.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nWithout an answer?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWell, you're raising a very important point about interoperability of stablecoins, deposits, and movement of money and what problem you're trying to solve. But you're raising a great point. So you can assume we're thinking about all that.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nGood morning. This almost sounds like a fintech, an AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release give us a sense when we think about middle market businesses in the US, what's the state of play there when we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing? Should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out six, nine, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that you all look at?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYou can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We built, I think, 500 banks in the innovation economy. It's kind of new to us. Think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next six to nine months.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nGot it. I guess just as a follow-on.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nGo ahead, Jeremy. Yep.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNo, no. Go ahead. Ask your follow-up.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nI was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play, the health of the balance sheets of these customers, and also if you can expand that into the consumer, any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you are beginning to get more concerned today versus three or six months ago?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Right. Okay. Because that's what I was going to try to clarify. I just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer, wholesale, or both. So let's do consumer quickly. I think we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. The consumer basically seems to be fine. Now, a few things are true. If you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower-income bands than you see in the higher-income bands. But that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our net charge-off guidance unchanged.\nAll of that looks kind of fine. To be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the edges, consumer credit is primarily about labor markets. In a world with a 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio, to see a lot of weakness. Now, it is true that if you look at not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day. First half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now, it's still positive. It's still growing, but it's down. It's kind of consistent, this sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing.\nOur own data, looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period. So it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nThat was helpful. And would you say the same about commercial?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI mean, basically, yes. You see some idiosyncratic things here and there. And on the point of tariffs, I guess, obviously, you recall the slide that we did on investor day kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins, their sensitivity to input cost, their amount of pricing power, the amount of leverage, and where the rules actually land. But people are obviously getting some time to adjust, and we're watching it very closely. So we'll see.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nThat's all. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi. Good morning. Jeremy, quick follow-up on the consumer credit. Broader comments taken there. But in terms of the NPAs, the non-accruals and consumers seem to have a bit of a jump. Is there something technical there? Maybe just talk to that.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Thanks for that, John. I'm glad to get a chance to clarify this. There is something technical, which has to do with customers in the home lending customers in the LA area using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires. So that is resulting in an uptick in the non-performing. But when you think about land value and the insurance there, the actual loss expectation is de minimis, I would say. So.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWe always do that for customers when they have a real difficult time.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nExactly. So that's what's driving that one.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Great. And wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits, maybe in the context of Marianne Lake's presentation from investor day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid to upper single-digit deposit growth that Marianne Lake talked about?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Sure. I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. That's a nice number. As you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step by step. You start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. A thing that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield-seeking flows. With the yield-seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us or increasingly behind us.\nAnd you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts and consumer checking this quarter. And that's one of the key drivers. And then, as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth, macro environment, etc., that's how you get to that type of 6% number. Now, obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates, which perhaps somewhat non-intuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield-seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate.\nBut the flip side of that is also true, which is an unexpectedly high-rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal in consumer. So we like to say those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Great. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks a lot, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography? And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise. And we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the corporate sector in some sense. And people like to look at it as a rate across for the smaller banks, etc. That part of the franchise remains fine but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets, and revolving utilization is sort of flattish in general. But as I noted, I think previously, and as you see coming through the IBP performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public.\nSome of that is on our balance sheet, and we're very happy to have it there.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nAnd to answer your other question, Mike, so some of them, I'm going to go over and give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. So GSIF, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at a bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to the window and things like that. CCAR, in some cases, we talk about CCARness, but there's a lot of CCARness from small business loans and stuff like that where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR Capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book.\nAnd so when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility, and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, etc. And the reducing the risk in the system, I think it also makes it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at total loans to deposits, they used to be 100%. They're now 70%. Okay? And that's a huge difference. That took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYou didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Yes. And I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market. And all these things could reduce the actual cost of making a loan. I've pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination, and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we just have failed to do it for 10 years. And it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd last one, when you say inorganic growth, would you buy a private credit firm? Is that something you'd at least consider?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI would say it's not high on my list because we can do it ourselves, and buying people and comp plans. I also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit. I don't know that, but we already do it. So if it was the right people, the right price, the right fit, we should look at it. I think, Mike, you should always be open-minded when people come to you with something you hadn't thought about before. You just get smarter by looking at these things.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nActually, I can't leave on that comment.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWhat?\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nPeak private credit, I can't leave on those three words. What do you mean by peak private credit?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nWell, I've mentioned that credit spread is very low. It's grown dramatically over time. You have to pay up a lot for it. I'm not saying it's not going to grow some more, but I would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was. But your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us, natural fit being product, people, and culture.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSorry, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNo, I was literally going to say what Jamie just said. So we're good.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning. Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. It seems like, based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame, and GSIB, which impacts you so much. To that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital, and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talk about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nIn a competitive world, it is irrational to think that, and when it applies to all the competitors, that everyone's just going to make a lot more money and keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, etc. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Exactly. As we always say, Erika, right, the market's very competitive and the returns are high. You know this, but I would just refer you to the slide that I delivered at investor day about how, in some cases, it makes all else equal compared to buying back shares at these prices. Doing healthy, well-underwritten, compelling franchise business with a 14% return, we're definitely supposed to do that, actually. If we do a lot of that, it will dilute down the weighted average ROTC of the company in ways that are nonetheless clearly accretive to shareholders.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nJeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. I think you should do the lower return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff. If you didn't do it, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns that we deploy capital by adding bankers, branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches. That does our private banking or things like that.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYep. For sure. And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTC improvement. And the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly we saw it in the numbers, a leap in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering, as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, did activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty? I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients' thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSo, Jeremy, you might want to. I'll just answer the question by saying, honestly, we don't know. You've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. So that lesson, we've learned over and over, and it may stay wide open for a year and a half. Something may happen geopolitically that, all of a sudden, that pipeline slows a little bit. So I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yeah, you're going to have really active markets.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. And my version of that, Erika, would be to say that you talked about certain of the tail risks getting taken completely off the table. And that's clearly not true, right? All the tail risks are all still there quite prominently and, in many cases, in the daily news flow. Maybe at the margin, the tails are a little bit less fat right now. I think it's also true that in terms of the things that we've said about our investment banking pipeline have been consistently quite cautious. And at a certain point, when you have the type of outperformance that you have this quarter, it starts to make your cautiousness seem less credible. So we wanted to take a hard look at ourselves and say, \"What do we really think?\" And it's like, yeah, the sentiment is better.\nBut as Jamie says, that can change overnight, and there are a lot of risks out there.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI do think that extending the tax bill for businesses to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done. I also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial liberation day. Now there's more talk, there's more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed. That reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before 1 August.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just on Jeremy, if I look at your 10-Q and 10-K rate sensitivity disclosures, it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve. So can you talk about what you've been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet, whether extending duration or hedges? And is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as, I guess, the markets expect later this year? Thanks.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. Before he goes on, the market expectation is almost never what happens.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nFair enough.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nAll right. So it's a good question, Jim. But yeah, as Jamie points out, just remember that the extent that the market is efficient, which maybe it's not, but you can't really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in, right? So that's what I'm saying out loud. But I mean, you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later.\nBut having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did, in fact, add some duration this quarter with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve, which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary-type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes in higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII. As we've talked about a little bit over time, though, I like the way you framed it in terms of having the capacity.\nI think the way to think about it there is that, in general, it's almost impossible to get your assets for a bank like us. It's almost impossible to get your asset sensitivity, your actual asset sensitivity down to zero because you wind up constrained by other things. We're in the quarter, and we're okay with where we are right now.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks. Maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators look at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheets into lower-risk assets. Do you see that? Is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand-supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower margin areas. Just your thoughts.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. It's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at investor day. So I'll more or less repeat my answer here, which is that, as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding, and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want for these backstop measures. And so we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections mid-crisis. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed.\nBut it's a good sign that it's now out there. And we certainly support the proposal. There are some nuances that are common have been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal. It's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yeah, as you know, and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it.\nThere are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity, which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low-risk intermediation in the market-making businesses, which is maybe where you would hope to see the effect. So it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point. So I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of its eventually being finalized because I think everyone's assuming it'll go in roughly in its current form.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI'm like a broken record. It's not SLR. It's LCR. It's GSIFE. It's CCAR. It's Basel IV. It's the gold plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, etc., and even how you measure liquidity, which is different in one measure than it is in resolution and recovery. They should look at all of that if they really want to fix the system.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nRight. Thanks for the color.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ken Usdin from Autonomous. You may proceed.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous\n\nThanks. Good morning. First question is, I just wanted to ask you about the recent Sapphire price changes and just what you're seeing in terms of initial response, and just how that fits in strategically with the competitive landscape on card and your growth opportunity.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, sure. So let me just answer the question of how it's going for us.\nSo far, going fine. We're happy. In terms of the strategic aspects of this and the competitive landscape, I think the way we think about this is as a normal course refresh of one of our important products and the way that all of our products get refreshed periodically. Obviously, this is a relatively high-profile product. Many of us have the card. We see the ads everywhere. So it sort of punches above its weight in that respect in terms of visibility. In terms of the competitive landscape, I think a thing that we feel really great about is the dramatic increase in the customer value proposition associated with the card. And in particular, one of the things that we look at is the ratio of the customer value to the annual fee, which is clearly market-leading at this point. So.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI've got a lot of comments that people from friends of my kids and stuff like that that, \"Man, you've already raised the bar, but they have to keep it for the LaGuardia lounge.\" That's the value added.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nAnd then some. There's a lot of value added.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nAnd then some, yes. Exactly.",
    "content2": "Jeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, yeah. So, yeah. Obviously, I mean, we're not going to talk too much about competitors, but as you know, the card space is very competitive and very dynamic. So we exist in a competitive landscape, and this is our best foot forward on this product at this moment in time.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous\n\nGot it. It is quite a nice lounge. On the trading side, just wondering how much the strong results this quarter changed a lot from April to June? And I'm just wondering how much you think that was environmental? Has it calmed down at all? And also, how much is just your ability to kind of use the balance sheet to boost results also? Could that make it more sustainable regardless of what the environment is doing? Thanks a lot.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nGood question. Honestly, I think it's kind of all of the above, basically. No question that the tone shifted. Obviously, it shifted in investment banking. I think I personally was a little bit surprised by the resilience of the market's revenues in the second half of the quarter because I was sort of expecting a little bit of an offset between the two.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI was not surprised.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOkay. There you have it. It's not like I thought it would do badly, but it sort of did quite well in the volatility in the first half of the quarter, and then it got quiet. Despite that, we still did nicely. I think the point, actually, sort of to your question is that, yes, we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources. Yeah, maybe at the margin, that does contribute a little bit to durability. We've talked over time about the market's revenues and the dramatic increase. I mean, obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we should expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway. We worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate. Then we kind of stopped worrying about that.\nAnd now, of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But a thing I like to remind myself of, to your point, is that while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So we are deploying a lot of capital and other resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it, but the revenue growth is not coming for free. So it's us running the place, basically.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Some regional banks have come out to commercial.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nMatt, you've got some major stats on the line. I don't know if we're going to be able to hear you. Give it a shot. Give it a shot.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch\n\nCan you hear me better now?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNot really, but let's try. Let's try.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI just wanted to ask about any pressure from commercial and corporate customers to try to offset the tariff impact from regional banks attempting to put deposit pricing pressure on the commercial side, and if you're seeing any signs of that or, more broadly speaking. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI think if I heard the question correctly, you were asking.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYou were saying tariff pressure, with pressure on loans or deposits. The answer is no.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThe answer is no, yeah.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI wish we could say more, but we think the answer is no.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNo, I mean, there's always pressure in some of those things.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI mean, it's a competitive market, right? Deposits are very, very competitive, and there are always pricing conversations, as there should be. It's hard to know in any given moment what's driving it, but I haven't heard anything to support the tariff-linked narrative.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. Just two quick follow-ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines, I know we've been here before, and markets can give it and take it away, but there is a time value in there, meaning corporates and, more importantly, sponsors need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now. Does it feel more doable as long as the market doesn't take the rug out from under us?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI think the separate sponsor-owned companies from IPOs, they're companies going public. They're in the pipeline. They want to go public, etc. Sponsors are still, at least from what I can tell, anecdotally, still reluctant to use the public markets. There may obviously be maybe more of it, but it hasn't been a mountain of stuff coming out.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I think that's right in the IPO space, at least for now. But I have heard some things to support some elements of your narrative plan, to the effect of that there is pressure to kind of recycle capital and get things done. And yeah, sure. After the initial shock of the tariff policy changes, everyone kind of went on hold. But as we've noted in our comments a few times today, at a certain moment, you just have to move on with life. And it does feel like some of that is happening just because you can't delay forever.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nI hear you. The follow-up on the capital conversation, obviously impressive to see big returns on even higher capital bases. But there's more to come. And I think trend is your friend on DREG. So the question is, you keep making a lot of money. Your capital base keeps rising. You've talked about arresting the growth of CET1 in the past, but I guess my blunt question is, is there any valuation limitation towards that arresting of CET1?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOkay. Wait. I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital, which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happened this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage, which we were frankly very happy to see, in fact. So that's all to the good in some sense. Now, the other part of your question, can you just repeat it? I want to make sure I understand it.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nI'm just curious if there's a valuation limitation to the thinking, meaning as valuation goes up, are you just going to keep buying back?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSo, meaning, would we go back to a moment of reducing buybacks and starting to build again if the stock gets even more expensive? I mean, I think that's the question for the boss, but I don't know. I guess we always reserve the right to do whatever we want on buybacks, basically.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. We reserve the right. We're not going to tell you. But obviously, it's pricing. I mean, I don't like buying back the stock at almost three times tangible book. No one's going to convince me that's a brilliant thing to do, but it is wise to use our balance sheet for customers, which we're doing, and we can maybe possibly do more. And it is probably wise to not increase the excess capital anymore since we have plenty, and it's going to be going up. But look, I'm completely convinced if you take out of your mindset 12 months, we will use the capital wisely for shareholders.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAlways do. All right. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Glenn.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThe best way is organic growth, which I wouldn't rule out that we can find more ways to grow clients, basically.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the one-time effect. You go back to your investor day, and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. If we turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance excuse me, guidance was 11.5%-12%.\nSo my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business, or are there some one-time, not one-time, items, but are there some tailwinds that are artificially, I hate to use that word, but are they inflating the ROTCE, which is why you guys are very cautious about lifting that goal from 17%?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nJeremy, you can answer this. This might really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we can not just earn 70% ROTC, is that we can reinvest money as 70% ROTC. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17%, you're a bond. Then you will trade it three times tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers and internationally. And when you look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe, it's been great. The innovation economy has been great. We're gaining shares in a lot of places.\nChase Wealth Management and the private bank, the international private payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. Forget the timetable of that. That is the best way to use it.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. And Gerard, I guess on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable, and I feel like it's kind of all of the above. And let me say what I mean. On the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right? Rates are at a good level for us. Deal activity is high. Capital markets are very strong. Consumer credit is excellent. Wholesale credit is excellent. Wealth management, asset management. I mean, essentially, every part of the company is firing. We're essentially firing on all cylinders with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate-sensitive, like home lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market.\nSo when you see that, you're like, \"Well, that's not normal.\" Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse, and that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well. We've been investing for a long time, very successfully, and kind of leaning in even in moments where, from the outside, there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie's talking about. Some of those investments in various ways are paying off.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI appreciate that. You have all of our major bank competitors who are back and growing and expanding. You have the fintech folks who are quite capable and quite smart who want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion that somehow we're not going to deal with competitors, which protects JPMorgan Chase if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic, and we keep on realizing you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day. And so we're quite cautious to just declare victory like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever. I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, actually, I had Jeremy do this number one point.\nIf you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America for 40 years, maybe.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I always have to go put new batteries in my HP-12C when you ask me that question. All right. Yeah. I think we're good.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJeremy, I'm glad you're still using HP12C. That's good. Just as a follow-up.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHe just uses his big brain. He doesn't need the 12C.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAs a quick follow-up, Jeremy, you touched on.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nDon't do 72 to the 40. It's not true because we don't know. Can we not do that?\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJust as a quick follow-up, Jeremy, in the markets comment that you made, you said that there were fewer opportunities in securitized products and fixed-income financing. Can you expand upon that or give us any color there? Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, sure. I mean, it's just normal diversification inside the markets business. Those businesses are doing great, but at the margin in the second half of the quarter, that stuff was a little quieter relative to emerging markets and the macro space, which was a little bit better.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNothing too dramatic.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question, it comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. I just want to follow up on Ken's question about sales and trading. I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy, but you had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1, on the back of a really strong 2024. I mean, how are you thinking about how much of this is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable and presumably less volatility, good for investment banking? But would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result, or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share? I'm just curious how you think about what's exceptional versus what's more durable here.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I mean, one thing I'll say is that there's no weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter driving the results. So it's pretty broad-based, and it's not particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways, including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like GSIP capacity and liquidity in some cases to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns, but it's sort of it's not just like growing without any inputs, essentially. So I guess on the one hand, you might say that that's a bit more durable for that reason, but it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources, essentially.\nSo I mean, we've gotten over time a little bit more relaxed about talking about the markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues. It's obviously extremely client-centric. There's a lot of financing of various types that's being supplied, and it seems to, if anything, more often than not be countercyclical rather than procyclical. But it's still markets, right? Things can happen. It's volatile. There's risk-taking involved. That's part of the point that we built. Sorry to hedge the answer, but that's kind of how we think about it.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nThat's fine. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nYeah. Good morning, and thanks. Kind of an old-school bank analyst question. After a long time of kind of bemoaning slow C&I loan growth, you had this extraordinary growth this quarter, $33 billion in average and more than 6% quarter over quarter. But then when we look at the P&L in the commercial and investment bank, net interest income is down 2% and lending income is down 4%. And I know there's hedges and other complicated things, but it just kind of doesn't compute that you'd have such strong loan growth and not have revenue growth associated with that.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I mean, the hedges are definitely part of it, and a lot of the assets came on the balance sheet quite late in the quarter. So I don't know. I might be missing something.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSome isn't.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOh, and there's probably some markets.\nAnd markets, and the markets, and AI piece of it too. So I don't know. Michael can follow up with you, but I think the loan thing is part of it, markets and AI is part of it, and late quarter balance sheet. And the hedges for sure. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nChris Kotowski\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. All righty. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have no further questions.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks very much.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day."

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2025 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and the Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.071 on revenue of $46 billion with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic Bank related gain of $588 million which was previously disclosed in the 10-K on page two. We have more on our Q1 results. The firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion or 8% year on NII ex-Markets was down $430 million or 2%. Growth driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances and CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher card revolving balances.\nThe impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters as well as higher wholesale deposits and NIR ex-Markets, was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and, excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses, and higher investment banking fees and Markets. Revenue was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual, compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million.\nWe have more details on the reserve build on page three. With this quarter's reserve build, the firm's total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several weeks. Our Q1 allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the quarter. But in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance.\nSo with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted average macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality, changes on certain exposures, and net lending activity, as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not to any meaningful degree driven by deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. As net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.\nThis quarter, the firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to a $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page five. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment. Based on our data, spend cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year on year.\nIn banking and wealth management, revenue was down 1% year on year driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year on year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter on quarter. Client investment assets were up 7% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In home lending, revenue was up 2% year on year and originations were up 42% year on year off a small base in a slowly growing market.\nTurning to card services and auto, revenue was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by card NII on higher revolving balances as well as higher operating lease income in auto. Card outstandings were up 10% due to strong account acquisition, and in auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing, technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year on year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in card, with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in card.\nNext, the Corporate and Investment Bank on page 6, CIB, reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which is up 12% year on year. IB fees were up 12% year on year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. IB advisory fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Debt underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in leveraged finance. Equity underwriting fees were down 9% year on year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the investment banking outlook. While client engagement and dialogue is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of uncertainty premiums.\nRevenue was up 3% year on year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances moving to Markets. Total revenue was up 21% year on year, reflecting record performance in equities. Fixed income was up 8% with better performance in rates and commodities against a relatively weak prior year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility, slightly supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in derivatives. Security Services revenue was up 7% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 9.8 billion were up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal, and brokerage expense.\nAverage banking and payments loans were down 3% year on year and down 1% sequentially as we continue to observe payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year on year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across payments and Security Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page seven, AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances.\nExpenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by equity and fixed income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. Finally, loans were up 5% year on year and flat quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 7% year on year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year on year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year on year.\nNIR was a net gain of $653 million, compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. Current quarter included the significant item I mentioned up front. While the prior year quarter included net securities losses of $336 million, expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year on year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned up front.\nTo finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex-Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The firm-wide NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit we expect the card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%.\nSo to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. But of course the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the Markets, and the broader economy. And we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP\n\nGood morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on and given the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in some of your growth and reserving expectations? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSure, Ken. So, I mean, at a high level I would say that obviously some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So you know, we've done some soundings and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, you know, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main thing that we see there is what would appear to be a certain amount of front loading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, you know, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions.\nYou know, in terms of our corporate clients, obviously they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy, and at the margin that shifts their focus away from, you know, more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the investment banking pipeline outlook towards, you know, more short term work optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize what we're hearing from our, from our corporate clients as, you know, a little bit of a wait and see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across sectors.\nSome sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business, and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now, but certainly a bit of a wait and see attitude. It's hard to make long-term decisions right now, and so we'll see what. See how that plays out.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP\n\nYeah. And one question on the NII ex-Markets holding at 90%, can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day, and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think today's curve has something like three cuts. And so. We've talked a lot obviously about how we're asset sensitive. You now see our EAR disclosed in the supplement, and probably our empirical EAR is a little bit higher than our modeled EAR as a result of the relatively lower than modeled rates paid in consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted average IORB, which is about 22 basis points, should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex-Markets.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, that's just mechanically guaranteed not to.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAs Ken said. So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer to that is that across all the puts and takes, actually our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit balances, for example; we see beta outperforming in a couple different places in CDs and in wholesale.\nThe other thing is that you'll recall we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the card late fee rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get unchanged, even though clearly, all else equal, the lower expected front end rates are a headwind.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence, but Jeremy also mentioned that banking should be, the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always seems to think about the banks as, you know, weaker players given how they trade the stocks, more on sentiment and fear rather than the mass of the ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward if we do fall into a slower, slower economic time. So I guess just the question here is can you double click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe double click on Jeremy's statement that banking, the banking system should be a source of strength.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBefore Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about, you know, bank equity performance, the extent to which banks are cyclical or not, like, obviously, a recessionary environment. As I frequently said, all else equal is bad for banks from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks, balance sheets, and our ability to support our clients in a difficult moment.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nEveryone trades stocks in a different way. But banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit loss will go up, volumes can change, yield curves can change. We're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist Michael Feroli. I called him this morning specifically to ask them how they look at their forecast today.\nThey think it's about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change too. I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys, not you. But the analyst community reduces earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and -5% probably the next month. And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is.\nMy guess is a lot; we'll remove it. They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A. That's M&A with middle market companies. That's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new environment, and I think, you know, you will see what it is. I just also want to point out, just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable.\nWhen COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months. We had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. Then to show you how stupid CECL is, in a three-quarter period we took down the $15 billion. That just sizes up a bad recession. If it's a mild recession, it'll be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it'll be more than that. Either way we can handle it and serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. A second follow-up question, and I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking about resilience. To that point, the second question is on the reserve. You know, Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from here and what you're going, obviously, [with the] deterioration outlook? But what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions about further builds from here?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, Erika, it's a good question, but. The truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to give an outlook for reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do. Anyway, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks.The consensus forecast at the end of the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there were some big pending announcements and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information.\nAnd so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build. We use this weighted average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously the actual mechanisms are quite complex. The depth of any potential recession, the timing of it, the distribution of outcomes, which sectors it hits. Idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot, I think, on consumers. Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment.\nSo, you know, if the labor market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question.\nI apologize. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning, Jeremy. On that same topic, no change to the full year credit card net charge off forecast. How do we square that with the rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for next year or just too early to call?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nWe should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. I would say that's a short term number and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, that's what we're kind of thinking.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nMechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way charge-off works. That means that it's pretty baked pretty far out in time.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nA couple of quarters. Yeah.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSo sort of echoing Jamie's point, you know, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year. Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, got it. And then, just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or does this kind of change it?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe investment that we do in banks, branches, technology is going to continue regardless of the environment. Then we have, you know, depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIB and all that $30 to 60 billion of excess capital. In the Chairman's Letter I wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having the excess capital. We are prepared for any environment and that's so we can serve clients, that's not, you know, for any other reason. We have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get through whatever the stormy seas are.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n\nJust wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend? There's been headlines of travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year over year.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, it's a good question. We're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean, we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds for them specifically in airline travel. And we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front loading of spending specifically in items that might, you know, have prices go up as a function of tariffs.\nSo you see people behaving rationally. And I have noted even, you know, you hear anecdotes and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising. You know, we have pre tariff inventory and so on and so forth. It's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of interested in in the space is like what's happening by income band. Because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. I think when we look at our card data, and also our cash buffers, and people's checking accounts, of course it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment.\nBut when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the average cash buffers are lower, and you see some rotation of spend, and spending is at least a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. No evidence of distress, I would say.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Color. Then just separately, if we look. At the delinquencies for the Home Lending, they increase both QQ and year over year. Is that just some of the noise? From the First Republic deal as you. Take the marks up front, and then those portfolios essentially reseason from an accounting point of view, or is there something else going on there?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSorry, that I actually didn't hear which fees,\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n\ndelinquencies in Home Lending.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI didn't. Interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that. I don't think there's anything. Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised. So it could be the First Republic accounting. Yes. Yeah, anything is possible. We'll get back to you on that.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But given the geopolitical concerns weakening global demand for Treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing US Treasuries if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the firm just in light of some of the recent volatility?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, so SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. You really need reform across SLR, G-SIB, CCAR, Basel III, and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks, it's relief to the Markets. JPMorgan will be fine without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks, the big market makers, can intermediate more in the Markets. If they do, spreads will come in, they'll be more active traders.\nIf they don't, the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the Markets, the Fed has to come in and intermediate. So they should make these changes. The reason why is when you have a lot of volatile Markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in Treasuries, it affects all other capital Markets. That's the reason to do it not as a favor to the banks themselves, but. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this in any way, shape, or form. It's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the Markets help clients do what they have to do.\nAnd if they, you know, the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no, you know, basically take not much more interest rate exposure. I should say our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSteve, all I would add to that is that, you know, it is of course true and we all remember the moment, you know, a few years ago when you know, intermediaries were in fact bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. We've seen when it is binding and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed.\nI think our point is a little bit, as Jamie said in his Chairman's Letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed and there are interactions among all these things and we as a bank are not particularly bound by it. There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets put in. So that'll be an interesting thing to watch.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nThank you both for that perspective. Just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. Admittedly, less surprising to hear some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. Was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have been performing extraordinarily well of late, and just given the combination of elevated volatility but also some indications that clients are taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYes, it's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile environment. If Markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been, of course it's not guaranteed.\nWe need to do a good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients. But you know, we were certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nThat's great. Thank you both for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you. Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us? If you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where customers may reintermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI mean, it's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of, your question aligns with what we've been saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche direct lending type structure, we're open for business for all of it.\nI would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source, the banking system being a source of strength in this environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past, and that we have the underwriting capability, the capital, the liquidity, and the experience to be, you know, reliable lenders and serving our clients no matter what type of environment we're in. So if that means that we have an opportunity to, you know, compete incrementally even more effectively in this environment, that that'll be great.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nVery good. Thank you. And as a follow up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads, that there will be a better chance of real regulatory reform? They see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, I mean Gerard, we always say this and it's true, which is that, you know, we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively as possible to, you know, express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system, and for the economy as a whole. And that was true before and it's true now with this administration as well. Clearly the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro growth policies at the margin, and for wanting to make it easier for banks to participate more constructively in the economy.\nAnd as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and you know, get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how that plays out. But. We're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system and there should be. Fortunately they're going to take a good look at it.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Bank Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates? Are the 90-day pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs... Is that enough or? I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs, what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90 days ago.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nif not all, of the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits, poorly done regulations, and all that. Obviously pro growth is good, pro business is good, pro de-reg is good. I think the best thing to do is to allow the Secretary of the Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they need to make regarding tariffs and with our trading partners.\nAnd I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be trade agreements themselves would be five or 10,000 pages long, and that's the best way to go about right now. That does not mean you won't have some of the effects take place anyway.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGot it. I guess as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the Treasury Markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99 to 4.50 in a matter of weeks. Just your comfort level in terms of the functioning of the Treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QE, QT, maybe even initiating some Treasury purchases? Any color would be great.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, but again. We have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all I don't think that's going to go away. And that relates to that. Obviously the US dollar still is the reserve currency and that isn't going to change. Though some people may feel slightly differently about it, and the Fed, we've been consistent there will be a kerfuffle of the Treasury Markets because of all the rules and regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in Covid, it happened before it happened. That will happen and then when that happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens.\nAnd they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it when they start to panic a little bit and we don't know if and when that's going to happen. We'll see. But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when you have huge global deficits back in the 70s, in the 60s, the guns and butter tariffs, at least our economists think, will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBut you know, for most people haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place and shortly in the next couple of months, and then we'll know.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nHey, good morning, Jeremy. Just with three to four cuts, sort of mostly in the back half June to December, how do you think about the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that trajectory and jumping off point into next year.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, it's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, you know, how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever, and my answer was like, well, you know, whatever guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on, you know, a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance contingent on that.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSo in that curve you're using.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nWhich we know will not happen.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. And the particular nuances you recall from last quarter where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook, including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory, is that it's both the timing of rates and our expected evolution of deposit growth in the different businesses and how have evolved and how that was all going to interact, producing potential trough in different moments and then so on and so forth. I think that given everything that's going on.\nOn that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly the back loaded cuts, all else equal from a run rate perspective, introduce a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We'll just have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nRight.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nIt will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options, and what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rates.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nRight. Maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously this kind of volatility tends to drive as corporates and investors go to cash tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the equation?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nA little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us, relative to our expectations. I don't think I can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess that.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI just also, it may not be deposits, maybe Treasury bills or various other things, and what you've seen, which is different; it's not the risk-off trade in the 10-year that is fundamentally different this time.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nRight. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions, one for Jamie to kick off. Jim, you've been through many cycles, and I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAlmost impossible to answer. You know, we look at all the cycles and, you know, we prepare for a full range of outcomes. I don't personally like predicting what the future is going to hold, but I do. I pointed out over and over there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those issues you are going to see them resolve for better or for worse in the next four months.\nMaybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. You actually know what the effect of some of these things was with some predictability and stuff like that. But the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile Markets. Credit losses go up, people get more conservative, investments go down. What looks like a recession, is it mild or hard? I don't know. But we are. I've been quite cautious and.\nYou can see it: our capital, liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can serve our clients through thick or thin, not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Okay. No, thank you for that.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThis is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy. And please read my Chairman's Letter. The most important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for democracy, that is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters. That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that.\nIt's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can we get there? And it's literally that. I mean, and the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change we've never seen in our lives.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then, one for Jeremy question on the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year on year. And then end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity, do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that'd be helpful too.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during the moments of peak uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question, like a day ago, whether we were seeing draws, meaning meaningfully observable draws from clients, and the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So I don't know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety, that people are more just focusing on addressing their supply chain issues right now.\nYeah. So on wholesale loans, beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story now. We're seeing a bit more growth, and sort of like, Markets loans supposed to traditional C&I loans in the current moment, but that's another turnaround there. Did you have. What did you ask? Also, front end of the yield curve liquidity.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, just in money Markets, Fed funds, you know, the front end. Seem to.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. What we've heard from our Markets colleagues is that that's actually functioning quite smoothly.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, Jamie, you just said on this call there's a quote deep recognition of flaws unquote by the new regulatory regime. Can you or Jeremy put some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid of as much red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline?\nI assume you'd pass on some of that to customers, and you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation, but before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman's Letter about the trade wars. Jamie, you went from trade wars quote get over it to this week say do something. Just as far as the tariff journey, you know, what were you initially expecting to what happened? Do you really think next earnings call will be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, no, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. My quote was, but to get over, I wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part of trade. So. It's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, you know, certain types of. Obviously you've heard about semiconductors. That was my quote about get to. I did not change my view about it. I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals.\nI think that would be good for everybody. They want to do it too. They've said they want to do it. They said they're having conversation of 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will be thousands of hundreds of people maybe, but it's not going to be passed on.\nBut it will reduce net, net the cost of liquidity, the cost of loans, and the cost of mortgages if it's done right. I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue. You know, my Chairman's Letter this year about, you know, if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing that right now.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYou also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending. If you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess back down by 1/5.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYou have to fix LCR, G-SIB, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various types of lending to the system. Some would be market, some would be middle market loans, etc. And I pointed out if you wanted to look at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%. And the reason for that is, it's not just capital, it is also LCR. It is also G-SIB. The question you should ask, you are very smart, Mike, is, could you have the same. And I believe you have a safer system.\nLend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs. Eliminate would have the First Republic or Silicon Valley. And you can accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to see them do. I don't know what's going to happen. You can read our 10-Ks. I think our 10-Ks are public and stuff like that. And so they should do that, just make a better system so you have the best in the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. And if you don't, I'd say look at these rules and regulations. See Europe. If that's where we want to go, let's just go there.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOne short follow up. Just, you know, Q1, you mentioned, you know, good credit, good trading, good EPS. I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international US company during trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be done, getting it done, because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply embedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks and, you know, we'll just have to deal with that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Just one follow up on this whole risk management regulatory front. You know, I see, I hear, and I agree. Flawed regulatory system could be better. We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held up okay so far. You and others have had borderline spectacular trading results. So has something changed? Are the systems better? Are the better able to handle as? Your risk management, your people, the diversity of your platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So I guess I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, you know, I mean, we're always continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be more complete and, you know, invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can. Associate that with the current performance. I think these just happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully.\nAnd to your point. I think your specific question of are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Market's franchise? The answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do, active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story. But whether we like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI agree with Jeremy. I'd add to that, volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that all things being equal is better, and it leads sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, Treasuries; that's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes like you're seeing in DCM today. You know, when you don't have these bond deals where you have less trading when you have. So it'll have lower volumes in certain Markets and stuff like that. And how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But you know, our folks do a great job, and we're here to help our clients.\nSo we know that volumes can go up or down, and spreads can go up or down and. But the plumbing of the system, I would say, the plumbing worked well during COVID too. It wasn't the plumbing that was a problem in. It wasn't even a problem. To go back to some of the real crises we've had, but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it stays true.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAnd I do think that the fact. That the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital Markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking about, about, you know, SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, you know, Basel, the whole panoply of items which interacts, as we've often talked about, and is miscalibrated. You know, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as a policy priority.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, Rob.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Thank you. And our final question will go to the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. You may proceed.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess I'll ask about cost since nobody's asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts?\nIf you do see a revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn, I think you do have in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of growth penciled in for investing in bankers, branches, tech, and marketing in, I guess. Does it make sense or under what conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments, or do you think that's just completely shortsighted unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, so you've slightly answered your own question there. But it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we talk about those as volume and revenue related expense. And so you will see those come down as a function of the environment.\nIt's also true that there are conceivably certain investment business cases which, depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyzed them originally, that is through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. So if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust.\nOf course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling through our traditional long term investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in increasing expenses in an environment where you may or may not have, you know, a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company. You know, this quarter, as it happens, you know, a question you might have is, you know, how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about,\nfor example, the investment banking outlook, but it's worth noting that investment banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know, Markets performance was very strong. There are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there's some sensitivity to the expense, basically to the strength of the dollar or the weakness in this case. While some of that is offset in revenue, it's a little noisy. That's a factor as well. It's small. I'm just highlighting that there are some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nCan you say the management thing? Because I think it's very important. I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses, and the good expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off. But there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do. You can imagine if you read my Chairman's Letter. The last section is called Management Learnings. If you look at companies that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance, and lack of attention to detail. So there is, you know, we're putting.\nWe're making a. Shouldn't say. But I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID that edit, the buildup in headcount, the buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home after all of those things. We just think there's more efficiency here. And I think some of the. And Mike, Mike Mayo mentioned the thing about regulator. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we. I pointed Resolution and Recovery, which is a complete waste of time is 80,000 pages long. It'll never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time is 20,000 pages long.\nOkay. We report a trillion dollars. I think it's a trillion bits of data every day or something like that to the. All the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we hopefully can get rid of and reduce the cost of the system. But it's not the new branches. So you know, the folks here are working on, you know, what we call streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount of saves and stuff like that. So we're having fun doing it. It's like, to me, it's like exercising, eating your spinach. It's what we should be doing. We haven't done it for a while. I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Financials Research, HSBC Securities\n\nOkay, that's very clear. Very helpful. Thank you\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay, thank you. We'll se you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day."

The JPMorgan Chase & Co. earnings conference call will begin shortly.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Q4 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81, and revenue of $43.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On page two, we have more on our Q4 results. The firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion, or 10% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was down $548 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances and CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances.\nNIR ex-markets was up $3.1 billion, or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. Markets revenue was up $1.2 billion, or 21%. Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion, or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $1.2 billion, or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation, as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million.\nOn page three, you can see the reported results for the full year. I'll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year, in CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and Security Services. and in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. Onto balance sheet and capital on page four.\nWe ended the quarter with a CTE1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page five. CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year.\nIn banking and wealth management, revenue was down 7% year-on -year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels.\nIn home lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Turning to card services and auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolve growth. In auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by card. The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher card revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page six. CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions.\nIn terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 20%, with better performance in credit, as well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets.\nEquities was up 22% on elevated client activity and derivatives, amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes in cash. Securities services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially.\nGlobal corporate and investment banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. Commercial real estate loans were flat, as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million, driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions.\nThen, to complete our lines of business, Asset and Wealth Management on page seven. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion, with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees.\nLong-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $104 billion for the full year, $140 billion for the full year, sorry. We had client asset net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 5% quarter-on- quarter.\nTurning to corporate on page eight, corporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a net loss of $30 million compared to the net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter.\nExpenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page nine. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth.\nWe expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024, as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits, firm-wide deposits have stabilized, and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth, as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar.\nAnd for completeness, we expect firm-wide NII to be approximately $94 billion, as a function of markets NII increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement, so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently.\nThe largest increase is volume and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth, as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven, as we continue to invest in new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of spend, as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our card business.\nAnd finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure, and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now, let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought.\nTaking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension, the risks and uncertainties in the environment, and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees.\nWe are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees, as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's premature about the deal, but I just want to say I'd be remiss not to say, here's a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading, and then became co-head of the investment bank and then sole head of the investment bank for 10 years.\nOver that whole time, helped him build one of the great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, he was president for five years or more, a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nGreat. All right. So let's go to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, good question, John, and welcome back, by the way. Welcome back, John. Read your opinion the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work. Thanks. So yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make, so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment.\nWe believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels, essentially, in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\nSo when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. and that is our current plan, although I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing, that the themes are remarkably consistent. So we are seeing the results of our kind of high certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well, and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the commercial and investment bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level.\nDaniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But broadly, the themes are very consistent. I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case.\nWe do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a lot of focus on the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency.\nWe also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization, and so that's embedded in there as well. Another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, excuse me, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing, so the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features, new product development, and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\nFinally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot, and it's been for very good reasons, and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But anytime you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front.\nSo we're going to try to run things with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second on roughly flat headcount, and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high certainty investment and growth, so obviously branches, bankers, and so on, and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nVery helpful. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nMD and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Simple, and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? Then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted. 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure, the unpredictability of capital requirements, and the regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for.\nSo why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be treasury secretary. It seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI do love what I do. Answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me. It's about the other senior people of the company. It's about the board. If I'm here for several more years and I may or may not be chairman of that, it's going to be up to the board to really fit the new CEO and stuff like that. Now you're talking potentially four or five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's just a rational thing to do. I've had a couple of health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense. What was your first question again?\n\nMike Mayo\n\nMD and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nWho's your successor? I mean,\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nit's just, look, guys, I mean, this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and all the tooling and throwing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that JPMorgan, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as chief operating officer and stay after that.\nSo obviously, she's willing to work for those people, which I think is great for a company just having continuity of management and leadership, and it'll be one of those people. Obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. Of course, at the last minute, a couple of years from now, people get sick, they change their mind, they have family circumstances. So even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nMD and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nSo you'll stay around maybe for a few more years, base case right now?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYep, base case. Yeah.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nMD and Head of U.S. Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon to be, I guess, a new head of regulation at the Fed. So maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you?. Is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down, or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something worth thinking about a lot, but I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve. I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question.\nSo backing off a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data, and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth.\nThe hope is that we get some of that and that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic, a little bit less adversarial, and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. Whether capital goes up, down, or stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just possible through endgame. It's also GSIB. It's also a number of other factors. That's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly, with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nNice break. Jeremy gave it all. I just have three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts for liquidity and discount windows and how else they are done, I think, is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public marks you want, what kind of private marks you want, what do you want in the banking system, what do you want out of the banking system.\nAnd the third is, I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine Balkanized system we built, which has negatives. And even the regulators will tell you that. So at one point, just take a deep breath, as Jeremy said, to do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nYep. That makes sense. Maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. It's a good question. I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide open capital markets, so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets, healthy balance sheets in small businesses, and maybe some residual caution.\nAnd maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near term. But we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najaria from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nMD and Head of Americas Financial Sector, UBS\n\nHi, Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of Jeremy's cross currents in terms of the denominator. So if we look at the Q3 regulatory data for your GSIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% GSIB. So obviously, from what we understand, if you print somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your GSIB surcharge goes up to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now.\nAt the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks in terms of the transparency. It looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7 is clearly a huge number. So as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So how should we think about those cross currents in terms of two big components? Clearly, one is your GSIB surcharge, and the other is your stress capital buffer.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nRight, Erica. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try to address this not in too much great length. First of all, GSIB. So yes, it was a high print in Q3, but we had normal seasonality, Q3 and Q4. So while our current view of the GSIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality.\nIt was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types. So that is more or less what you might otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed GSIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under five. Okay. You mentioned the lawsuit.\nI think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency, volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up.\nSo let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what is our core view about. I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about, if you just for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment?\nThe way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less. Then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nMD and Head of Americas Financial Sector, UBS\n\nAnd just a follow-up question to follow up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just the placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah.I mean, you've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nBut we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. I mean, you all know that everyone is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So steady, consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.\n\nOperator\n\nDoes that conclude your question, Erica?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThen we can go to the next question. Thanks. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now, or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. It's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple of different perspectives. So on the one hand, you're right. If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve playing out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal.\nYou could draw the conclusion that that means that the over-earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field. The current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see.\nDo we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming week.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nWe've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. It is worth noting that NII ex-markets is down year-on-year. So there's some amount of normalization now.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering, is it worth it?.\nIs there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risks of doing global consumer banking?.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I mean, I think you've kind of answered your own question in the sense. We talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different, and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. Pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.\nAnd it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nMD and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHey, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nMD and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nCan you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, \"What else is there to ask?\" Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook, and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to, could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting?.\nIs there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you've got the green market share number one. You've got the yellow. You've got the red places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are? Where they are? Are they just scattered? Every single business has one. Or are there some that have more than others and therefore more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure. Yeah. Let me take a crack at that, Betsy. so loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now, those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue.\nBut as you can see on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. While that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be, it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite. It's still growing above trend, obviously, which is great. It's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients. But the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates.\nRates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism. Could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more on the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our big long-standing investment strategies.\nThe biggest single one, arguably, is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country, and our capabilities, and our brand, and what we think we bring to the table. So that's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there, and it completes the franchise very nicely.\nThere are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking, and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level, we look great. In any given region, in any given subsector, we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nMD and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nMD and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGood morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of cross-currents. If we anchor to the fact that you're an administration that's taking place, you're going to take office with a focus on domestic CapEx, even if we don't get any rate cuts, when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah. I would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOh, I see what your question is. That took me a second. Yeah. I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus-year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate. So at some point, that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, alluding to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized. Arguably, wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities of the portfolio to rate shock.\nA lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jeremy, did you want to add to that? I would just add the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both on the consumer side, and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, subprime, and credit card.\nSo really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you're going to have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerability is. That's the vulnerabilities.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nMD and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nI guess thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, no one knows what the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah I mean, I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete, and therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way RRP is behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, etc., and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits.\nit's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about our sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nMD and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nMD, Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned in your comments about the overall firm-wide deposits have stabilized, and in the second half, you could see some growth. I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion.\nNow, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strain to in these consumer checking account deposits?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThat's fascinating, Gerard. I'll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers, but I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior.\nAnd so you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets.\nSo the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows, excellent client engagement, and success in the sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nMD, Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good, Then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with us the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective, not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital?\nIf you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity, you're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. So we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back, so he wants to go so,\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nGo ahead, Jeremy, go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNo, no. Seriously.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nI was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights, let us know. But most people don't want it. It doesn't enhance shareholder value. And I've never thought that having cash in your pocket is a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at like you have to \"deploy capital.\" So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special dividends, they really basically don't work.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nhas a different opinion, we're always interested.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nMD, Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nSounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we have no further questions at this time.\n\nJamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nThanks very much. See you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.4, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter on quarter. Markets revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts, and card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM.\nNow, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year component. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line of business. Now turning to page two for the firmwide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion or 20% year-on-year.\nExcluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. Revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic related NII partially offset by deposit margin compression, and lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses and markets. Revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year.\nExcluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, and credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by card. The net reserve build included $609 million consumer and $189 million wholesale onto balance sheet and capital. On page three, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher.\nThe preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in Q4 2024, and finally the firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in Q3 2024. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page four. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter on quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance.\nIn home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to card services and auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card NII on higher revolving costs. Balances: card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve, and in auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation, and continued growth in technology and marketing.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million year-over-year, predominantly driven by card as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. Our new commercial and investment bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment, in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise this quarter. IB fees were up 50% year-over-year, and we ranked number one year-to-date.\nWallet share of 9.5% in advisory fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a weak prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. YTD payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression, and higher deposit-related client credits were largely offset by fee growth moving to markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year.\nFixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products, and equity markets was up 21%. With equity derivatives up on improved client activity, we saw record revenue in prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security Services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels largely offset by deposit margin. Compensation expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation, legal expenses, and volume-related non-compensation expense in banking and payments. Average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels.\nAlso, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients in CRE. Higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the firm's modeled deposit approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher brokerage activity largely offset by deposit margin.\nCompensation expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams for the quarter long term. Net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income, and in liquidity we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year, and client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net income. Finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter on quarter. Turning to Corporate on page seven, Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa related gain, and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year.\nNII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year. Excluding foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on page eight. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex markets approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and credit card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. But to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong.\nAs always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. With that, let's open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease stand by.\nFor our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nJeremy, so wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the G-SIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for for some time as you evaluate just different capital scenarios. Are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nRight. Okay, thanks Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas. So, it's just going to be me today. Okay, good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE points first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% cycle target. And that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator.\nWhile we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect.\nYou know, most of those would be thought of as minigains rather than things that would actually like, increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading, and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything, you don't know, we don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day. The comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference.\nSo maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged. So review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend. And in that context, it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year.\nSo that's a testament to our performance, and that is a return of capital, and then finally, buyback. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter.\nAnd so, you know, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience.\nSo given all that, putting it all together, I'm sorry for the long answer. We remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital, and as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow up on NII. You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds in the second quarter. We did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating when you look at the system as a whole. Just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always have changed and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that, you know, there are net headwinds to deposit balances.\nSo when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as, you know, flat to slightly down, maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds.\nSo, you know, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But, you know, I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over-earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implies a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes.\nIn the end, we're kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Jeremy, thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the Stress Capital Buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI? Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher, and if you can give us a sense of what that process looks like?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, so I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed.\nYou know, not to confirm or deny that they even exist. You know, that stuff is private and.\nYou know.\nAnd then if you talk about like the timing here, right. So you know that the Stress Capital Buffer that's been released at 3.3% is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by 31 August. It may come sooner. You know, you talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. You know what we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable.\nYou would get a slightly higher Stress Capital Buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the Stress Capital Buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating.\nAnother example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage the capital of a bank, it leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So I'll leave it at that.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nOkay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns. On Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not ifs. And obviously Jamie's not there. He can't speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on a special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase where, you know, keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what, you know, what options you have available to deploy that capital?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure, yes. I mean, I would direct you to read. I'm sure you have Jamie's comments at the industry conference where he participated the week after Investor Day, because he went into a good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that.\nMany of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing.\nHe said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So I think the larger point is just that a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth and then the dividend. I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment. So that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it's buybacks. And Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price, buybacks, and valuation, and price is a factor. So.\nThat's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees up sequentially and 50% year-over-year. Saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space. We clearly didn't see the debt pull forward play through because your DCM was great. Again, I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. You know, people have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only that you're on the up from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So you know, the dialogue on ECM is elevated, and the dialogue on M and A is quite robust as well. So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats.\nSo on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward and therefore we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull forward risk becomes a little bit higher.\nOn ECM. If you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid cap tech growth space, and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, you know, in some cases people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds. That's an issue.\nAnd while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases people still have concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so we'll just have to see how that plays out.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on one on the consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side, obviously your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat, and 90 days come down a little bit. Any and is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYes, I still feel like when it comes to card charge offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations.\nAs I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohorts, inside the income cohorts. When you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary.\nBut the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say like they've been predicting it a couple years ago or whatever, you know, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth, and so it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So it all kind of hangs together.\nIn what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks very much. So Jeremy, the discussion so far around private credit and all your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit fund. I do think that most of that discussion has been about the direct lending component. So I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side? Because that's a bigger part of the world, and it's a bigger part of your business. So I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, thanks Glenn. So on.\nPrivate credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think.\nI guess one way the environment's evolving a little bit is that, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals and, sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment.\nYou know, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So.\nThe space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market.\nMaking their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best in class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it's maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in this space, so to speak. And then on.\nAsset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend. That continues to be the case. Clearly there must be something I'm missing. Now I can follow up on that, and maybe we can have a chat about it.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nNo, it's great for you if you're not hearing much about it. So we could leave it at that.\nMaybe just one quick follow up in terms of your just overall posturing.\nYou were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient.\nRates are high. I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nRight? I mean, on duration, you know, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple quarters. So, you know, that's one thing to say, that was more last quarter than this quarter. But I guess I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that.\nWhen you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So clearly it's true that empirically we've behaved very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both the earnings-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses including various types of scenario analysis including impacts on capital from higher rates. As I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates.\nIn fact, the forwards are not that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of mind for us.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nSuper helpful. Thanks so much for that.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks Glenn.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20 and more normalized at 17. Obviously you pointed to over-earning on NII, and I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20 to 17, and if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure, good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple things like you know our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable just based on your own or analyst consensus, whatever, and you think about fourth quarter like better to look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns and the quarterly numbers and you obviously you have to strip out kind of the one-time items. So if you do that like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of.\nOne source of headwinds is normalization of the NII primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's, you know, we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cut will come into the curve at some point. And, you know, in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have like expenses growing, revenues growing at some organic GDP-like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar, slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background, you know, you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen.\nSo as much as you know, our discipline on expense management is, you know, as tight as it always has been. There inflation is still non-zero, there are still investments that we're executing, there's still.\nHigher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, you know, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYep, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow up on the yield curve effects, I guess. What do you mean by that? Because right now the yield curve is inverted. Maybe you're still believing in the impact of that, but kind of longer term you expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. What does he mean by that? Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, I mean you and I have talked about this before.\nI guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of, many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra, extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot.\nBut when the steepness of the curve implies is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue, and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from the capital and other perspectives. So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road, and whether that could be.\nSort of earning the term premium so to speak could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you for the details.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, Jeremy. You said it's too early to end the over earning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs, the impact of lower rates, lower NII, DCM pull forward, and credit costs going higher.\nAnything I'm missing in that list and what would cause you to end the over earning narrative?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nNo, actually I think that is the right list, Mike.\nI mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the over-earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to. I mean, to the extent that that is through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that. That's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you've talked about. And the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over-earning.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYou're 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation. What is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nI mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger. And no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on, you know, SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands, and, you know, and obviously things like G-SIB recalibration and so on. So we've done, you know, a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did in Investor Day that improve. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%.\nWhich is why at Investor Day, when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nLet me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, you know, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital? He was basically telling me to take a hike. Right? And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time? Or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. I mean, Mike, you know, we've talked about this a lot, and Jamie's talked about this a lot. It's a very, very, very competitive market, you know, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very, very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number, actually. And.\nTo be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non banks, from US banks, from foreign banks, and all the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So.\nThe number has the range around it, obviously. So it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it again, assuming the reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products, services, regions, and segments.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, Jeremy.\nHi, Jeremy.\nSo I did want to ask one drill down question on Q2 and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So the question here is, what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter?\nI understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow? But even with that, so you get the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there, but you do the organic growth and then.\nIs it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are.\nI get this question from investors quite a bit, of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, that's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So.\nIn no particular order, one thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment, and we preserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the queue also. But I'm just going to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on Framework and Governors.\nSo generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now. Let's say, obviously, when, for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace. We kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the 4.9, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number, but where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made that we have these.\nSignificant item gains from Visa. If you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large cap financial stock that is Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. So in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock? We talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPMorgan, and that's what we did this quarter. That is why the 4.9 is a little higher. It's consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.\nBeyond that, what you're left with is my answer to Steve's question, which is that to your point about buying back earnings or whatever.\nWhen we're generating these types of earnings and there's this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically, and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend.\nYou know, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing. The CET1 ratio, the levels which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the other that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel that now is the right time.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nAll right, thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks Betsy.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi Jeremy, how are you?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHi, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJeremy, can you? I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the noninterest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter to quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that noninterest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period-end. The period-end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, good question, Gerard. I have to be honest. I hadn't focused on that particular sequential explanation, that is, quarter on quarter change in average non interest bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is, what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non interest bearing into interest bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it, you know, in the wholesale space, you know, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non interest bearing accounts, and over time, for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest bearing.\nSo we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore that will be a source of headwinds. And you know, that migration sometimes happens internally, that is, out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our wealth management business. And you know, some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So big picture, I do think that migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing. And that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now.\nBut yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. As a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency level. We all know about the commercial real estate office and you always talk about overearning on net interest income. Of course one of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment. I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the corporate investment bank you had about a $500 million pickup in nonaccrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? Again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase",
    "content2": "Yeah, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you. Like the C&I charge off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge off rate over the preceding 10 years was something like literally zero. So that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture.\nAcross bankers and the risk team, you know, that's not, we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So you have to assume there'll be some upward pressure on that. But you know, in any given quarter the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So I don't think that anything in the current quarter results is indicative of anything broader. And I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI would say great. Appreciate the insights as always. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. I just had one cleanup question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify, for once and for all, sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier.\nTry to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, happy to clarify that. So Jamie's comments were that the allowance, the build and the card allowance, we're talking about cards specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I said here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher. But you know, it's in the ballpark and I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, you know, last time I checked it still looked a little low on that front, so who knows what it will actually wind up being. But that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is, you know, how to reconcile that build to the 12%, you know.\nThat we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. The reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolving in that 12% as well as seasoning of earlier vintages which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks Erika.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. Seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand, and is there further opportunities to grow that? And then secondly, outside of cards, loan demand has been quite weak. And any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Jim. Good question. So yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured financing related sort of matched book repo type stuff and similar things that gross up the balance sheet quite a bit but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and is very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients, it's not really particularly RWA and therefore capital intensive and therefore doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak, on the loan demand front. Yeah, I mean, unfortunately I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning to your point, loan demand remains quite muted.\nEverywhere except card. Our card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth, that's going to make sense. And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that, but it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, you know, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to, you know, lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box. You know, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally.\nFrankly, that is in some sense a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it. In terms of being patient, that's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nRight, okay, great. Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nVery good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day."

If you are a participant, you may hear music until the leader activates the conference. Your passcode has been confirmed. You will be joined in listen-only mode. The conference is being recorded. If you object, you can disconnect now.\nThe JPMorgan Chase & Co. earnings conference call will begin shortly.\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation.\nPlease stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44, on revenue of $42.5 billion, and delivered a ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase, the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights, firm-wide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM, as well as in the CCB wealth management business.\nOn page two, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic, given that going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense, and $668 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firm-wide results excluding First Republic, revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion, or 4% year-on-year. NII X Markets was up $736 million, or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as well as higher revolving balances in card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR X Markets was up $1.2 billion, or 12%, driven by higher firm-wide asset management and investment banking fees, as well as lower net investment securities losses.\nMarkets revenue was down $400 million, or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion, or 9% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees, and the increase to the FDIC special assessment. Credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $116 million, predominantly driven by card. Onto balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income, which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects, including higher client activity in markets, and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower card loans. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page four.\nConsumers remain financially healthy, supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits, with average balances down 7% as RCD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In home lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%.\nMoving to Card Services and Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth, and lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. In Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $825 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting a build in card, largely offset by release in Home Lending. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page five.\nBefore reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and investor day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results, including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial & Investment Bank segment, in line with the reorganization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions, with debt up 58% and equity up 51%.\nIn terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue, and the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prior year quarter, partially offset by strong results in securitized products. Equity markets was flat.\nSecurity Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Banking on page six. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher non-interest revenue. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year, with increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth, net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense.\nAverage deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits, and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious, and CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page seven. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year.\nExcluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, and the impact of the JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year, and client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were flat. Turning to corporate on page eight. Corporate reported net income of $918 million.\nRevenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million, compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on page nine. We now expect NII ex-Markets to be approximately $89 billion, based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion.\nThe primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the markets business, and as a reminder, changes in markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter, and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged, and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate.\nThis is a smaller gap than we've previously observed, and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income. We're just mentioning this to help with your models. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results, even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical, and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent, and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges, as well as any others that may come our way. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGood morning.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo a couple of questions here. Just one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend, kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR, and also help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio range should be, because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%.\nI know we have to wait for Basel III Endgame re-proposal to come through and all that, but should we be expecting that, \"Hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules\"? Thanks.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. So Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. Thrilled to have you on this call. For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode, and to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here. But Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years, has been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here. And so you're asking a pertinent question.\nSo we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. If you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3, 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. We'd like to give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, etc. I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%. I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically would prepare us for the total Basel III endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.\nRemember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst case. It'll be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that. Yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. I mean, pay the dividend, steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's appropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices.\nI think you've all heard me talk about the world, things like that. So, waiting in preparation for Basel, hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also it's very important to put in mind there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1 too. So you may see us do things in the short run that increase earnings, increase capital, but using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading. We could do things now. So it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind excess capital is not wasted capital. It's earnings in store.\nWe will deploy it in a very good way for our shareholders in due course.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBetsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year and buyback. The trajectory is $2 billion.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOh, sorry. $2 billion a quarter.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOtherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer, but welcome back, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you so much, and appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on 20 May.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nExcellent. Us too.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nHey, good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter?\nIf there's been any change, have you seen that migration start to slow or not?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. Good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about, are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that.\nWe really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where, even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable. And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in Q4 that had 6 cuts in it. We were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nOkay. And just a follow-up on that, and just sort of bigger picture on NII, is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. So I mean, I think the drivers are, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly three cuts in it. So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration.\nThere is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace. And you know this, obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot.\nSo the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. Right.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for the color.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the street might need to build in more reserve growth for the card growth. You've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of card growth and reserve build needs?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, John. So in short, yes to both questions.\nSo yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities, our parameters, and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the CSL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine.\nBut we're narrowly just saying that based on the card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just to follow up, to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets' NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion, but revenue neutral, I guess the obvious thing is there's typically an offset in fee income. And you don't guide to that, but the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet's evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets' fees from the lower Markets' NII, correct?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThat is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within markets.\nYou can actually see a little bit of a pop of the market's balance sheet and supplement, and these things are all related. So fundamentally, you can think of it as we either hold equities on the balance sheet, non-interest-bearing, high funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So that shifts as a function of the sort of borrow relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second-order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex-markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you.\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher for longer, maybe the economy is too strong, so we don't get any rate cuts. Are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers, where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks Jamie's pointed out, but I'm just trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSo I would say consumer customers are fine. Unemployment is very low. Home prices are up.\nStock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out. Not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape, and if you go to recession, they're in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up. Their order books are up. Their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, etc. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year.\nLook at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas, and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, etc. So we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time was always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time you've had it. So I'm just on the more cautious side that how people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so everything's okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are.\nAnd the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates, yield curves, NII, and credit losses, it's one thing to project it today based on what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen, like higher rates with this modest recession, etc., then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happiness is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection points in the economy, literally in my life or in history.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate, both for JP and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerabilities and issues beyond office CRE? How would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. I'll put it into two buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think our multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less.\nWell, obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real estate. It's true for everybody. And that happens. Leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring, filling things out, and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect, including multifamily. That will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010.\nSo I just put in the back of your mind, the why is important. The interest rates are important. The recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities, different types, and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with a recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks, and not just real estate. If in fact that happens.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you so much. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Erica Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Hi. Good morning.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nGiven that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of investor day, I guess six weeks from now or five weeks from now, if we think about that 17% through the cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nRight. So interesting framing of the question, Erica. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins, and increases in weighted average rate paid. So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently.\nYou've also heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, it's a bit less clear the extent of over-earning. And in card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the, what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on? And you did talk about investor day.\nI was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at investor day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by investor day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed, at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away.\nAnd so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind.\nGot it. Just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter that it seems like the market's now pricing in, obviously, no June cut, no September cut, and a toss-up in December, which should matter for this year? As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much, given that it seems like June is the only one that would?\nYeah. Sorry, Erica. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NIIX, not on total NII. So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion.\nNumber two, if you want to do math for the changes of the average fund rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, be my guest. It's as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the 900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. We've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, etc., etc., etc. So we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions, and it's going to be what it's going to be, which we know are going to be wrong.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nOperator\n\nJeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about, \"We all have hopes and expectations for the investment banking pipeline to continue to move along.\" We obviously saw the good movement in ECM, DCM, and the lag in advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with what relates to M&A on go/no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then what do you think we need to have to kickstart just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSure. Yeah. So let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly.\nI think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, and carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better. Sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in Q1.\nSo that's a factor. And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM, acquisition financing, and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this? So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said, I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A. A little bit cautious about the pull forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\n\nGot it. I guess I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets. Not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comps and FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But maybe just talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business. Do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Thanks.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. Really good question. I would say in general that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the markets revenue pool.\nI think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment, as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. While that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious, like, \"Oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here?\" For now, that does seem to be the new normal. I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. All of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth.\nSo I think that those are some of the themes on the market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see you put a lot of effort into that, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risks, and all that over several years. It's not weeks or months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, consumer, or wholesale payments.\n\nOperator\n\nSo I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks. Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's out of leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my hands, for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right?\nIf we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, etc., etc. In that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest with the cycle, that we sort of don't go into countries and then leave countries, etc., obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks. We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. In terms of the wholesale payments business, it's going great. We're taking share.\nThere's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sure we'll give you more color in other settings on that. But it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nJust as a follow-up to that, then, why is it doing great in terms of wholesale payments, given such the dislocation of the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else? Why is wholesale payments doing great?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nWell, I think one of the things about payments businesses is that in some sense, they're, I mean, recession-proof is probably the wrong word. And in any case, we're not dealing with a recession. But we're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world. And that's a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what.\nSo that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that our willingness to invest, which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so we are seeing the benefits of that. All right.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may proceed.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on investment banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger picture question in terms of you're always so good in spelling out where you're over-earning. Do you feel like you're under-earning on the investment banking side?\nAnd I just used some of your own numbers from the past of, look, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap the last 10 years. Yet the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So is there just a bigger upside, and it's just a matter of when, not if?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah. Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're under-earning in investment banking right now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, and at this point, it was like March 2020, right? It was the beginning of the pandemic. So it's like four years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period.\nAnd you would expect the wallet to grow with that. So I do think there's meaningful upside in the investment banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. And yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nCool. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision an environment, or maybe I should rephrase that? What type of environment would have JPMorgan pulled back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious what I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some auto governors in this, right? Some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one. Point two is that independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it.\nIn a world where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale, and try to extract that efficiency. I think to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't.\nCould there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because through the cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged simply because of the business cycle in the short term.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we did see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year over year, but not necessarily translated into higher revenues. And I know they don't match up necessarily each quarter.\nBut maybe just elaborate how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYeah, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like into relatively short duration assets, strategies, or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason and what might be thought of as a tactical sense.\nSo he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have, and the extent to which this quarter's increase in markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital in RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is that the higher run rate of the markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, GSIB capacity utilization, etc., in the markets business. And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured.\nThat's part of the DNA. We continue to do it, and we will. We still are operating under multiple binding constraints. Obviously, the environment is complex. The ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty. It does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGot it. Then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year over year. Obviously, still a very strong pace.\nAny trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category or either overall or among certain segments? Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.",
    "content2": "Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So I do think spend is fine, but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, etc. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into non-discretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where, in the while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some, or rather just a distribution of outcomes.\n\nOperator\n\nThere's some set of people whose real incomes are not up. They're down and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. What you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up. I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the lower class is that big. It is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets. That's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Co Head of Global Financials Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHi, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHey, Gerard. How are you doing?\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Co Head of Global Financials Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nGood, thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course, Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share, or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nRight. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets and to some extent the leveraged lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight.\nSo I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening. That, in secondary markets, that I think has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool.\nYou start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned. As we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. You are seeing a little bit of that. I think that away from the leveraged lending space and the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, you were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has survived the last few weeks. It's always a little bit hard to observe in any case.\nBut I would say broadly the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Co Head of Global Financials Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you. And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there as both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan, how you balance the two out where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like, but at the same time, you're supporting their business?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community. You're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise. And it's all good at some level. But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, \"Oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending?\" It's, \"What does it take to be good at this stuff?\" And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo.\nSo you need underwriting skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. This is what we do. We're really good at it. Increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. So in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space.\nAt the same time, the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unit trust structures gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Co Head of Global Financials Research, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nAppreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, Gerard.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nFounding Partner and Senior Banking Analyst, Portales Partners LLC\n\nGood morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a home run. And I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter.\nWhen you look at Q1, it annualizes out to $2.728 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. Now, I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that? Because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million, down from $900 million. And then secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less? And that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.728 billion? So that's my first question.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Charles. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces.\nSo yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. And so that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think, as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full-year perspective, you just have the offset of the full-year calendarization effect. There's maybe an embedded question in there too about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real. The expenses are real. And also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people.\nIt's going well, but we're not done yet. It takes a lot of effort. Broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we'd originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. Of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. Therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. That means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative.\nThey were based on kind of more typical type of market assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So yeah, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charles.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nFounding Partner and Senior Banking Analyst, Portales Partners LLC\n\nOkay. As a quick follow-up, where are the next home runs going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan. But there's probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for roll-ups of failed banks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So that's my question.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nRight. Okay, Charles. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things to be my best answer to your question.\nAs we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. As Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. Right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well-positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders. Obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong.\nBut the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nFounding Partner and Senior Banking Analyst, Portales Partners LLC\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day."

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Q4 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page one. The firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. On page two we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business for the quarter. First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense, and $647 million of net income.\nNow focusing on the firm-wide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7%. Year on year, NII ex Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11% from predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex markets was up $139 million or 1%, and markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology, and credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by card and single-name exposures in wholesale which were largely previously reserved.\nThe net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the commercial bank. Looking at the full year results on page three, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On the balance sheet and capital on page four, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains, and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III endgame requirements. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5.\nTotal debit and credit card spend was up 7% year on year, driven by strong account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was up 6% year on year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits, with average balances down 8% year on year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail.\nNet new money in home lending revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII moving to card services, and auto revenue was up 8% year on year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolving, and in auto originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year on year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors, and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge offs, which were up $791 million year on year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB, on page 6, the CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year on year. IB fees were also up 13% year on year, and we ended the year ranked number one with wallet share of 8.8%, and advisory fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity.\nBut, as announced, M&A remains a headwind, and the extent, as well as the timing, of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year on year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat, as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year on year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter of 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue in rates. Coming off a strong quarter last year, equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash security services. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year on year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year on year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation.\nCompensation credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7, Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year on year, largely driven by higher NII where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $924 million was up 32% year on year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year on year, driven by an increase in employees, including front-office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition.\nAverage deposits were down 6% year on year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher-yielding alternatives, and flat quarter on quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end.\nLoans were down 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious, and CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million driven by deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8, Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans.\nExpenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares for the quarter. Net long-term inflows were $12 billion positive across equities and fixed income, and $140 billion for the full year in liquidity. We saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. We had record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year on year driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. Finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter on quarter.\nTurning to Corporate on page 9, Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year on year. NII of $2.5 billion was up $1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million compared with the net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned up front. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024 starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve which currently includes six cuts this year on deposits.\nWe expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels, while lower rates should decrease repricing pressure. We remain asset sensitive and therefore the lower rates will decrease NII resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. Keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain.\nOn total NII we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in markets NII which as always you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now let's turn to expenses on page 11.\nWe expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at Investor Day, and between now and then, on the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firm-wide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023.\nBut in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes: bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net, net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as a result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company.\nWe've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year on year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up on credit. We continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5% consistent with Investor Day guidance. So in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over earning as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through the cycle target.\nAs we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease stand by.\nFor our first question. It's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. You know, I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out again as we highlight on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then just separately, you bought back a couple billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, good question. I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on organic capital generation. So the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest base of buybacks, consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of, you know, probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also, just as a reminder, you know, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, actually, John, this quarter that's all like, pretty quiet. So the weighted average unemployment rate in the number is still 5.5%.\nWe didn't have any really big revisions.\nIn the Macro Outlook driving the numbers.\nOur skew remains as it has been, you know, a little bit skewed to the downside.\nJust recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see.\nThat skew and the difference between the.\nWeighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6 peak off the current levels.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, and then just a follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like, what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter, like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on, like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure, yeah, happy to do that, John. So I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our ROE number.\nAs you know, we don't update that.\nUntil the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So I think something like 1.9 as opposed to 2.1.\nSo, just round numbers, about $2 billion in a year.\nI think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that just because.\nEven though we do model lags in.\nThis year, we've been seeing, you know, the lag effect be a little bit bigger, but you know, just crudely, I think you, you know, as I noted, we do remain asset sensitive.\nThat's one way to quantify it.\nI would say the empirical number would.\nMaybe be a little higher than that.\nHopefully that gives you enough to work with.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of James Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just a follow up in a different way on the NII question. Just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts and then layering in, if we do get Fed cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?\nYeah, both good questions. So let's just do reprice first. So I think all else equal this.\nMore dovish Fed environment and these six.\nCuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level rep price.\nAt the same time we do continue to expect internal migration, you know, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs.\nIn wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing, and that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at, you know, weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts. And you know, that's actually intuitive when.\nYou think about it as people continue.\nMigrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying.\nTo do beta type math with like, you know, change in rates and change.\nIn rate path, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah.\nYou'll note that I said that our.\nOutlook is for balances to be very.\nModestly down, which, you know, when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations.\nAbout having it slow down later in the year continues, and that loan growth in the system as a whole is.\nExpected to be quite muted.\nYou know, it's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rate.\nI kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin.\nA little bit more supportive for system wide deposit balances.\nObviously we continue to be.\nOptimistic about our ability to take share.\nIn deposits, you know, based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.\nRight. Okay, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Ibrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.\n\nIbrahim Poonawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGood morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear. I'm not sure if Jamie is on the call, but maybe. Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around. Do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing incorrectly or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nRight. Okay.\nSo I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significant, significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus in terms of consumer resilience. I made some comments about this on the press call. You know, the way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized.\nAnd the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spend behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So, you know, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios, is a very strong labor market and a very strong labor market means all else equals strong consumer credit. So that's how we see the world.\n\nIbrahim Poonawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nAnd maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filtered into multifamily apartments. You all have a pretty large multifamily exposure, high quality, but just give us a sense of one, are you seeing any bleed through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah. So, good question on the multifamily.\nThe short answer is that for us it's pretty uncontroversially no bleed through. The reason is that while there is, we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. It's higher end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. As you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable supply constrained markets. The performance there remains really very robust.\n\nIbrahim Poonawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGood, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. My first question is a follow up on Matt's with regard to the buyback, you printed 15% CET1 in the quarter.\nOn a net basis, net to RWA growth. Your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed, or will, you know, will having clarity in the June DFAST results you mentioned the SCB sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, Erika, it's a good question and.\nI understand what you're asking, why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients. Right. Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now, but obviously we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime. And we may well do that.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant?\nIncrease or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nA little bit of that is in there. Yeah. So you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue related category. And I think in my prepared remarks you will have noted that I talked about a $1 billion increase in that category year on year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. So you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses. That's up $7 billion year over year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So if you could just up front give us visibility. How much of that is due to incentive pay? How much does that do to tech? How much does that do to AI? And what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pickup? Thanks.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYup, Mike, thanks for the question.\nAnd yeah, and of course you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency, and I'm going to follow the structure that we use on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver. Overall, it's an 8% increase year on year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand, and engagement in our card products. And so that shows up in marketing.\nAs you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority.\nYou know, I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So for example, in 2023 we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years we increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future.\nIn AWM. Continued Client Advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have more little bit of volume and revenue related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our our long standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategies.\nSo we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise, and then you know, as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume- and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook.\nI do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that.\nWe're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely.\nThe best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.\nFinally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm even though it's very bottoms up driven, and those drivers are consistent with what they've been: new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say, actually in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. I have a short follow up. I'm still here.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSure.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I asked you this before and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars, but how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little bit more meat on the tech bones.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, sure. So let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for investor day if you don't mind, but I will address the AI point. So as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the operating committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this, and in partnership with Lori Beer and all of the technology organization. So I think that I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there.\nAt the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way that's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well chosen list of high impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way. That's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Ling.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nGerald Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi Jeremy, how are you?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHi, Gerald.\n\nGerald Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed funds rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it that your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker or is it just your economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice.\nWe just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.\n\nGerald Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, very good. And then as a follow up, obviously you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that it hasn't, QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYes, good question, Gerard.\nI mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that, you know, the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing, you know, from system-wide deposits in the last six months of this year. That's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so that's been supportive of system-wide deposits as we go into 2024. RRP is, you know, at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind.\nBut it's also the case, as you know, that there's, you know, the market's expectation is that the Q2 is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So, and you know, we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, you know, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits, maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.\n\nGerald Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks, Gerald.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nThere's been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and?\nHow.\nThe change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM, and DCM?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, sure.\nSo, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, you know that helps higher and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post launch performance or whatever. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline. But I'm not too concerned about that in general. So I would expect to see rebound there in DCM. Again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change.\nSo sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So you know, that can go both ways, and then M&A, you know, it's a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year, and so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024, although it's equal. And of course we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, you know, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. On the flip side, in C&I you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down? Or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, it's a good question.\nI mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access.\nIn the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that driver involve utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suites which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be. I would think if things turn out a little bit worse, I think, you know, management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on and so you might see utilization even lower.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thank you. So I want to get your perspective on private credit. Overall, the industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending, but now you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them in the rain. A lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So my question to you is how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does J.P. Morgan adapt and participate?\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, thanks, Glenn.\nSo, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nIn what is one of the key.\nKey things that we offer as a company. So it is a meaningful shift in the environment. It's something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head to head with the private credit providers, and these types of unitranche structures if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade off between, you know, the best possible pricing versus, you know, speed and certainty of execution. And we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong, long, long time DCM franchise. So that's been a priority and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.\nIn the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III endgame, people talk a lot about.\nThe risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear. These are important clients of ours too. We compete with them; they're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people and regulators in particular should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAnything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nIt's interesting.\nI haven't heard much about that, Glenn, so we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, cool.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you for that.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nAnalyst, Portales Partners\n\nThank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming because you'll have a full year in 2024, First Republic, that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say from $3.7 billion this year to $5 to 6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting 6 rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So if you're talking about rate cuts that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nYeah, thanks Charlie. So one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood need to track that, and we've been splitting out First.\nRepublic and our reported results in order.\nTo improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. So we really focused on having our guidance be firm-wide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back.\nOf the envelope math, but we did.\nHave some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. Then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the NII, per my response to the prior question, because that NII fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. So I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about.\nIt for the company.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nAnalyst, Portales Partners\n\nJust to make sure I understood what you're saying. So you have NII ex-markets going from 94 to 88.\nWithin that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nIt's kind of matched the day we did it. So yeah, I mean I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding a First Republic. If I do the big picture right? So big picture, 2023 we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024 we're going to have 12. So all else equal there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of that pull to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably.\nJuiced the 2023 number a little bit. So therefore straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated, so I'd rather not go there.\n\nCharles Peabody\n\nAnalyst, Portales Partners\n\nAll right.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe do have no further questions at this time.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nOkay, thanks very much, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase\n\nSa.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum; and their Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.\n\nJames Dimon\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nGood morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into discussions about third quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world, and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of firm-wide legal expense.\nOn Page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 billion of net income.\nNow focusing on the firm-wide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year-on-year. NII ex markets was up $4.8 billion or 28% driven by higher rates and higher revolving balance card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. End markets revenue was down $190 million or 3% year-on-year.\nExpenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year-on-year primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion predominantly driven by net charge-offs in card and included a $102 million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth.\nOn to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III end game proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we'll continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances [indiscernible] or opportunities emerge.\nAnd on the topic of the Basel III end game, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it.\nAnd while we know the interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large, given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well capitalized and well positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting, and there's a lot that does not make sense to us.\nStarting with RWA. We've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint.\nWe've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA.\nOur view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with the GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer.\nAlthough there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio.\nNow let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SACR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%.\nSo assuming the Basel III endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB.\nAnd of course, given the absence of effect to the GSIB flaws, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital reform.\nWe think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel-compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III end game consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements.\nAs you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time.\nThe current proposal exacerbates existing features to discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers.\nIn addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggest that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude.\nWith that, we go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend for customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower income groups normalizing faster.\nTurning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked #1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers.\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on-quarter, but they remained down 15% year-on-year.\nMoving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization [indiscernible]. And then auto originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year predominantly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending.\nNext, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year, and we ranked #1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity.\nIn terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1% driven by an increase in financing and trade activity and securitized products as well as improved performance in credit. This was predominantly offset by Currencies & Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year.\nEquity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nExpenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were a net benefit of $185 million driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million.\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year driven by higher rates and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume.\nExpenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives.\nLoans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million.\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits.\nExpenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year driven by continued growth in our private banking advisory teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and global shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of [ $40 billion ].\nAUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year, and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year driven by continued net inflows of higher-margin levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5% driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year.\nTo finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable.\nOur outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment.\nOn credit, we now expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5% mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth.\nSo to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty. And all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.\nAnd with that, let's open the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to the live presentation. Please standby.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Burnham. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 25%..\nThese results included the First Republic borrowing purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio of $1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Touching on a few highlights. TCV client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM, and we ranked #1 in IVP Wallet Share.\nBefore giving you more details on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on Page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule, the number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding at pace, and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024.\nThe First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2, and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market, we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition.\nNow turning back to this quarter's results on Page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier. I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the firm-wide level, then for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, this quarter, First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue $599 million of expense and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain, which is reflected in NIR in the corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build.\nAnd remember that the deal happened on May 1, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue allowance in CCB, CV and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses aren't corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments.\nNow turning back to firm line results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII X markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates and IRX markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items, primarily in the prior year.\nAnd markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on-year primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense.\nAnd credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in card and a $243 million release in corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later.\nOn to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the 2 charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio.\nAnd as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. our new indicative SCV is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4%, and it goes into effect in 4Q '23. The new SCV also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter.\nOn liquidity, our bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our earnings and risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lines.\nSo when we released this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100 basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion, whereas in the absence of the change, it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5.\nBoth U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient, and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results, which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, [ CV ] and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion was up 31% year-on-year.\nIn Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End of period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments and seek higher-yielding products.\nClient investment assets were up 18% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our adviser and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and grown new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover.\nExpenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and head count growth as we continue to invest in our [ firm ] office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting a reserve build of $203 million, driven by loan growth in Card Services.\nNet charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card as 30-day plus delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on Page 6.\nCIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7%, excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. CIB fees were down 6% year-on-year, and we ranked #1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%.\nIn Advisory fees were down 19%, and Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.\nHowever, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products group and credit.\nEquity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior year quarter, particularly in derivatives. A Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and head count growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7.\nCommercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates.\nGross investment banking and markets revenue of $767 million down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including fun office hiring technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense.\nAverage deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in nonoperating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing.\nCRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior year originations for construction loans and real estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the [ flow ] state market as well as net downgrade activity in middle market banking.\nThen to complete lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows.\nExpenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the impact of global shares and JPMorgan Asset Management in China both of which closed within the last year.\nFor the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes, led by fixed income and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of Global shares.\nAnd finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to corporate on Page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in corporate.\nExcluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year. NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million or up $384 million year-on-year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as [indiscernible].\nNext, the outlook on Page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and [ NII X ] markets to be approximately $87 billion, the increase driven by higher rates, coupled with lower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remained and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out.\nOur expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules.\nNonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to the [ JPMorgan Chase's ] First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in corporate.\nBefore reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and the recent televised interview. So I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm.\nAs you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the firm-wide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter end.\nIt's important to note that while the sequential period end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook, which I will address at the end still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows.\nNow back to the quarter touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share. Consumer spending remained solid with combined debit and credit card spend, up 10% year-on-year. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.\nOn Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex-markets was down $1.1 billion or 10% driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower Auto lease income on lower volume. And market revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year.\nExpenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year driven by compensation-related costs, reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter, which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted average economic outlook.\nOnto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders.\nNow let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid, and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter.\nMoving to financial results. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher-yielding products, as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our Wealth Management offerings.\nClient investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue.\nMoving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios.\nNext, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked #1 with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity.\nIn terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging.\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows. And currencies in emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year.\nEquity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation.\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates. And gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity.\nExpenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front-office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition and nonoperating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances.\nLoans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In middle market banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in CapEx spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt.\nCRE loans were also up 1% sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds for both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on Commercial Real Estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets. And nearly 2/3 of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million, predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront.\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion, pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management joint venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our Private Banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run rate impact of acquisitions.\nFor the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by fixed income and equities. And then liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%, driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures.\nNext, the outlook on Page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both Consumer and Wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed [ cuts ] later in the year as well as slightly higher Card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook, given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year.\nI would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags. We think a more sustainable NII ex-markets run rate in the medium term is well below this quarter's $84 billion as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance. And while we don't know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s.\nAnd of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment, including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects.\nMoving to expenses. Our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%.\nSo to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nWe will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had 2 significant items in Corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities loss.\nTouching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year, with growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. We ended the year ranked at #1 for global IB fees with a wallet share of 8%, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.\nOn Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72% driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower Auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year.\nExpenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm's macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty.\nLooking at the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA.\nRWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached 1 quarter early. So given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.\nNow let's go to our businesses, starting on Page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data.\nCombined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat.\nCash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year.\nNow moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on-year. You'll notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates.\nDeposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows, where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customers. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue.\nMoving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And then Auto originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by Auto lease depreciation from lower volumes.\nIn terms of credit performance this quarter. Credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year.\nNext, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity.\nIn terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter.\nMoving to Markets. Revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year.\nPayments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels.\nExpenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation.\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year. Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of nonoperating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% sequentially.\nC&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity.\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins and lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management and performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines.\nExpenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across equities and Fixed Income, and $47 billion for the full year.\nAnd in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the 2 significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year.\nWith that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10, while I take a sip of water. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023.\nGoing through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumers.\nIn addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall Card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale.\nBut it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different, and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and may be quite different from what this outlook assumes.\nAnd further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII. As the guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates. But remember, this is offset in Markets NIR.\nNow turning to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers. We expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth as well as our plans for a modest headcount increase in the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments.\nAnd on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest increase than last year. The themes remain consistent, and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May.\nOf course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent, as always.\nMoving to credit on Page 12. On the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, Card and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook, for Card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at our recent conference, and our outlook hasn't really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs. And it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year, with the associated charge-offs following about 6 months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022, but still well below fully normalized levels.\nSo let's turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap-up before going to Q&A. We're very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I've emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near term, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation, please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 18%. The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S. treasuries and mortgages.\nOur strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment. Touching on a few highlights, we had a record third quarter -- we had record third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked #1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low.\nOn Page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year-on-year. Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%. NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year-on-year.\nExpenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year-on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending.\nOn the balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI.\nRWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA. Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023. These current targets include a 50 basis point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters.\nTo conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack.\nNow let's go to our businesses, starting on Page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year-on-year. Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments.\nHowever, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year-on-year, particularly in the lower income segments. And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook.\nNow moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year-on-year.\nIn Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked #1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year-on-year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks. And we are now #1 in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top ranked in the 3 largest markets.\nClient investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year-on-year on lower production margins and volume.\nMoving to Card & Auto. Revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% and while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates.\nExpenses of $8 billion were up 11% year-on-year driven by the investments we're making in technology, travel, marketing and branches.\nIn terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year-on-year, largely driven by loan growth in Card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending. Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization.\nNext, to CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year-on-year. IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our #1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%.\nIn Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity.\nIn terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions. Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth.\nMoving to Markets. Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in Securitized Products. Equity Markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity.\nPayments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees.\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year-on-year. Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million.\nMoving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year-on-year.\nDeposits were down 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of nonoperating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust.\nLoans were up 13% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking.\nFinally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low.\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pretax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines.\nExpenses of $3 billion were up 10% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management initiatives.\nFor the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities and alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year-on-year respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year-on-year.\nNext, the outlook on Page 9. Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm-wide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around 0, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion.\nWhile we're not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex Markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023. Today's guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion. And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023.\nIn addition, there's quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth, so keep both of those things in mind, as you update the 2023 estimates in your models.\nMoving to expenses. Our outlook remains unchanged. And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations.\nSo to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter, as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks.\n\nJames Dimon\n\nChairman & CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nJeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I just wanted to give you a little more insight into how we're looking at capital and interest rates a little bit. So capital planning, we're very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns. And more importantly than that is we're growing franchise value, I think, all around the firm.\nAnd in most areas, we're up in market share, in a few areas, we're not, and of course, that disappoints us. But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we'll get over that 13% in the first quarter. But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things. So we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don't know when and how this is going to be, and any change in G-SIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind.\nAOCI. AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical. So think of it (inaudible) 100 basis points, that's $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind.\nCECL. CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we'll have to add to reserves, and/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we'll change our reserves.\nPut in the back of your mind that if your unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you're probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just does affect capital a little bit.\nAnd then RWA management, I mean, I think we're showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that. With that, what I would say, a very limited financial effect. And the way you should look at this is we don't tell commercial bank or investment bank don't get new business, don't serve new clients. So we're serving clients that we always do, and you see the loan books growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us.\nSo we're not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate them the most part because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices. And so we've got a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we're going to find ways to reduce RWA. I'm talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises.\nInterest rates. I think the way to look at it is we're fairly neutral at this point. Interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today. And I'm just going to mention a few. We're not worried about them. It's not going to change things dramatically, but does change things. What's going to be QT's effect on deposits? How much deposit migration you're going to have in this new technological environment? And there are pluses and minus from that.\nAnd of course, there are lags in consumer. There can be some lags in treasury services. There can be some lags in commercial banking. So it's just on the back of the mind, we're going to kind of actively manage that.\nAnd the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be more to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities. We don't want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better. So you might expect to see that taking place now.\nThere may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that. We're not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure. But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things. We just do it the most efficient and effective way. I want the people manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things. They don't want to own and buy things that we do want to own. And Other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board.\nAnd I guess, we'll open for questions now.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nYes. Thanks, Jamie. Let's go ahead and open up for questions.",

    "content": "Q2 2022 JPMorgan Chase & Co Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2022 JPMorgan Chase & Co Earnings Call\n\nJPMNYSEJUL 14, 8:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76, on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%.\nTouching on a few highlights. We had another quarter of strong performance in Markets which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is still quite healthy and net charge-offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, with average loans up 7% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter.\nOn Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $2.8 billion or 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex Markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and higher card acquisition costs. And Markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year-on-year.\nExpenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $657 million and reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook.\nOn to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. Let's start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters. The new 4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter. And the 4% G-SIB effective in 1Q '23 further raises this requirement to 12.5%.\nAt Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB to be higher and made it clear that in the near term, share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than expected, we have paused buybacks for the near term.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any access over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities. We have a long established track record of balance sheet discipline across the company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this discipline.\nTurning to this quarter's results. You can see that our CET1 ratio of 12.2% and is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. RWA was down approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk RWA from the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio.\nNow let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me touch on what we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the U.S. consumer.\nSpend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up 15% year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments. Notably, the average consumer is spending 35% more year-on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories. At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending, including in the lower income segments, with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year-on-year overall.\nAnd with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started, though cash buffers still remain elevated. With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion, which was down 1% year-on-year.\nIn Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits. Deposits were up 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. And client investment assets were down 7% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows.\nHome Lending revenue was down 26% year-on-year as the rate environment drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads, partially offset by higher net servicing revenue. And mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%.\nMoving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income, largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16% and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion, down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates while loans were up 2%.\nExpenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year-on-year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses.\nIn terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million year-on-year, driven by card, and a reserve build of $150 million in card driven by loan growth.\nNext to CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million with about $345 million reflected in payments and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue.\nInvestment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 61% year-on-year or down 53%, excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were down 54% versus an all-time record quarter last year. We maintained our #1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 28%, reflecting a decline in announced activity which started in the first quarter.\nThe volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses. Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 million was up 79% versus the prior year, driven by gains on mark-to-market hedges as well as higher loan balances.\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year-on-year in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year. In fixed income, elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise, most notably in currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by credit unsecuritized products in a challenging spread environment. In Equity Markets, we had a strong second quarter. And again, increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening. Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year or up 25% excluding the markdowns on equity investments. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by higher rates. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion were up 3% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation.\nMoving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $788 million was down 32%, driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenue-related expenses.\nDeposits were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, driven by migration of nonoperating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, which we expect to continue given the current rate environment. Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6%, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, Credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth, while net charge-offs remain historically low.\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins, partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year.\nIn addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisor teams, technology and asset management as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses.\nFor the quarter, net long-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, down 8% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, were predominantly driven by lower market levels, partially offset by net long-term inflows. And finally, loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter while deposits were down 7% sequentially, driven by seasonal client tax payments.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII was $324 million, up $1.3 billion, predominantly due to the impact of higher rates. And expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million year-on-year.\nNext, the outlook on Page 9. You will recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex Markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now expect it to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year-end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion and the card net charge-off rate to be less than 2% for 2022.\nSo to wrap up, the company's performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well positioned for a broad range of outcomes.\nWith that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\nStarting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other and CIB.\nRegarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM.\nOn Page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other and CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. End markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year.\nExpenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2% predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation in the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM.\nNet charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios.\nOn to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity.\nIn addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA.\nWhile, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead.\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8% predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression.\nDeposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year largely driven by flows in addition to market performance.\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%.\nMoving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%.\nTouching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses.\nNext, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year-on-year. We maintained our #1 rank with a wallet share of 8%. In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021.\nDebt underwriting fees were down 20% primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA.\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market.\nEquity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties.\nLet me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address.\nBecause this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VAR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings.\nPayments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses.\nMoving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35% driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity.\nExpenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP.\nC&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio.\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year.\nExpenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives.\nAnd in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion. AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year.\nNext, the outlook on Page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month.\nSo to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nLooking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nCFO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It's slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year.\nStarting with the fourth quarter on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 and revenue of $30.3 billion and were an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter.\nTouching on a few highlights. As we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM in markets. But we're also seeing positive indicators in Card as well as increasing revolver utilization in C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for investment banking particularly M&A as well as another good quarter in AWM.\nOn Page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 3% primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB market's NII. And NIR was down 1% largely driven by normalization in CIB markets and lower production revenue in Home Lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory.\nYou'll notice that we've added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR excluding markets as well as the third line of stand-alone markets total revenue, which, as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the company. We'll be keeping this format going forward, and you'll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook.\nIf you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII, excluding markets, is up 4%. NIR, excluding markets, is up 3%. And markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation. And credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases.\nLooking at the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36 and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18% excluding the reserve releases.\nAnd then on to reserve, Page 4. We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment.\nOn to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders including $1.9 billion of net repurchases.\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserve releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year-on-year and reflects lower production margins in Home Lending and higher acquisition costs in Card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter.\nDeposits were up 20% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. And client investment assets were up 22% year-on-year, but are evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined, credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of '19 with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q '19, though we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave.\nCard outstandings were up 5% year-on-year but remained down 8% versus 4Q '19. However, it's promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they've kept pace with 2019 growth rates.\nIn Home Lending, loans were down 1% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year-on-year. In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes.\nIn Auto, average loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year-on-year. So overall, loans, ex-PPP, were up 2% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by Card and Auto. And expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year-on-year on higher compensation as well as continued investments in technology and marketing.\nNext, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion.\nInvestment Banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year-on-year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our #1 rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%.\nIn advisory, we were up 86%, and it was the third consecutive all-time record quarter benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically from midsized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leveraged loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs.\nMoving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7% driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed income was down 16% year-on-year, reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities.\nEquity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue as continued strength in prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% and an all-time record.\nIt was a particularly strong year for both Investment Banking and Markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in Investment Banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust.\nPayments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year or up 7%, excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits largely offset by deposit margin compression. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year-on-year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year-on-year predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume-related and legal expenses. And credit costs were a net benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront.\nMoving to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year-on-year on record Investment Banking revenue driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition-related financing. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses.\nDeposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4%, ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1% with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 2 basis points.\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution fees.\nFor the quarter, net long-term inflows were $34 billion. And for the full year, were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record $164 billion. $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 15% sequentially.\nTurning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year-on-year. NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year-on-year.\nSo with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it's important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook.\nTurning to Page 11. What stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve build and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021.\nIf you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-Markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and [card] that we've discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth, ex-Markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB markets as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021.\nSo when you look across the company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the JPMorgan Chase platform.\nSo turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we're prepared for the long term.\nOn the left-hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural. And while the growth of 2% is modest over the 2-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward.\nThen the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from Investment Banking, Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance.\nAnd remember, we've seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So don't assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets in fee will it goes one way and AUM grows the opposite way.\nAnd then this bar also includes volume-related noncomp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they're offset with revenue gross-ups.\nThen the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we've been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our long-standing priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right-hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we've often discussed.\nWe're continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we've broadened to include tech adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition, the tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics, AI as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers.\nAnd what's really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms, and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns.\nSo over the next few pages, let's double-click into some of these investment areas to see what we're doing starting with examples of marketing and distribution on Page 13. We've expanded our reach across the U.S. and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our Commercial Bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the U.K. with Chase U.K., where we've seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall.\nWe continue to hire bankers and advisers in Investment Banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share.\nAnd as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the company. So we're not making short-term claims about share outcome causality. But as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the company.\nTurning to Page 14. In addition to all of our distribution investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over $12 billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend.\nIt's important to understand what's in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future.\nOn the left-hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture, data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it, attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills. And a product operating model, which is obviously a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment.\nMoving to the right-hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products. We believe it's critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we're attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying.\nAnd so a few examples of that. On the retail side, we've been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase My Home and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase U.K. launch.\nOn the wholesale side, we continue to innovate on our execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onex and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page.\nSo taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we're the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale.\nWith that, let's talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on Page 15. As you'll remember from Daniel's comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implies and the expectation that Card revolve rates will increase.\nBut the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher, and we realized business growth driven by our investments.\nSo let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve. Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625 basis point hikes over the next 3 years.\nAssuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term.\nIn this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve and more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII, but for the performance of the company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that.\nIn markets and banking, we feel good about the share we've taken, and there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post COVID revenue normalization.\nIn our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021 and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels.\nAs we've been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moment of the pandemic was the lower level of Card revolve even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth from the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances.\nBut there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term prepandemic averages resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case. Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside.\nAnd then let's touch on inflation for a second, which is obviously increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside.\nAnd while it's not on the page, another key driver is capital, where even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% G-SIB bucket which equates to a 1% increase from G-SIB in the central case. Although as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024.\nThis is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxy by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release combined represent two full G-SIB buckets. So in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we've assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next 1 to 2 years, we expect to earn modestly below that target.\nIn light of all that, let's talk about near-term guidance on Page 16. We expect NII, excluding Markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we've previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of Markets' NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral.\nLooking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors. Rates. With the market implied suggesting approximately 3 hikes later this year and the reason steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we've shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition.\nAnd as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EAR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what's happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive.\nThen balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels. And also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP.\nSo while we do expect NII to increase year-on-year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII generating capacity of the company.\nTurning to Page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of subtarget returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest and we're not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year-on-year or 8%.\nAnd before we go into the breakdown, it's worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories.\nSo starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses as well as higher noncomp expense with the resumption of T&E. Then volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and noncomp.\nFrom a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on noncomp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower Auto lease depreciation.\nAnd most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which I would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier.\nAs I wrap up, it's another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the company.\nSo in closing, on Page 18, we're happy with what we've been able to achieve over the last 2 years. Not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we've never felt better about the company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape.\nSo with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.",

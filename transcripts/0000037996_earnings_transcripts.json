At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Chief Investor Relations Officer.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director-Investor Relations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Layla, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; Sherry House, CFO; Andrew Frick, President, Ford Blue and Model e; and Kumar Galhotra, Chief Operating Officer.\nJoining us for Q&A will be Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit and Steve Croley, Chief Policy Officer and General Counsel. Also with us is Alicia Boler Davis, President of Ford Pro. Jim will give a high-level overview followed by Kumar on industrial progress, Andrew on market dynamics, and Sherry on our financial review and guidance. We'll be referencing non-GAAP measures today. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck.\nYou can find the deck at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ. The most significant risk factors are included on Page 20 of our deck. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. company, EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis.\nUpcoming IR engagements include Andrew Frick at the Scotia Bank Conference in Toronto on November 18 and Sherry House at the Barclays Conference in New York on November 19. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Duncan Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Lynn. Before I get started on earnings, I wanted to welcome Alicia Boler Davis to our team and to all of you. Her leadership is critical as we build our incredible powerhouse, Ford Pro into a durable products, software, services powerhouse. Alicia will cover Pro starting on our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to thank the Ford team as well as our suppliers and all of our dealers for delivering a very strong quarter.\nWe not only solidly beat expectations but our underlying performance has us on track to raise our full year 2025 EBIT guidance, if it weren't for the impact of the Novelis fire in Oswego, New York. Sherry will provide details of the financial impact of the Novelis fire, and I'm very pleased with our team's swift and decisive response to this challenge. We immediately mobilized a dedicated crisis team who worked around the clock with Novelis to secure alternative aluminum sources for our operational lines and accelerate the plant's recovery.\nSeveral top leaders and I personally visited the site to support all of these efforts. In addition, we are adding up to 1,000 new jobs to increase F-Series production to recover lost volume and fulfill strong customer demand. We have made substantial progress in a very short time frame in both reducing the 2025 impact and putting in place an exciting recovery plan for next year.\nTurning to our results. Our Ford+ plan delivered a record $50.5 billion in revenue and $2.6 billion in adjusted EBIT. Once again, we made meaningful progress in cost and quality, thanks to the disciplined execution of our industrial team. Kumar will share more details. I'd like to thank President Trump and his team for the recent tariff policy developments, which are favorable to Ford as the most American auto manufacturer.\n[ Credit-based ] on our large U.S. manufacturing volume will allow us to offset tariffs on imported auto parts we need for our strong American production and manufacturing base. In addition, tariffs leveling the playing field for those imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks is a positive for Ford because we are no longer disadvantaged for building every single one of our Super Duties here in the United States. We also continue to watch [ for LEAF ] from tailpipe emissions, which may come as soon as the end of this year. Federal legislation has already scaled back California ZEV rules, and we anticipate a meaningful reduction in federal requirements next year.\nWe are adjusting our product mix accordingly. Our Ford+ plan is designed to win in the market. Among 4 key trends. Markets are more regional now. We all need tailored strategies. Customers are more fragmented between retail and commercial. This requires unique services and digital solutions for both. The competition is getting tougher, namely the Chinese OEMs are expanding globally, and the industry faces lower returns due to the EV overcapacity and global pressures. Thankfully, our strategy plays to our strengths at Ford, iconic [ work ] vehicles, passion products like Mustang and the off-road franchises like Bronco and Raptor. We're also prioritizing hybrids across our lineup, including the development of extended range hybrid options.\nIn the near term, I believe EV adoption will now only be about 5% of the U.S. market, but this is going to grow, especially for affordable EV vehicles. We are well positioned for this with the universal EV platform, which underpins digitally advanced, very spacious and appealing products that start at around $30,000. This is not a distant plan. It's right around the corner for us at Ford. Sourcing is at 95% complete now. We are testing vehicles.\nWe'll begin installing equipment in Louisville for the UAV later this year, and we are on track to start introduction of our LFP cells at Marshall, Michigan plant later this year. To compete, we need innovation and hyper cost efficiency. In this capital-intensive environment, smart partnerships will be essential to us. And our largest near-term opportunity is closing that cost gap and achieving world-class quality. Kumar?\n\nKumar Galhotra\n\nThank you, Jim. Our industrial platform is delivering tangible progress in quality, cost and modernization. Improving quality is the single biggest driver to close our cost gap, better quality lowers warranty expense and reduces recalls. 4 key elements are essential for sustainable warranty cost reduction: Seamless launch execution, minimal defects, greater reliability and durability and time. You need time to clear the car part of all the issues. .\nIt all starts with a clean launch, a bad launch creates years of warranty and recall problems. Over the past 2 years, we have radically improved our launch quality. We are on track for best-in-class performance across 6 nameplates with 3 more nameplates in the top quartile. This is based on JD Power Warranty Analytics data. Also, Ford was the most awarded brand in JD Power 2025 U.S. Initial Quality study. We're also catching defects earlier in the process, through rigorous engineering reviews where leaders sign off to ensure accountability and fixes happen in real time.\nOur next focus is on long-term reliability and durability. We've identified the specific parts and systems needed to achieve industry-leading reliability. To get there, we've implemented a new powertrain testing regimen that is up to 7x longer than before. It includes extreme use cases that help us find issues we previously only found years after the vehicle was in the field. Now it takes time for these improvements to improve our recall numbers as older models have to work their way out of the system, but we're already seeing our recall costs shift towards more aged vehicles.\nAnd since the peak recall period is in years 3 to 5, we expect a meaningful improvement soon. On cost, we delivered another quarter of year-over-year improvement and are on track for a net $1 billion improvement this year, excluding the impact of tariffs. Lower material costs, trade and duty efficiency and lower warranty contributed to this. This is the result of a fundamental change in our team's operational DNA. We have dedicated work streams reducing the cost of parts, optimizing repair times and transforming how we negotiate with our suppliers.\nWe're also modernizing our facilities and IT to unlock the next level of efficiency. We are systemically deploying AI across the entire industrial system. For example, we have significantly improved [ CAD ] loading times to less than a minute. And we have added 900 AI-powered cameras across our plants to detect quality issues at the source and help us mitigate supply disruptions. Thank you. Now over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Frick\n\nPresident of Ford Blue & Ford Model e\n\nThank you, Kumar.\nI will start with Ford Pro, which is thriving due to our diverse vehicle lineup, service parts penetration and growth in our integrated software and services. Our specialized dealer network is a significant competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate. Dealers recognize the importance of customer uptime and they continue to invest, adding another 1,700 service bays and 500 mobile service vans over this past year. This makes Ford the largest mobile fleet in the U.S., providing a structural advantage and brand differentiation for both Pro and retail customers.\nWe have intentionally diversified our revenue streams for more durable profits. For example, Softness in government sales this year was offset by strength in small to medium businesses or SMB. Our channel mix is now well balanced across large corporations, SMBs and government and rental fleets. In software, Pro's paid subscriptions grew 8% to 818,000 subscribers, and we're also seeing growth in our ARPU and attach rates.\nThis is producing a flywheel effect. For example, customers who subscribe to our fleet software have a service parts capture rate up to 20 points higher, which also helps us win sales from new competitors in multi-make fleets. There is upside to software via strategic partnerships. Our new partnership with ServiceTitan, the largest software provider to the trades is a notable example of this. We are embedding our real-time vehicle data directly into their workflow, combining the insights from Ford Pro's data services with Service Titans Fleet Pro software for a real-time view of fleet vehicle data.\nCustomers will be able to manage vehicle maintenance, streamline services and simplify repairs. Now in our home market, industry conditions were strong this quarter with a SAAR of 17 million and positive pricing. Our total U.S. share grew to 12.8% with growth outpacing the industry despite our phaseout of the Edge, driven by key products like F-150, Bronco, Explorer and Expedition. In fact, the all new Expedition is red hot, gaining over 3 points of segment share with 75% of customers choosing high-end trims like Tremor, and we continue to lead the hybrid truck market with about 70% share.\nLastly, our ample inventory does position us for a strong fourth quarter and helps to insulate our retail sales from the near-term impact of Novelis. We will end this year with retail stock levels between 55 to 59 days supply, with gross stock down 11%. As we look at 2026, even with our net recovery, we forecast being down roughly another 6% to about 520,000 units of gross stock. A disciplined approach yet still leaving us headroom to look for more market opportunities. Now I'd like to turn it over to Sherry.\n\nSherry House\n\nCFO, Lucid Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Ford continues to make great strides in our journey to build a higher growth, higher margin, more capital efficient and durable business. and that progress is evident in our ongoing performance. In the third quarter, our strong product lineup drove global revenue growth of over 9%, roughly 1.5x faster than our growth in wholesales, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of $2.6 billion, flat with the prior year despite absorbing a net tariff headwind of $700 million.\nThe durability of our business is strengthening. Over the past 3 years, total company EBIT from software and physical services has grown by over 20%, and our revenue growth is diversified across regions, segments, channels, in software and physical services. Furthermore, our industrial system has delivered on their commitment to consistently deliver cost improvements, excluding the impact of tariffs.\nTotal company adjusted free cash flow was strong at $4.3 billion in the third quarter with $5.7 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with nearly $33 billion in cash and $54 billion in liquidity. Our balance sheet is a competitive advantage. We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and we are focused on the areas driving expected profitable growth, such as our UAW platform launching in 2027. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating and returning capital to shareholders.\nToday, we announced the declaration of our fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on December 1 to shareholders of record on November 7. Now turning to the segments. Ford Pro delivered another solid quarter. Revenue was $17.4 billion, and EBIT was $2 billion, with a robust double-digit margin. Revenue and volume grew by 11% and 9%, respectively. Growth in EBIT was driven by volume and continued improvement in warranty and material cost, partially offset by tariff impacts and pricing normalization in Europe and North America.\nFord Model e delivered both revenue and volume growth driven by new product introductions in Europe. EBIT losses increased due to lower net pricing and an increase in spending on our next-generation vehicles. Let me give you additional color on Model e.\nYear-to-date, Model e is at a $3.6 billion loss, roughly $3 billion of this is from our first-generation products, Mach-E, Lightning, Puma, Explorer and Capri. The balance is investment in our next-generation vehicles, including our [ UAV ] platform. The only practical way to improve the profitability of our Gen 1 vehicles is through one of the more of the following: pricing, new cost reductions and improved fixed cost leverage.\nGiven current industry trends, it's clear, scaling fixed cost is a challenge for most of the industry. You can see this in a multitude of recent program cancellations and charges globally. We've been proactive. Over 2 years ago, we reduced our planned battery capacity by 35%. In last year, we canceled our 3-row program, making room for additional commercial vehicle volumes. Clearly, near-term U.S. customer and market realities for EVs continue to evolve.\nWe will have more to share about how we are adapting to these changes at a later date. Ford Blue achieved EBIT of $1.5 billion, with revenue growth exceeding the rate of wholesale unit growth, highlighting the strength of our diverse product lineup. Higher costs were driven by tariffs which muted progress in warranty. Adverse exchange was also a headwind driven by a weaker U.S. dollar against the euro and Thai baht.\nFord Credit delivered over $600 million of [ EBT ], up 16%, reflecting improved financing margin. Ford Credit also made a $350 million distribution. We continue to originate a high-quality book with U.S. retail and lease FICO scores, again exceeding 750 for the quarter. So let me turn to our 2025 outlook.\nExcluding Novelis, our underlying business continues to perform well. In fact, we are tracking at the high end of the adjusted EBIT guidance range we provided in February of between $7 billion and $8.5 billion. This original guidance was provided before tariffs, which we have fully absorbed. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is trending better than the guidance we provided in July of between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. Between 2025 and 2026, we expect Novelis to be a headwind of $1 billion or less.\nFor 2025, we expect an adjusted EBIT headwind of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the fourth quarter for Novelis. And we currently have line of sight to mitigate at least $1 billion in 2026, and we are working to improve the situation further. We also expect an adjusted free cash flow headwind of $2 billion to $3 billion in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind the production disruptions result in an oversized short-term impact on our working capital, which will reverse next year.\nGiven the recent announcements by the administration, we now expect tariffs will be a $1 billion net headwind for 2025, down from $2 billion. This brings our updated adjusted EBIT guidance for 2025 to between $6 billion to $6.5 billion, with adjusted free cash flow of between $2 billion and $3 billion. Our full year outlook also assumes U.S. industry SAAR of about 16.8 million units, U.S. industry pricing of about 0.5% and a net cost improvement of $1 billion, excluding the impact of tariffs; and lastly, capital expenditures of about $9 billion.\nTurning to 2026. While it's premature to give guidance, I want to share some puts and takes as you think about the industry and Ford. First, we have line of sight to recover at least $1 billion related to Novelis. For tariffs, we expect a net full year impact similar to 2025. For compliance, the evolving global emissions landscape is expected to eliminate 2026 compliance headwinds, thereby unlocking opportunities to optimize our mix of ICE, hybrids and EVs and reduced reliance on credits. And for cost, we plan to deliver another $1 billion of cost improvements across our industrial system, which will be redeployed to strategic, accretive ICE and hybrid cycle plan actions.\nAdditionally, [ UAB ] platform spending will continue to increase as we ramp our Marshall LFP battery plant and change over to the Louisville Assembly plant ahead of 2027 launch. Before we go to Q&A, let me end with this. Our underlying business is strong. And importantly, we are starting to more consistently execute and deliver our Ford+ plan. I'll now turn the call over to the operator.",

My name is Layla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn AntipasTyson, Chief Investor Relations Officer.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director-Investor Relations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Layla. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; Sherry House, CFO; and Kumar Galhotra, Chief Operating Officer. Joining us for Q&A will be John Lawler, Vice Chair; Andrew Frick, President Ford Blue and Model e and Interim Head of Ford Pro; Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit; and Steve Corley, Chief Policy Officer and General Counsel.\nToday's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com.\nOur discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis.\nLastly, I want to call out 2 near-term IR engagements. May 28, John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Daniel Roeska at the Bernstein Annual Strategic Decisions Conference. Sherry House will also attend. June 4, Sherry House will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Joe Spak at the UBS Auto and Auto Tech Conference.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Duncan Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Lynn, and thanks to all of you for joining. I'm going to give you an update on the state of the business and on tariffs. Kumar is going to take you through our cost and quality progress as well as some of our mitigation or tariffs and then Sherry is going to take you through the financial performance and guidance, and hopefully, we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.\nOur underlying business continues to gain traction and perform well. We beat our original expectation for the quarter and before tariff-related impacts, we are on track and within our original full year guidance range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion in EBIT. We had our best first quarter U.S. pickup sales in over 20 years, and we delivered sequential share growth in our home market.\nAdditionally, we saw smooth execution of several major product launches in the quarter around the globe, and we continue to deliver progress against our cost and quality targets.\nOn tariffs, Ford supports the administration's goal to strengthen the U.S. economy by growing American manufacturing. And we also support a level playing field globally for domestic and foreign OEMs. We also appreciate the ongoing cooperation we've had with the administration. As America's largest auto manufacturer, our engagement with Washington is helping U.S. policymakers better understand their proposed policy changes would impact our industry and, of course, our communities.\nLast year, we assembled over 300,000 more vehicles in the U.S. than our closest competitor. That includes 100% of all our full-size trucks. While some OEMs have open capacity in the U.S. that will partially match our footprint advantage, they have to absorb higher costs, invest capital, and that will take time. It's not as simple as just assembling more vehicles in the U.S. OEMs must also balance customer affordability, and -- which means the ability to import parts tariff free.\nBased on what we know now, our expectations of how certain details will resolve around tariffs, we have estimated the gross impact of tariffs for full year total company EBIT of $2.5 billion and a net impact of $1.5 billion. It's still too early to fully understand our competitors' responses to these tariffs. It's also early to gauge the related market dynamics, including the potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and the impact of Ford's domestic manufacturing advantages. And as a result, we decided to suspend our guidance.\nIt's clear, however, than in this new environment, in which automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage. And boy, is that true for Ford. It puts us in the pole position plus we have the largest value unlock even beyond that, because of our improving cost and quality opportunities. Kumar?\n\nKumar Galhotra\n\nThank you, Jim. Before I walk everyone through how we are managing the business during this evolving policy landscape, I want to quickly highlight the progress we're making on cost and quality. Our industrial platform continues to deliver progress against our targets, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion in net cost reductions this year excluding the impact of changes in tariff policy.\nWe're also closing our competitive cost gap and efficiently leveraging our U.S. footprint as a competitive advantage. We're improving our production stability, and we're working to strengthen our supply base.\nWe are achieving all this by shifting our focus to the key process inputs, which, in turn, deliver the desired outputs and those desired outputs of course, are lower cost and better quality. Let me give you a few examples of what I mean by inputs in these processes.\nFor example, we are doing thorough readiness assessments of every workstation in our assembly plants ahead of every launch. We are building a continuous pipeline of cost and quality improvement ideas. So not only are we executing this quarter, we have a very clear pipeline for the next quarter and the quarter after that. We're doing regress implant audits to prevent defects from reaching our customers. We have created a comprehensive system of leading metrics that provide us early warnings if any of these outputs are at risk.\nSo here are the results. We're on track to deliver year-over-year warranty savings. The warranty spikes during launch are now at industry-leading levels. We are on track to deliver greater than 10% improvement in repairs per thousand, both for 0 months in service and 3 months in service for 25 vehicles. Ford and Lincoln were the most improved brands in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study.\nDuring our launches in the first quarter, we lost 0 vehicles versus our launch acceleration curves. And we deployed 9.5 million OTAs in the first quarter to address customer concerns. We're not just improving cost and quality, the team is also in the trenches taking actions to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business. In fact, their actions lowered the potential first quarter financial impact by nearly 35%.\nHere are some of the key actions we took. Vehicles shipped to Canada from Mexico via the U.S. are now transported on bonded carriers, so they aren't subject to U.S. tariffs. We've done the same for parts that merely passed through the United States. We are assessing where there are near-term resourcing actions to increase U.S. content in our vehicles. We have stopped exporting vehicles to China. But we do continue to leverage China as a vehicle export hub to regions like ASEAN, Australia, South America and others where trade relations remain favorable.\nLooking ahead, even though nearly 80% of our parts that we use in the U.S., are USMCA compliant, we are looking for opportunities where it makes sense to develop local supply chains. Relative to adding manufacturing capacity in the U.S., for Ford, this is a continuation, not a course correction. Since 2020, we have invested $50 billion in manufacturing capacity and we have a lot of investments in flight, including manufacturing and battery capacity in Tennessee, battery capacity in Kentucky and Michigan and manufacturing capacity in Ohio. Thanks. Sherry, over to you.\n\nSherry House\n\nCFO, Lucid Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kumar, and thank you to the team members supporting our first quarter product launches as well as those helping us mitigate the financial impact of tariffs. We are transforming Ford into a higher growth, higher margin, more capital-efficient and more durable business.\nThis was evident in our first quarter results. We delivered $1 billion in EBIT exceeding our expectation of roughly breakeven for the quarter, driven by the team's continued progress on cost and strong net pricing in North America. When excluding the nearly $200 million impact of tariffs, this was our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost improvement.\nYou'll recall that during the first quarter, we had planned downtime at several plants, most notably Kentucky Truck plant to support product launches in the rebalancing of U.S. dealer inventory. As expected, this resulted in lower wholesales, which were down 7%, and -- in revenue of $41 billion, which was down 5%. The product launches were successful. And in March, we launched new versions of the Expedition and Navigator in North America, and an all-electric version of Puma in Europe. We also began production of the new Ranger Logan hybrid EV, which goes on sale in Europe and Australia during the second quarter.\nNow on to a few highlights from the segments. Ford Pro continues to be a real competitive advantage. In for Pro showed its resilience by delivering a solid quarter despite the planned downtime at Kentucky truck plant and a normalization in industry pricing in more commoditized areas like delivery bands and daily rental.\nDemand for key products like Super Duty chassis cabs in transit wagons remains strong. In Europe, Pro grew its commercial brand leadership on the strength of Transit Custom and Ranger. And in North America, Pro is far and away the segment leader with over 40% share of the U.S. Class 17 truck and van market.\nPro continues to serve its customers in the way that they want to be served. In addition to adding new service elite base, mobile bands are driving growth in customer paid mobile repair orders, which are now 7% of all customer paid repair orders.\nOn the software side, Pro's paid subscriptions, which deliver better than 50% gross margin rose to $675,000, up 20% from a year ago. With outsized growth in higher value services like fleet telematics, driving 40% growth in average revenue per unit. Ford Model e remains focused on improving gross margin and exercising capital discipline as our battery investment scale and we deliver next-generation products that will generate profitable future growth. Model e continues to scale, and it more than doubled its first quarter wholesale volumes, driven by the recent launches of Explore, Capri, and Puma Gen-e in Europe.\nModel e's U.S. retail sales grew 15% in the quarter, enabled in part by the success of the U.S. Ford Power Promise campaign, which provides customers a home charger in standard installation. The campaign is currently seen an attach rate of 34%. Given the campaign's success, it is now being offered in Canada and in Europe.\nFord Blue earned a modest profit, reflecting the expected volume decline in adverse exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that impacted key markets like Canada and Australia, offset partially by higher net pricing in North America. Blue continues to benefit from disciplined revenue management across the portfolio, along with cost reduction work that Kumar highlighted. Blue's international operations were once again collectively profitable.\nIconic nameplates such as F-Series and Bronco continue to lead their respective segments and Bronco sales grew 35%. Blue continues to see growing customer demand for its hybrids. In fact, our hybrid mix of global sales increased 250 basis points. Additionally, based on early sales data, the newly launched Expedition and Navigator have average transaction prices that are 18% and 23% higher than the outgoing model, respectively, and they are turning on dealer lots in less than 9 days.\nFord Credit delivered another solid quarter with EBT up significantly, reflecting its high-quality book of business, higher financing margin in higher net receivables. Also in the quarter, Ford Credit paid a $200 million distribution to the automotive company. First quarter auction values increased 3% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting low used car availability. Ford Credit also continues to grow its active commercial lines of credit, making it a strategic asset for our Ford Pro customers.\nNow on to cash flow and balance sheet. Free cash flow was a use of $1.5 billion, more than explained by unfavorable timing differences, net spending in changes in working capital. Our balance sheet is strong with over $27 billion in cash and over $45 billion in liquidity as of March 31 and -- and in April, we renewed our $18 billion corporate credit facilities for another year. As we have said repeatedly, strong liquidity provides us with the flexibility to manage in this very dynamic environment, the capacity to make consistent shareholder distributions and the optionality to invest in higher return growth opportunities that truly unlock value.\nTo that end, consistent with our commitment to return 40% to 50% of trailing free cash flow to shareholders, last week, we declared a regular second quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on June 2 to shareholders of record on May 12.\nWe -- so let's turn to our 2025 outlook. I am pleased with the progress the team has made on cost and quality. You saw green shoots of this in the first quarter, and we are on track to deliver $1 billion in net cost improvement, excluding tariffs this year. Excluding the impact of tariffs, we are within our previous EBIT guidance range of $7 billion to $8.5 billion.\nBased on what the company knows now and our expectation of how certain details and changes will be resolved related to tariffs, we estimate a gross adverse EBIT impact of $2.5 billion and a net adverse EBIT impact of about $1.5 billion for full year 2025.\nGiven material tariff-related near-term risks and the potential range of outcomes, we are suspending guidance for full year 2025. I -- these near-term risks include, among other things: industry-wide supply chain disruption impacting production, future or increased tariffs in the U.S., changes in the implementation of tariffs, including tariff offsets, retaliatory tariffs and other restrictions by other governments in the potential related market caps and finally, policy uncertainties associated with tax and emissions policy. We will provide an update on guidance during the Q2 earnings call.\nBefore we go to Q&A, let me wrap with this. Our underlying performance, excluding tariffs, is in line with our original targets. Our U.S. footprint is a competitive advantage as the industry navigates the impact of tariffs and our strong balance sheet provides flexibility to continue to invest in profitable growth while managing industry dynamics.\nThank you. Back to you, operator.",

Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone. We appreciate that you're joining us. I want to start by welcoming Sherry House to our first earnings call as our incoming CFO, and I want to thank John Lawler as he transitions to our Vice Chair. Last year was a year of progress in key areas, building on our fundamentals at Ford. Our global revenue reached an all-time record at the company of $185 billion. This was our fourth consecutive year of top-line growth driven by some of the strongest and most durable franchises in our industry. Ford is the undisputed leader of pickup trucks in our industry. The F-Series is once again America's best-selling pickup and the best-selling vehicle of any kind. The Ranger has grown into a strong global franchise for us. It's key to our profitability in many markets around the world at Ford.\nBy the way, Ranger won North America Truck of the Year. That's the fifth time in a row Ford has won that award. Hybrid trucks are a key growth area for us. It's not what you think about when you think of hybrids, but this non-traditional channel is allowing us to capture the lion's share of revenue and command pricing power within the pickup truck market with unique features like Pro Power Onboard. Vans are another stronghold globally for us with our best-selling Transit family. The story is no different for Pro as a whole. Our commercial business is focused on unit sales and series mix to maximize revenue, and last year we really saw that: a sizable growth and mix of profitable high-series Super Duties, and Transit wagon.\nAt the same time, Pro is building something new: recurring revenue streams through our software and physical services business. Pro software subscriptions rose 27% to nearly 650,000 subscriptions last year. Telematics software grew 100%. Mobile service units increased 57%. The stickiness of that ecosystem of services is increasing. The second half of last year, 25% of all of our brand-new telematics customers in North America purchased additional software, including dash cams and fleet management software. With BlueCruise, equipped units have now in operations and now more than doubled in the last year to just under 700,000 vehicles and since launch, our customers have now driven over 300 million miles hands-free. So you can see our relationship with our customers no longer ends at the point of sale or financing. We're starting to build lasting relationships and creating new avenues for recurring growth at Ford.\nLast year, Ford had the highest share of revenue among all brands in our home market, the US. But the key for us is matching this revenue growth with improved execution and discipline on cost and quality. We're working differently, and it's starting to show. We've upgraded talent throughout our industrial system. We brought in industry's best third-party experts to inspect and validate our findings. We're identifying best practices to attack our operational issues. We're quantifying the upside, and most importantly, we're bringing home the savings. We're changing our culture to be more focused on quality and with countable measures for all of our engineering teams and leadership. These changes produce green shoots, delivering about a $500 million of net cost reductions in last year's second half. This is, frankly, a small down payment on the work to be done at Ford.\nWe're focused on closing our competitive cost gap over the next few years and lastly, we continue to monitor and adapt to the changing market conditions, which last year unfolded about what we thought. The EV market, we continue to see new models launch, increased competition with increased pricing pressure. On hybrids, we continue to see the market grow aggressively, but now in diverse markets like truck customers who are learning that a hybrid can also mean uncompromised towing, torque, and payload, and other performance advantages, including fuel economy. In the ICE market, the industry's inventories and pricing have normalized. We also see the Chinese OEMs continue to expand and be a major force in our industry. Their operational fitness is incredible. Their supply chains are now expanding globally, and they're increasing their exports around the world. So let's talk about this year.\nWe expect the company's Adjusted EBIT of $7 billion to $8.5 billion range. Sherry's going to get into the details. We want to be clear, though, that our guidance has not factored in impacts from changes in policy by the current administration. That said, from an operational standpoint, we believe a few weeks of tariffs are manageable given the rate and flow of our products. As everyone is aware, we're already seeing changes in trade policy, and we expect changes in tax policy like the IRA and emissions policy, CO2, that could be very consequential for our industry. At this early point, I want to emphasize a few things. There's no question the tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the US.\nJobs as well as the entire value system in our industry. Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers. We said that. We believe, based on our conversations in DC with the Trump administration and congressional leaders, that they are committed to strengthening, not weakening, our nation's auto industry. That is certainly our expectation. We look forward to working with our leaders to make sure that that becomes a reality because they understand and appreciate how vital our industry is to jobs, the economy, our national security, and the communities across our country. As America's leading auto producer and the leading exporter of automobiles, we applaud the administration for the agreement they announced with Mexico and Canada on Monday, and we're closely monitoring the situation in China. There is a fundamental transformation happening in the backdrop of these policy changes in our industry globally.\nOf course, the overall tariff and trade situation, the growing importance of digital vehicles, the Chinese OEMs growing to become a global reality, these dynamics will all play out for some time to come but Ford controls its future. While we are certainly operating in interesting times, at the end of the day, we control our destiny. Our products and services are compelling and get even stronger this year with great new launches like the Expedition, the Navigator, the all-new electric Puma, as well as Ford Pro's service offerings. We will match that potent revenue power with real progress on cost.\nTo realize this multi-billion-dollar upside opportunity on cost, we will stay focused on the following areas: faster identification of defects and issues in the field, deploying dedicated teams into our supply base to help them improve key manufacturing disciplines to improve their part quality to us, holding suppliers accountable when they send us defects, reducing complexity to eliminate waste, and a dramatic increase in our OTA capability. We performed nine million over-the-air updates in Fourth Quarter alone. 80% of those were focused on addressing customers' concerns and warranty. We're enhancing our software development process. For example, more upfront experts reviewing coding, not just ours, but our suppliers, to catch potential issues early. We're continuing to integrate AI, data analytics, and other tools and processes to further improve our manufacturing efficiency. Early input metrics provide us confidence in our 2025 cost reduction target.\nWe already have over $1 billion of product design cost reduction ideas to be implemented this year. We have fewer lost units during our launches. The improvement in the number of days from warranty defect and field fix is an encouraging sign for us in warranty. We're seeing an 18% improvement in the quality of our vehicles leaving our facilities for the 25 model-year launches and we're increasing the number of supplier technical assistance site visits for critical suppliers. I want to touch on our EV strategy since it's so critical for any car company. We're on course. We're deep in the development of our next generation of vehicles that we believe will be affordable, high volume, and great for our business. On the US retail side, the sweet spot that has emerged is small and medium-sized trucks and utilities.\nThese vehicles' use case fits perfectly for EVs, daily commuters well-suited as a second vehicle in the household. They require smaller, much lower-cost batteries. These vehicles can be offered at lower prices to help adoption of EVs for the customers who really appreciate their lower operating costs. But for larger retail electric vehicles, the economics are unresolvable. These customers have very demanding use cases for an electric vehicle. They tow, they go off-road, they take long road trips. These vehicles have worse aerodynamics, and they're very heavy, which means very large and expensive batteries. Retail customers have shown that they will not pay any premium for these large EVs, making them a really tough business case given the expense in the batteries. For Ford, our commercial customers do show potential for large EVs.\nThey're willing to pay a premium over ICE because they can really measure the TCO advantages of EV, and they can live with depot charging. They don't have the same range anxiety that retail customers have. Profitability for these larger family haulers that take long trips will be more frequently occurred through partial electric options. Yes, PHEV, but especially hybrid and EREVs that on one tank of gas can get over 700 miles of range but still drive most miles all electric. Ford will be developing flexible body-on-frame and unit body platforms that will be designed for these multi-energy powertrains that are needed given the realities of customer affordability and range requirements. We are in the heart of our transformation of Ford. My optimism comes from our improved execution and our commitment to delivering on Ford+, creating a more dynamic, more capital-efficient, higher-margin company.\nNow, I'd like to hand it over to Sherry to walk you through last year's operating performance and an outlook for this year.\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Jim, and greetings to everyone on the call with us today. We really appreciate you taking the time to get a current update on the business. Before I get started, I want to personally thank John Lawler, Jim, and the entire Ford team for their incredible support over the last several months as I've ramped up in this new role. I'm very excited for the opportunity, and I'm especially excited for the future of Ford. 2024 was another important year for us as we continue to execute against the Ford+ plan. We finished the year with global wholesales up 1% to 4.5 million units, supported by growth in Ford Pro. Revenue increased 5% to $185 billion, and we delivered 11 consecutive quarters of top-line growth.\nOur strategic decision to offer retail and commercial customers freedom of choice through a compelling portfolio of products continues to pay off. We delivered $10.2 billion in Adjusted EBIT with a margin of 5.5%. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $6.7 billion, and our cash conversion rate was 65%, above our target range of 50% to 60. Our balance sheet is strong, with more than $28 billion in cash and close to $47 billion in liquidity. We believe it's prudent to have extra cash on hand during this dynamic time in the industry, marked by evolving customer needs, regulations, and a fluid macro environment. Excess cash also provides us the opportunity to strategically pursue adjacencies and signature partnerships that would be accretive to our growth and ROIC.\nWe hold ourselves accountable to strong capital discipline as we continue to efficiently invest in our future with plans to consistently reward our shareholders with 40% to 50 of free cash flow. Over the past three years, we've paid out over $10 billion to our shareholders. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share, plus a supplemental dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on 3 March 2024 to shareholders of record on 18 February 2024. Now, let us take a closer look at our segment performance. Strong demand in Super Duty chassis cabs and Transit wagon helped to lift Ford Pro's revenue by 15% to $67 billion, while wholesales were up 9%. Full-year EBIT was $9 billion, with a margin of 13.5%. Software and physical services represented 13% of Pro's EBIT.\nFord Pro Intelligence continues to drive recurring, high-margin, non-cyclical revenue. Paid subscriptions, attachment rate, and monthly average revenue per unit were all up strongly in 2024. The Model e team, where I've been spending a lot of my time, did a tremendous job delivering $1.4 billion in cost reductions last year, net of a $100 million increase in spend to launch our new battery plants and next-gen EVs. This cost performance was particularly important given industry pricing pressure, which resulted in year-over-year reductions in revenue and wholesales of 35% and 9%, respectively. Model e remains focused on continuous improvements in gross margins and disciplined capital allocation that will drive profitable growth in the future. Ford Blue's full-year revenue was flat due to positive net pricing, which offset a 2% decline in wholesales driven by the discontinuation of low-margin products.\nEBIT was $5.3 billion, with a margin of 5.2%, and includes a positive impact of building stock in our home market. In 2024, our Blue investment strategy mirrored customer demand with significant investments targeted at the next generation of our most iconic brands, such as F-Series and Explorer, and is also focused on bringing multi-energy solutions, particularly hybrid powertrains, across a broader part of our product portfolio. Ford Credit generated earnings before taxes of $1.7 billion for the year. So let's turn to our 2025 outlook. For the full year, we expect company-Adjusted EBIT of $7 billion to 8.5 billion, adjusted free cash flow of $3.5 billion to 4.5 billion, and capital expenditures of $8 billion to 9 billion.\nRelative to tariffs, the precise impacts of new tariffs would depend on a number of secondary and tertiary effects, such as price elasticities, how our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers react, substitution effects, possible duty drawbacks, and so on. Other potential changes in policy, such as changes to the consumer tax credit or CTC, commercial and production tax credits or PTC, would also be harmful. However, the impacts of such changes are much smaller for Ford in 2025 than later years. For example, PTC will become a more meaningful benefit for us later this year with the launch of our BOSK battery factory. And for the longer term, 2027 and beyond, changes to these programs would be very material. Hence, we continue to stay in close contact with the administration to support a strong auto sector into the future. Our full-year outlook assumes headwinds related to market factors.\nWe're planning for lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending throughout the year. For Ford, we expect this will be partially offset by top-line growth from upcoming launches. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by about $1 billion of net cost reductions, primarily coming from lower warranty expense and material cost. Our team is aggressively working to deliver more than $1 billion, which would likely lift us to the higher end of our guidance range. We expect the majority of these savings to occur in H2 of the year. From a calendarization perspective, we expect our Q1 Adjusted EBIT to be roughly break-even. This sequential decline in EBIT versus Q4 2024 is more than explained by a reduction in wholesales and unfavorable mix, including the impact of launch activity at major US assembly plants, including Kentucky Truck and Michigan Assembly plants.\nOur plans to utilize Oakville for our next major truck launch will help us better optimize production stability during major launch periods, a benefit we highlighted to you when we announced the repurposing of that manufacturing facility. We expect a more normalized Adjusted EBIT in Q2, with a plan to hit our underlying EBIT level in H2, as cost improvements tied to lower material cost start to accrue to the bottom line. To help you better understand this calendarization and the levers for each quarter, we have included a full-year 2025 bridge for you in our earnings deck. Our segment outlook anticipates another strong year at Ford Pro, with EBIT of $7.5 billion to 8 billion at target margins.\nThe fundamentals of Ford Pro's business are strong, especially Super Duty chassis cabs and Transit wagon in North America, and the Transit family in Europe. We continue to grow our mix of profitability coming from software and physical services globally. We expect a loss of $5 billion to 5.5 billion for Ford Model e, holding losses stable year over year. While continued industry pricing pressure remains, we plan to materially increase our global volume, driven by the full-year impact of European launches, and we significantly increase investment in our battery facilities and next-generation products, which are just two years away. The team started the year with a strong pipeline of cost savings ideas, which, together with the launch of our BOSK battery JV later in 2025, enables meaningful savings through eligibility to production tax credit.\nFor Ford Blue, we expect EBIT of $3.5 to 4 billion, reflecting lower volume and unfavorable mix, driven by the non-repeat of last year's stock build and anticipated adverse exchange, partially offset by several cost reductions initiatives that are already underway. Cost remains our largest value unlock to achieve Blue's margin target. Lastly, Ford Credit EBT will be about $2 billion. Our performance in 2024 demonstrates the positive progress in our Ford+ plan, capital discipline, the right product portfolio, and consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders, customers, and employees. Importantly, I see us working differently as a company, evidenced by our second-half cost progress. We are carrying forward that higher level of discipline and execution into 2025, commensurate with our goal to deliver at least $1 billion of net cost reductions this year.\nWe're relentlessly working to make our business better, and we remain highly focused on improving both quality and cost. That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'd now like to open it up to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now move to our question and answer session. If you have joined via the webinar, please use the raise hand icon, which can be found on the bottom of your webinar application. If you have joined by phone, please dial star nine on your keypad to raise your hand. When you are called on, please unmute your line and ask your question. We will now pause a moment to assemble the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Wanted to double-click on your commentary first on calendarization of earnings throughout the year. In the first quarter, you have to assume, I think, something like a 25% volume decline to get to break-even. If you could just talk through that, what's the confidence of recovery in subsequent quarters? Is it volume? And then should we expect inventory to be fully right-sized by the end of the first quarter?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nOkay. So as I talked about for the year-over-year, you're really seeing the pricing come in and also the net cost improvements year-over-year. But when you go for just the first quarter, what you're seeing is largely the impact of wholesales that are coming down and the non-recurrence of a stock build that's happening. We also see adverse exchange, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey. So that's really what's happening in that particular quarter.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nDan, quarter-over-quarter, our wholesales are down almost 20%. Okay. So it's really clear what's going on: our launches. The question is, where are we on day supply for our growth stock? We're in good shape. We'll be in good shape after the first quarter, even actually gets leaner after the second quarter. I think we finished.\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThat's right. So we finished the year at about 620,000 growth units, and that came down about 5% in January. And we expect that with this activity that's happening in the factories where it's impacting Super Duty, Navigator, Expedition, that that may come down a bit more as well.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nLike 40,000 units. So it's a very large reduction in Q1, and we're planning another reduction in Q2 again. So we'll be right where we want. Our dealer day supply for our sales will be right in that mid-50 range, which is exactly where we want to be as a company.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. As a follow-up, Jim, you frequently talked about the critical nature of EVs. You actually gave a very long blog post on this over the summer. But I think we also know that your strategy is in part driven by compliance. So we've heard President Trump talk about pulling back the, so to speak, EV mandate. How should we think about your EV plans and resource allocation in this environment? And to what extent would you maybe revisit timing of Skunkworks or the next-gen Lightning, which I believe are planned for H2 2027, given the changing environment?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nWell, we're really confident of our EV strategy because, believe it or not, most of the things that are happening are kind of playing to our strengths. We believe that if the EPA or the California waiver is pulled, if there's some change to the CO2 regime in the US starting from 2027, by the way, the next two years, nothing happens. So it'll be 2027 and beyond. We believe that that will still be some kind of modest CO2 improvement required. But more importantly, EVs are 8% of the US industry. They're growing. The satisfaction with the vehicles is higher than combustion. And people who buy these vehicles don't go back to combustion for large parts. So this is a very vibrant market. It's also a global capability for Ford. Given what's happening around the globe, this is not just happening in the US. It's happening everywhere.\nThis capability of making money in high-volume EVs, getting new customers, is going to be a global capability. So that's why it's strategically important for us. Actually, in this kind of environment, the Skunkworks platform becomes more important. It's more affordable for customers. Let's say that CTC goes away. In that environment, without a leasing advantage, for example, more affordable on the actual cost of the vehicle becomes more important, not less. So I would say our bet a couple of years ago to build that platform, I think, winds up being, well, we'll see, but winds up being a good move. We have made some decisions on the three-row and others, and we will continue to make adjustments. We are not shy about our lower capital ambition as a team.\nAnd we're going to make sure that the EVs we produce are not me-too products, that they play to our strengths. And we know commercial EV customers are out there. We know that they like these vehicles. So those are our two big bets. We can make changes to our lineup. We don't see that at this point in time, but, as we said, we're not shy about making those adjustments if we need to, Dan. Does that make sense?\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYes. Thank you. That's really helpful color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Daniel Roeska with AllianceBernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, AllianceBernstein\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Sherry, welcome. Welcome again. Jim, let me start kind of with a quite strategic question. It seems like the business is facing a level of uncertainty not seen before and maybe I hope that's fair, both from the strategic challenges you mentioned, but also kind of from the policy and the rapid change in domestic policy. As you guide Ford kind of through this choppy water, what are some of the convictions or guiding principles kind of that still hold true in this environment and what are some of the principles or convictions where you and the board had to go back and kind of say, well, we'll have to take a look at that, or, that's become a little bit more uncertain?\nKind of just trying to understand how your thinking is making decisions in this environment. What can you rely on, and where do you need to kind of exercise extra caution?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you. Well, first of all, the cost journey that Ford is on is non-negotiable. It is absolutely mission-critical and controlled by the company. No one else controls that. It's us. We want everyone to understand how serious and how prepared we are to take our cost of business without and improving quality at the same time, which often can become at odds with each other. That is a guiding principle for Ford Motor Company, I hope forever. Within that, it's very clear that customers, regulators, and leaders around the world are expecting our industry to bring down prices and make affordability more a priority for car companies. One of the second big principles is we are going to invest in affordable vehicles, but we have to do it profitably, which means a transformation at Ford.\nYou can see the transformation we've had to take on the EV platform with Skunkworks. We will have to take the same type of approach on body-on-frame and unibody multi-energy platforms. That's why I mentioned it. That's the second thing. We want to make sure that we have diverse powertrains. That's another really important principle for us because we've learned, actually, when it wasn't popular to invest in hybrids, that it turns out to be a good move and therefore, we want to lean into EREVs and other new powertrains to make sure that we go with the flow, so to speak, of the customers. I think the last one is I have never, in my 40 years, had a chance to have recurring revenue where the company is not as susceptible to economic cycles and gas prices. And we can do that with Ford Pro.\nI think Ford Pro is leading this industry in showing large-scale services, both software, almost a million subscriptions now, and it's getting sticky so we can start to see the flywheel turn on Pro and we're just getting serious about repair of the vehicles. Those two attachments to our traditional vehicle is, frankly, what I've been waiting for 40 years to do as a leader for the company and for the industry. And how ironic it is that it's happening not in the retail world. It's happening in the Pro B2B space. Those are the principles that we hold dear at the company.\nProbably the most important for me is the best talent and the best culture because none of that is going to happen unless you get the best people in the company, which we continue to upgrade our industrial team, and our technology team, and to have a sustainable culture where quality and cost never go out of fashion. Now, we have a lot to execute to do all those things, but those are our kind of four or five key principles.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, AllianceBernstein\n\nThanks. Then maybe more tactical for Sherry on the guide for Model e in 2025. Volumes in Europe are higher. PTC is coming in at H2. Lithium prices are coming down. You're doubling down on cost efforts. Yet the guide is flat. Could you kind of help us close that bridge? Kind of where do you see the weakness in Model e this year to kind of offset those gains and improvements you're making?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. We're making improvements so that the Gen-1 products are still not profitable. What's really interesting about this, though, is that we're able to hold flat while you're increasing the volume significantly. The other thing that's going in there is the $1 billion of additional costs that are related to our BOSK battery factory as well as related to our Gen-2 products. So that $1 billion is about half engineering and about half in the BOSK area as well. And that's about $0.5 billion more than in the past. So one of the questions that you asked about was just what's kind of going counter to that. So that would be some of the downward pressure that you continue to see that's on the pricing potentially in Europe, potentially in North America.\nWhat's been great, though, is Model e, as it landed Q4 last year, the Mach-E, we had a fantastic selling, over 30% increase quarter-over-quarter, and we stayed above the average transaction prices. While we're seeing the pressure, we have been continuing to do well even with our Gen-1 products in our sales case.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, AllianceBernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, everybody. So, hey, Jim, we've heard that you really, really like the Xiaomi SU7, which, as you know, is their first car. I'm just thinking, when a country like the United States puts a 100% import tariff on another country that isn't even selling vehicles here yet, that's kind of talent. Do you think that US tariff policies will be successful in keeping Chinese EVs out of the US market long-term? I'm just curious what you think. I mean, especially given your experience working at Asian automaker before, we've seen this movie in the '70s and '80s. Do you really think the Chinese come here or that we keep them out? Is that good?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Adam. Tom Freeman wrote a really interesting piece on this topic that I think is really pertinent for us. In the end, the level of subsidies that these companies have in China is very material, as well as these are digital vehicles with digital footprints and really deep into people's digital life. So we have to have the right policies around privacy, the right policies around national security because these are not the cars of old. They're data collection machines. On the kind of unfair part or the subsidy part, I think we will have to sort that out as a country because they're part of the competitive environment that when you list the kind of advantages the companies have, it's like a page long, right? So we have to resolve that.\nBut in the end of the day, Adam, what I learned after 40 years in this industry is the company has to stand on its own toe-to-toe with the cost of those companies and the product appeal of those companies. So I guess what I'm saying is we need to work with our government partners to make it a level playing field as much as possible. But in the end of the day, it's management's responsibility to beat the SU7 straight up in a street fight.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot you, Jim. Thanks. Just as a follow-up, autonomy hasn't come up really much in your prepared remarks. And I find that interesting given all the attention around AI. Gen AI has put the autonomous vehicle theme on a totally different shot clock. You were clearly very wise to pause and restructure the Argo initiative in hindsight. But I mean, Ford has, I think you guys in the US alone, you got 40 million vehicles on the road driving a billion miles a day, probably more than that, a billion miles a day, Jim. And the data from that swarm is just insane. So I hear you on service bays and Ford Pro, and that's all great. And we understand that on the physical services. But what's the strategy around AI and autonomy really?\nBecause I think many argue that if you're an industrial company, an auto company like Ford, you either have an AI strategy or you don't have a future. I don't know if you agree with that, but how confident are you in Ford's leadership position in autonomy? What changes that? Is Sherry going to have to pay for that in-house with an in-house effort, or is now the time to partner? Thanks, everybody.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYou got it. I think we're at that point where we have to decide. Look, Level 3 is around the corner. BlueCruise is now over 300 million miles. Customers are still paying for it. We did drop the price, by the way, so it is getting commoditized to some extent, but it is still a great opportunity. But the capability in the company is growing. All those Argo people that came with Ford, they are developing a really nice Level 2, Level 3 system that we think will be among the best in this execution. We may not be the first. We may not grab all the headlines, but look at BlueCruise. BlueCruise is continuing to win all the consumer awards for the best operating system on Level 2. Level 2+ is around the corner. Level 3, we think, is a huge unlock on highway miles.\nEyes off. I think we're in good shape with our internal capabilities. But look, we're not so pollyannish about our own capability that we're not going to look at other people's system or not believe that Level 4 personal autonomy is going to be interesting at some point. They're making a lot of progress over there in Level 4. And it is time for us, not just in the US, but globally, they're looking at and that's why we made some of the announcements we did today because we need a strong strategy team to decide, do we partner? Do we continue to ride our own team into this Level 4 personal autonomy? I think you're going to find, just like our move on Argo, we'll be thoughtful and practical. We won't get in love with the size of the market. We'll make a practical decision.\nI think we'll be well positioned. I'm very confident in Sammy and Doug, and their technical prowess. They know the FSD system. They know what's out there. They know the Waymo system as it gets democratized for Level 4, individual Level 4. So I think we'll make a good decision. But I think, Adam, we're a lot closer to that partnering decision at Ford.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Please unmute and ask your question.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you. My first question is around your plans for cost savings this year, so net $1 billion improvement. Can you give us a little bit more color around what the drivers are for that, the buckets, and how do we acquire confidence that this will be the year where we see visibly a net cost improvement at Ford? Because if I'm looking at your guidance, it seems like in the second half of this year, you're probably now guiding for earnings growth despite fairly large cyclical headwinds that are assumed. So that sets a high bar for cost execution. So how should we think about the visibility into delivering this execution?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. So why we've got confidence going into this year is the approach that we took to building the business plan was very granular. We went through all areas of our business, and we're targeting efficiencies across all areas of our business. But there's two in particular that we're extra focused on. In Jim's prepared remarks, he also talked about the fact that we're really zoning in on material costs and warranty and in fact, we're even getting outside third-party support to be able to look at benchmarks, what is best in class, and what are all the different ways that we can make that even stronger. It's because of those detailed plans that sit behind those items that we have more confidence.\nThe other thing I would say is that on the design costs, we are entering this year with about 90% of our pipeline filled. Let me just double-click on what I mean by that. As we think about the cost savings that we want to make from a product design perspective, we have already identified those, and we've characterized when and which quarter those are going to be introduced into new products. That gives us a lot of visibility as to when we would expect to see those cost savings be realized.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIs this why this is back-end loaded?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThat's why it's back-end loaded.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, AllianceBernstein\n\nExactly. Takes time to execute. But boy, do we have a strong offer.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. My second question is around pricing. So you're assuming 2% price moderation for the industry, Ford doing a little bit better. You both have, in terms of outlook, you're highlighting pricing moderation as a headwind. Now, when we look at pickup inventories, there's almost a 100-day supply on dealer lots across not just Ford, but GM and Ram as well. And there are signs of pricing pressure and mix erosion. How should we think about the risk of something that is more than just price moderation here?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThe risk of something more than price moderation?\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah.\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nI mean, I think that.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nJust a little bit of moderation, yeah. Something that a larger price war in pickups when you have so many trucks sitting on the lots across essentially all offerings.\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nWell, one of the things that we're thinking about is the fact that as we entered or as we left Q4, we only had 13% of model year 2025 in there. So when we move through Q1, we're expecting that our transactions are then going to be about 50% model year 2025. Your natural uptick that you get with the transaction pricing increasing some relative to the model year is one effect that we would see that's counteracting it. We also have the new product launches of Navigator, of Expedition, F-150. So those are some of the effects. I mean, where we see the pricing pressure, maybe in particular, if you were to double-click into Pro, we see some pricing pressure there specifically around the environment for fleets, including daily rental.\nThat's one of the areas where we're seeing more of the pricing pressure versus the rest of our portfolio.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nMore granularly, I noticed that one of our competitors is running a dealer cash program for the pickup trucks. That's a very significant change. We'll watch this very carefully. I mean, we know as a management team, the most important thing is going to be inventory discipline for us as we go into this period of time, as Sherry said. And I just want to reassure you that we will always protect our brands in those key segments and always protect our pricing capability. The cost journey we're on as a company will take years, and it'll be great, but we will lose everything if we do not keep our pricing discipline. And that really is tied to inventories. So I really like our plan going in for the first half to get our dealer supply inventories back down below 60 days.\nThat's a really big effort by the company, and it will give us some room. But as you said, we don't know how our competitors are going to act and that's why we thought it would be prudent for us to go into this year with a very realistic guide in the range we did.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nSenior Autos and Auto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please unmute and ask your question.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First, on Pro, the company's had a view that Pro profits will be resilient in part as you increase your mix of software and services. You just spoke a bit around some of the headwinds you're seeing, especially tied to the daily rental piece of Pro. But can you speak a bit more on the puts and takes to that business segment for 2025 and then maybe what's your confidence that you can perhaps sustain or even grow Pro EBIT beyond this year as you think about adding some of the Super Duty capacity in 2026 and further increasing software and services mix toward that 20% of Pro EBIT target?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nSure. Yeah. So as you said, I talked a little bit about some of the softening in pricing around the environment for fleets, including daily rentals. We'd say volume and mix right now, we think, are about neutral, maybe a little higher in North America, being more offset by some market weakness in Europe. The other thing that's coming into play there is you do have and you're starting to introduce more EVs into the Pro business. So that does tamper profitability slightly. I wouldn't say that it's a large percentage of the mix yet, but that is growing. And so our ability to continue to bring costs down commensurate with the introduction of the EVs coming in is one of the areas where we're really focused for this year. The cost, we think, is going to be largely neutral, maybe slightly better.\nWe're expecting material cost efficiencies and some lower product costs and potentially lower warranty costs as well due to some of the initiatives that I mentioned earlier.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nTo give you some context about the changing revenue mix for Pro, in Q4, we got actually up to about 13% of our Pro business profitability was from services. We want to grow that to 20%. As you implied in your question, the vehicle side is always going to be super important. The pricing within that is going to be a super important driver for our profitability. What gives us optimism about the Pro business on the vehicle side is the freshness of our product. We have a brand new F-Series, a brand new Super Duty, and a brand new one-ton Transit in Europe. We have the freshest lineup on our vehicles that we have ever had. The competitors may react to that, and we'll see how that plays out in the market. What we're also really focused on is getting that 13% higher.\nBecause those margins on the vehicle repair side are 35%. On the software side, they're up to like 50%, 60%. That's really our opportunity to de-risk the company's profile.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for that. My other question was on tariffs. You spoke a bit about this in your prepared remarks. I know it's a really challenging thing to try and forecast but to the extent there are 25% tariffs put into place, they could actually come into effect next month. I know you spoke about a few weeks of ability to absorb it. But if tariffs are sustained, maybe you just talk a little bit more around what kind of cost impact that may have to Ford to the extent you can size it and how much of that you could potentially offset via actions such as pricing. Thanks.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nI think Sherry and I both said it in the kind of week scenario; we're in good shape if it was a number of weeks. I think with changing our stock level of our components, both ourselves and our suppliers, and changing our manufacturing patterns in both Mexico, especially, and the US, we can make sure nothing crosses the border for a couple of weeks. We have good stock situation in our dealers right now. Longer term, 80%+ of our vehicles are made in the US, 100% of our transmissions, more than half of our engines. You look at our competitors, and they're like a country mile away from that. Our US plants are busy. We do not have upside. We have some plans for Tennessee and Kentucky, and some expansion plans for our new EVs but our teams in the US are flat out already.\nSo there's not. I mean, we would have to make some major strategy shifts in the US, build new plants, et cetera, if this persists. Obviously, it's a devastating impact. What doesn't make sense to me is why are we having this conversation while Hyundai-Kia is importing 600,000 units into the US with no incremental tariff? And why is Toyota able to import 500,000 vehicles in the US with no incremental tariffs? I mean, there are millions of vehicles coming into our country that are not being applied to these. If we're going to have a tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever, it's going to be years, it better be comprehensive for our industry. We can't just cherry-pick one place or the other because this is a bonanza for our import competitors.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with UBS. Please unmute and ask your question.\n\nJoseph Spak [Managing Director\n\nAutos, Auto Suppliers and Auto-tech Equity Research] (UBS)\n\nThanks. Good evening. Sherry, just maybe to start on the free cash flow guidance, on a dollar basis, looks to be down, I'd say, roughly in line with the lower EBIT year over year. But given that you're talking about some destocking, I'd imagine there'd be some working capital and timing headwinds. So can you just help us understand some of the drivers that maybe get that higher and also maybe what type of distribution from Ford Credit positions in the guidance?\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So let me just talk about that a little bit. You will see that the free cash flow that we are guiding for this year is going to be right in line with the 50% to 60, which is our target. We have been running higher than that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. Part of that's due to timing differences. Most notably, that's related to warranty, and it's related to some of our marketing incentive items, which is causing timing differences. So as we go into next year, we do expect that the reduction you're seeing is going to be due to the reduction in EBIT, as you pointed out. There is going to be increasing in working capital. And we do expect some timing differences to continue into this next period as well. So that would be some of the major items.\nWe're not guiding on credits distribution at this time, but I think it's fair to say that we're expecting equal or greater than what we've had in the past.\n\nJoseph Spak [Managing Director\n\nAutos, Auto Suppliers and Auto-tech Equity Research] (UBS)\n\nThank you.\n\nSherry House\n\nIncoming CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nIn the past year, I think.\n\nJoseph Spak [Managing Director\n\nAutos, Auto Suppliers and Auto-tech Equity Research] (UBS)",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks for that. Jim, I want to go back to a little bit of the conversation you're having earlier on the multi-powertrain strategy, multi-energy strategy, sorry. You alluded to EREVs on the call, I think, in various other forms. You've talked about that. I guess I just was wondering if you could spend another minute or so talking about how you plan to really position and market that as a value proposition because there is a world where it may not be as necessary from a regulatory perspective if policy evolves. That would mean that it does rely more on consumer pull. So how do you really convince the buyer?What were maybe some lessons learned from the EV experience? Because I think there's probably a little bit of overexuberance about consumer reaction to that at the start.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYep. Thank you. When you have a chance to spend time with Li Auto, some of the best EREV companies out there and their customers, what's interesting for me when we started to absorb this leadership team is we were really impressed that the customers thought of these vehicles as EVs. They do not think of them as hybrids or plug-ins. These are electric vehicles. They use 95% of the miles as electric, and they plug them in every night. And the satisfaction is even higher because they're more affordable for people. The batteries are so much smaller with 150mi range versus these huge batteries and three-row crossovers for 300 and 350mi range. You're talking about tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars. For the customer, you're able to buy an electric vehicle that's fully comparable to an ICE vehicle in terms of cost.\nAnd because there's no transmission, there are no gears, no driveline, there's no duplicate axles, there's no duplicate powertrain, the incremental investment of fitting that combustion engine in there is very minimal to the customer. So I think at the consumer level, Americans love their big cars. They love their big trucks. That's what we do. We drive these big vehicles. But some people would love to feel that instant acceleration. They'd love to be able to drive by a gas station all the time. They love the feeling of electric, but they just can't get it. It's $30,000 to 40,000 dollars too expensive for these big vehicles. So this technology gives them the electric experience without the range anxiety. Now, it's not perfect. If you tow, it's not a good technology. The batteries have to be too big. So it's not a panacea.\nBut I think how we look at it is, given we're number three in hybrids, the Pro Power Onboard thing really surprised us. People love hybrids for more than just fuel economy. And I think we see this in more degrees of hybrid and PHEVs as a solution for customers, EREV for certain kinds of vehicles, heavy vehicles that don't tow, and a pure EV for commercial or very affordable. I don't know if that makes sense to you, but that's what I hear from the customers, why they love these vehicles.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director of Investor Relations, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's Q2 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO, and John Lawler, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, and you can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those statements stated.\nThe most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow. Are on an adjusted basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Lynn, and thanks for joining us. First, I wanted to thank our Global Team. Remaking Ford into a high margin, high growth, more capital efficient, and a more durable business is really hard work. It requires focus, collaboration, and excellence. I also want to thank our investors. We're committed to creating value consistently over the long term, and we appreciate your support and input. Execution against our Ford+ plan allows us to break free from the low margin, capital intensive, and cyclical attributes that have constrained legacy auto valuations for a long time, and this process does not happen in a straight line.\nWe are absolutely a different company than we were three years ago, and our pace of change is intensifying. The creation of Ford Pro, Blue, and Model e have been a huge catalyst for transparency, accountability, and more rigorous capital allocation. Our Ford Pro business is amazing. It's a high-margin business tracking towards $70 billion in revenue this year with further opportunities for profitable growth outside of vehicle sales, parts and service, and software. A good example of that is a recent decision by our team to add 100,000 units of capacity of Super Duty in Canada.\nIt not only serves our customers, but it's capital efficient and has very high returns for many years to come. As you know, we flipped our international operations many years ago from deep losses to profits now and positive cash flow with more opportunities ahead, and that includes China. We also took our product portfolio from too many generic vehicles and infused it with passion and purpose. We build out our iconic F-Series and Transit lines as well as passion vehicles like Mustang and the new Bronco lineup and sub-brands like Raptor, Tremor, and Dark Horse. Few OEMs can offer customer choice like Ford at our scale.\nFord is number one in our home market for internal combustion. We're number two in EVs and have been for 2.5 years, and we are the number three hybrid brand in the US, but what's less visible but incredibly important for investors is the foundational work underway in the company to move to software-defined vehicles and breakthrough digital experiences. I'll talk about that later. This will have significant operating leverage. Ford+ is on track. Today we reaffirmed our Adjusted EBIT guidance for the whole year and raised our outlook for adjusted free cash flow.\nI'm going to comment on our EV landscape and strategy. Software, technology, and services that are of growing importance at Ford are Ford Pro business and quality. On electrification, we've been very vocal about why electric vehicles are so important and a great choice for customers and businesses. Customers' usage data and cost of ownership data would indicate about 50% of customers who buy automobiles would be better served on buying an electric vehicle. Now there's lots of misconceptions around EVs in the separate areas of costs like resale value, insurance, of course, range, charging, and battery life.\nOEMs like Ford must do a much better job in educating our customers about the advantages that an EV offers in terms of cost of ownership. As you know, we are the number two EV brand in the US for over 2.5 years. That's a long time, and we've learned a lot, and now we have used those learnings to sharpen our strategy. What we learned is that it's incredibly important to be transparent about Model e losses inside the company as well. This forced accountability, and the result is our team is getting much more scrappy and resourceful in terms of turning the business around.\nWe are now more disciplined and have to be for capital and expense. This means we will not launch vehicles at a loss that are not good for our business, knowing what we know now about the reality of the market equation. We clearly see China and Tesla as the cost benchmark. We also see excess capacity that will lead to more pricing pressures, which is in our business plan, more consolidation, and many, many more partnerships. We see less vertical integration in some areas to relieve capital. We see a lot of tough choices on footprint. Early maturity customers are really different than the early adopters, particularly in retail. We see a lot more openness to hybrids and extended range electric vehicles we call EREVs.\nWe also see a divergence on electrification adoption between commercial and retail. Commercial customers focus on total cost of ownership. They use their vehicles much more intensely, and they do not overbuy batteries that retail customers do. They're also investing in our Pro charging depots and our integrated software because they want to be smart about the cost of charging their vehicles. I'm happy to say that our EV Pro contribution margin for our EV vans is now already positive. We also have learned a lot about the size of the vehicle. We believe smaller, more affordable vehicles are the way to go for EV in volume. Why? Because the math is completely different than ICE.\nIn ICE, the business we've been in for 120 years, the bigger the vehicle, the higher the margin. But it's exactly the opposite for EVs. The larger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the more pressure on margin because customers will not pay a premium for those larger batteries. And lastly, compliance. There is a lot of pressure on compliance. The lower demand for EVs, especially the pricing, means that CO2 credits are now likely going to be needed for fleet flexibility and optionality, and will be a critical strategy choice for any company. What are the success criteria for EVs in the future? Well, the first one is to have the right mix of fully and partially electric solutions. This is imperative.\nYou have to have a compelling product roadmap, and you have to have very flexible manufacturing. A good example is our hybrid business. The global hybrid portfolio at Ford is on track to grow 40% this year across nine nameplates. We really bet on hybrid trucks. In the first half of the year, our hybrid pickups, Maverick and F-150, grew more than three times the rate of the overall hybrid segment. Our F-150 hybrid with Pro Power Onboard is a game changer for our customers. Commercial customers have power on the run like job sites, and our retail customers have emergency power backup, and boy, have we seen that in Texas and all the other extreme weather events.\nHow important that is for our customers. The second success factor is matching the cost of the Chinese OEMs and Tesla, especially on affordable EVs. Now when people hear about affordability and they think about small and unaffordable, I'd like to address that now. We are designing a super efficient platform, leveraging innovation across our product development, supply chain, and manufacturing teams. With no engine or drivetrain, a smaller vehicle can have a much roomier package. Actually, the interior package of a class above with a small silhouette. That's a big advantage for customers versus ICE.\nWe're focusing on very differentiated vehicles priced under $40,000 or even $30,000. We're going to focus on two segments, work and adventure. Why does this matter? Well, the use case for smaller vehicles, affordable vehicles, means shorter trips, more urban locations. It fits the duty cycle of an EV and affordability. Well, smaller batteries have an outsized impact on the cost and margin of the vehicle. The consumer tax credit in the US become a much larger part of the sticker price of the vehicle. That is supercharging the lower cost of ownership that EVs have already without it.\nFinally we have the ability to leverage this platform across many top hats, which will drive scale and large install base for our growing software business. The last success criteria is to be really careful about your larger EVs. For us they'll be part of the picture. But success requires even more breakthrough on a cost efficiency, much smarter choices on segments, in our case work and commercial, a lot of partnerships, and a lot of technology pathways. Overall, the EV journey has been humbling. But it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our ICE business. And that will pay off in the long run.\nI am so happy we scaled 2.5 years ago and we have the option to incorporate those learnings into our next generation of EVs launching in the coming years. I want to double click on the software, technology and services business. Ford alongside Rivian and Tesla are really the only non-Chinese OEMs controlling software across all the vehicle domain. Most companies are doing OTAs on vehicle entertainment, but Ford now has multi-year experience on updating powertrains, braking, the fundamental performance of the vehicle, and connectivity. In the breadth of our portfolio, including F-150 and our Pro business, the customer use case is clearly much more complicated than Rivian and Tesla.\nOur vehicles are increasingly general-purpose computers capable of delivering the type of application environment, AI, for our customers and user experiences that we expect from all of our digital devices. And this allows us to create powerful, connected, ever-improving customized experiences which I'll talk about. Many of you may be surprised that Ford leads on OTAs. According to the 2024 OEM OTA capability rankings in North America, we are the leader based on quality of our updates. This is not how many updates we do, although we do a lot.\nIt's about the ability to improve the fundamental performance and capability of the entire vehicle and all the modules in the vehicle. There's no better evidence than Mach-E. Longer range, better efficiency on the battery, faster 0 to 60 times, better BlueCruise performance. We've done it all with Mach-E for many years now. Our vision is not just a powerful computer on wheels; it's actually a robot. We will link with these digital experiences. Things that only a vehicle can really do, like safety, security, and the other innovative use cases we shared with you at Capital Markets Day.\nThese experiences that will drive higher profitability and creative revenue and are the reasons for customers to actually stay with Ford and Lincoln. Lower marketing costs are now becoming clear to us. One example on the retail side on the technology is our first implementation of the Phoenix system. We call it the Lincoln Digital Experience with our new Panorama display and our new Nautilus. This experience is really a differentiator in the luxury space. With Google Maps, Google Assistant, and enhanced car play. Our sales have surged for Nautilus 48%. We now have much younger customers, and the biggest application for this technology is BlueCruise and ADAS.\nIt's a leading hands-free driving technology in America, we believe. We now have 415,000 enabled vehicles on the road. That's a 25% increase in one quarter. We have 213 million miles, 3 million plus miles of hands-free driving now since launch. To better dimension our progress of software technology and services, in the quarter alone, total company paid subscriptions grew 40% to over 765,000 paid subscriptions. Our integrated service revenue is now on track for double-digit growth this year. We are targeting $1 billion of revenue next year for our software. This revenue has gross margins of 50+% which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency.\nNow the major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro. So let me touch on that. The foundation of Pro is really simple. It's our vehicles. A robust and fresh lineup. The freshest we've ever had at Ford of ICE, hybrid, and EVs including the all-new Super Duty, the all-new Ranger globally, the all-new F-150 that has just finished its launch, the all-new Transit custom in Europe and our two small vans in Europe, the new Transit Connect and Courier, and the new extended-range 2-ton electric Transit we sell in both Europe and North America. Now what these brands and vehicles are seeing is resilient revenue streams based on a much longer tail spending on the infrastructure by government and private enterprise.\nWe also have a very robust and diverse customer range. We dominated small business and medium business with tradesmen, but we have very large customers. We have state, local, and national governments. And we have rental, which by the way is very profitable for Pro. In fact, in the US, one out of four of these fleets, mom-and-pop tradesmen all the way to large companies, one out of four of those fleets in the US are Ford-only. But the big opportunity for Pro is beyond vehicles, and that's where we're focusing. With Pro Power Intelligence, we have a highly-differentiated telematics offering. We offer real-time driver coaching, which provides significant improvements for driver safety and now is available in about half of our modem-enabled Pro vehicles.\nThis includes features like seat belt, speed monitoring, and harsh braking notification. Pro Intelligence is also a platform for vehicle controls. Our first foray, it's a big deal, is Fleet Start Inhibit, which protects our Pro vehicles from theft and also unauthorized use. We will expand these vehicle controls to speed control and acceleration limits in the near-term. Now no third-party telematics solution can offer this functionality because it's related to the vehicle. We call it uncrossable mode for our software business.\nOver 4 billion miles have now been traveled in the first half of this year on vehicles equipped with Pro Telematics insights and controls. Our paid subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew 35% year-over-year, now including 610,000 paid subscriptions, with triple-digit growth in telematics, fleet management, and charging depot software. Turning to physical service, which is the second big non-vehicle revenue profit for us at Pro, we have a massive opportunity to grow physical services of parts. In the first half of this year, Ford Pro was only 24% of our after-sales revenue. It's a huge upside.\nBank of America estimated the profit pool from maintenance, repair, and parts physical repair of the vehicle that escapes our dealer network is about $135 billion. That's 2.5x the profit dealers capture through vehicle sales and financing. This is a huge untapped TAM. Ford Pro already has the largest physical and mobile service network in North America but for specialized commercial service, many of which is open 24/7 for our customers with specialty technicians. And we continue to expand that physical network to a competitive advantage by adding Pro Elite centers, and mobile service units.\nWe are on track this year to reach 27,000 commercial service bays by the end of this year. That is up 20% year-over-year. Growth will be led by Elite bays, the largest and most capable of the service bays for Pro, which will more than quadruple this year to 1,300. We are now on track to increase our mobile service units by 45% to 2,500 service trucks and vans. That's 10% of our entire physical network. Mobile service network is incredibly important competitively. None of our competitors offer this kind of scale.\nWe address many repairs, limiting our downtime for our customers. We service multi-make fleets, which helps us with our shared garage unlike our competitors. And global mobile repair orders that generated from this fleet is up 115% in the quarter. Our focus on software and physical service expands the moat for Pro while helping our customers improve productivity and grow their business. Pro is on track for software and physical services to contribute 20% of our EBIT by 2026. On quality, we're making progress with our latest vehicles. Ford jumped 14 points in the latest J.D. Power's 2024 US Initial Quality Survey. We went from 23rd in the industry to ninth.\nBronco Sport is now named the best small utility and initial quality, outperforming 18 competitors. Our launch and initial quality are leading indicators for warranty in the future, and we expect to see benefits in the future. We did see warranty costs increase in Q2, of course tied to new technologies, FSAs, and inflationary pressures for the cost of repair. We expect technology related warranty costs to now normalize as technology matures and we deploy that great OTA capability to address known issues. We are confident we are on the right trajectory with a very clear and non-negotiable mission at Ford to deliver best-in-class quality.\nI'll close with this. The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains but is unlocking opportunity to serve our customers and grow in ways we never thought possible. My confidence comes from the fact that we have built a world-class team and we are executing a compelling strategy. No other company has Ford Pro. We intend to fully press that advantage. No company has a more compelling product lineup with an attractive mix of ICE and partially and fully electric options for both work and retail customers. We also know we have a lot to prove. We look forward to proving our EV strategy out that has become more realistic and sharpened by the tough environment.\nThankfully we scaled years ago. We are confident we can reduce the losses and sustain a profitable business in the future with everything we've known. We look forward to proving that we can be profitable on smaller vehicles as well, not just on EVs but across all of our powertrain choices. It's time to prove our recent quality gains are repeatable and will flow to the bottom line. Plenty of work ahead, but the direction is crystal clear to us. We are building a high-growth, high-margin, more capital-efficient, and more durable Ford. John.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim, and I want to thank the entire Ford team for their hard work and continued focus on executing our Ford+ strategy. More importantly, we are working aggressively to remake Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin, and more durable business as you said, and frankly, a higher-performing company. Our automotive business is solid and consistently generating strong free cash flow, which is a core ingredient to drive total shareholder returns over time. Now, in the quarter, we generated nearly $48 billion in revenue with growth of 6%. Wholesales were up 2% as our fresh and compelling product line gave our retail and commercial customers unmatched freedom of choice.\nThe quarter benefited from record Transit wholesales as well as the completion of our all-new F-150 launch, including drawdown of the inventory we had held at the end of the first quarter. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 5.8% as higher costs were partially offset by the continued strength in Pro. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in warranty reserves, higher new product related material costs, and higher manufacturing costs.\nNow if you take a step back and look at our sequential performance, Q2 saw revenue growth of 12% on a 9% increase in wholesale driven by higher truck volume and the strength of our product portfolio. Despite this revenue growth, EBIT was flat, reflecting primarily higher warranty and manufacturing costs related to the inventory, which was driven by seasonality and the high volume launches. We remain on track to deliver $2 billion of material, manufacturing, and freight efficiencies over the full year, which will partially offset higher labor and product refresh costs.\nWe are seeing emerging headwinds in warranty and inflationary pressures in Turkey, and we are working to mitigate these costs. Now, I have more confidence in today's business than ever. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated and driving continued top-line growth, and we're slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. We're on track to deliver our full year guidance, and we are generating stronger and more consistent cash flow than just a few years ago, evidence that our Ford+ plan is working.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion through the first half, resulting in a cash conversion rate of 51%. Our $1 billion increase to adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year underscores our growing confidence in the business. Our balance sheet remains strong with close to $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, providing considerable flexibility in a very dynamic environment. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our Q3 regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on 3 September to shareholders of record on 7 August.\nNow let me spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of our customer-focused segments and highlight how each of them is driving Ford+ and making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 9% increase in revenue on a 3% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we resegmented our businesses. EBIT was a solid $2.6 billion with a healthy margin of over 15% reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit volume that are both capacity-constrained along with higher net pricing.\nFord Pro is the prototype for sticky high-margin non-cyclical revenue. Pro's results this quarter continue to demonstrate consistency, predictability, and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business. Ford Model e generated the loss of $1.1 billion as continued industry pricing pressures and wholesale declines of 23% more than offset lower cost. Our team's intense focus on cost delivered about $400 million in savings to the bottom line in the quarter. Key factors included reductions in material costs, improved battery economics, and lower engineering. This builds on the cost reductions we have achieved since the launch of our first generation products, helping to improve our profit outlook as we head into 2025.\nFord Blue revenue grew by 7% on a 3% increase in wholesales led by growth in trucks and strong pricing. Wholesales were impacted by the launch of the Explorer as we ended the quarter with about 21,000 vehicles in inventory for quality checks. EBIT of $1.2 billion and a margin of 4.4% were both down year-over-year, mostly driven by higher warranty. Once again Blue was profitable in every region. Our hybrid sales up 34% in the quarter continue to shine, and our global hybrid mix is now approaching 9% up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way.\nFord Credit generated EBT of $3,343 million down slightly year-over-year. As expected, auction values declined by 9% and lease return rates continued to normalize from historic lows. Credit losses and insurance losses were also higher, but mostly offset by an improvement in financing margin. We continue to originate a high-quality book with US retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low as EVs represent less than 5% of our lease portfolio. So now let me turn to our outlook. As I referenced earlier, we continue to expect full-year company Adjusted EBIT in the range of $10 to 12 billion.\nIn general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance, and industry dynamics, including market equations for our four segments, are playing out similar to what we forecast at the beginning of the year. We are increasing our Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance by $1 billion to 7.5 to 8.5 billion, supported by strong earnings and lower than planned CapEx. We are keeping our CapEx target range of $8 to 9 billion and are focused on delivering at the low end.\nOur outlook for the year assumes a flat to slightly higher SAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumption for the US is 16 to 16.5 million units full year of customer demand for all new Super Duty, contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro, lower industry pricing of roughly 2% driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the second half of this year. For Ford, we expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products, warranty reserve increases from software, higher repair costs, and FSAs. Our segment outlook anticipates continued Ford Pro strength, and we are increasing our EBIT range to $9 to 10 billion reflecting further growth and favorable mix partially offset by moderated pricing.\nAs expected, losses in the range of $5 to 5.5 billion for Model e driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles. For Ford Blue, we are trimming our EBIT range to $6 to 6.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher warranty. We expect Blue's profit trajectory to significantly improve in the second half, reflecting higher volume with the F-150, Explorer, and Ranger launches that we've just recently completed and our recent capacity expansion on Bronco, and we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, double-digit growth year-over-year.\nNow our performance this quarter demonstrates the positive progress on our Ford+ plan. We're disciplined with capital, and we have the right portfolio of products, and we are delivering consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly seeking out new ways to make our business better and remain focused on driving improvements in both quality and cost. That wraps up prepared remarks. We use the balance of the time for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, everybody. Jim, you said that Ford's a different company from what it was three years ago, but stock market really doesn't seem to agree with you at all on that. Stock's down about 10% after-hours, around $12 a share. My team just ran the numbers. Ford ranks 494 out of 500 companies in the S&P on PE. Jim, my first question is, do you think Ford's stock is good value?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYes.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThen why does your board refuse to authorize a share buyback? People on this call, I think they understand the reason, like the family element. But in your opinion, if you're telling me this stock's a good value and it's like the bottom first percentile of the S&P. What's the plausible reason? Why? Do you really think you have better uses of capital than that?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYes, we do. And I have to tell you that it's hard for people to understand those possible uses of capital. But we have so many exciting businesses to invest in, and Pro is a great example. I'm not going to get into specifics, Adam, but I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are at Ford. I'm not just referring to vehicles, I'm referring to non-vehicle activities. We have 27,000 service bays. There's lots of opportunities. And as I said, when you look at Ford Pro, just deep dive on that one. And I'm so glad you asked this question, by the way.\nSo, Ford Pro is a very, very high percentage of our company's profit. Just look at the ratio between the overall company's EBIT and Pro and our guidance. And then think about our after sales business. Only 24% of our revenue comes from Pro related vehicles. And we could spend a lot of time talking about this opportunity. But that's why I highlighted in my comments there are so many places for us to grow Pro on the physical services. They're like 35% margin. But it's hard stuff, right? It's like bays and technicians, and a lot of work.\nWe have very exciting electrical architecture investments that we have to make in our future that will really change our ICE vehicles and their revenue potential. Because that revenue won't be just when we sell the vehicle, it will be over time, which we're seeing with Pro already. So I don't want to belabor the point. I'll just tell you there are plenty of opportunities. Anything else?\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, just a follow-up on Skunkworks. Your team's made a number of visits to China the last couple years, including, I think, just a couple months back. I believe you were there. What are you learning from these trips? And specifically, I mean, you mentioned China along with Tesla, the cost benchmark. But do you think Ford can bring to market a low-cost EV profitably without help from your partners in China or is China part of the solution? And if China is part of the solution, then what are you going to do about it?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYes, great question, and an important question for any OEM as the EV market evolves here. Look, we made the bet on CATL many years ago. It was a very important bet for our company to localize LFP cells in North America happen to be in Michigan. We're two years into that project. That is a signature partnership. CATL is the largest battery-maker in the world, and they lead iron phosphate, cost and reliability. That is a signature partnership that we launched many years ago that we've been working hard on, and Marshall's on track.\nLook what Volkswagen is doing with XPENG and many others who are kind of taking a Chinese low-cost platform and using that. That's not our strategy. Our partnership strategy will be on the component side, going deep into the supply chain for IP that is critical and unique. I'm not going to get into specifics, but CATL is one example and we're going to learn how to do that at the company. We believe that this is essential know-how for the company because the true fitness test for EV profitability will be on these small vehicles. We have learned from our experience with Mazda, Kia, and many others that we have to have this know-how in the company because it applies across all of our vehicles, not just EVs. The lowest cost is the most important capability.\nWe believe that many of our competitors will turn to their Chinese, either independent companies or partners, to basically use their platform globally. We learned a lot, not just from China, but from MEB. We've been scaling MEB. We know the cost of Volkswagen. They're one of the leaders in scale. And what we found in that trip and subsequent trips to China is that we have a very competitive battery with CATL. But many of the Chinese players in the lower cost have very affordable batteries, but they don't have the most efficient design outside of the battery, on the other EV components.\nAnd our team, the Skunkworks team, we might as well call it a big team now because it's no longer Skunkworks. We're betting on them as our affordable platform. They have really designed breakthrough EV components with our own design that we think are better and cheaper. We have a very competitive battery localized with the IRA benefit. The partnership discussion we think will largely play out in larger vehicles. We think that's where the big partnership opportunity really lies. In the commercial vehicles that I talked about, we have nothing to say right now, but this is.\nWhy is a partnership so important? Because the bigger vehicles have this kind of inverted cost, and the partners allow you to be more capital efficient and have better returns. That's why we think that the partnerships on larger vehicles will play out as vibrantly as affordable vehicles.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBruno Dossena\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could just contextualize what fundamentally within the organization you think is leading to these persistent warranty issues. And I realize partly it's because it was on a prior industrial system, but just given how frequently the surprise warranty issues keep popping up, how do you have visibility or how can investors really build confidence in an earnings trajectory when, you know, every year the surprise warranty issues keep happening? Thanks.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you. I think the most important evidence, the J.D. Power's IQS, that's a really big point of evidence for everyone. Our internal data, by the way, had been saying that for quite some time. It's now verified. I think that is clearly cutting the initial quality defects to a fully competitive rate, where we're leading some segments will clearly bring our warranty down over time. But as you said, it takes time. You got to launch vehicles. You've got to get in the industrial system and make sustainable changes.\nThe other one, I would say, is as painful as it is quarter-after-quarter to have all these great launches, we do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing. And it makes our quarters lumpy, and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time. When you look at the root causes for these issues, and I can go through the hundreds that we go through, it's very clear that these are issues, many of which we could have caught at launch. And that is what's happening now at Ford. We have to go through all these launches to find these, and over time, we're confident they come down.\nThe other thing we maybe made it more difficult in a way, but better for the company fitness-wise, is we put a lot of new technology in our vehicles. And that new technology is difficult for the dealers to diagnose when customers come in and say something's wrong with my SYNC system. They replace modules unnecessarily, et cetera, and that hits our warranty reserves. What we have found, though, is that this kind of fixing is different than mechanical fixes where that OTA capability redirected to these defects can really reduce our cost outlays against the warranty reserves. We're working all of those cost curves every day for each of our models. John, anything to add?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah, I think that, you know, there's the lag that you're going to have between the quality improving and the warranty run rates improving. And so, you know, the first step, as Jim said, is the quality improving. And we're seeing that in the physicals now. And that lags, you know, 12 to 18 months. And we should start to see the warranty coming in. On the prior models, you know, majority of what's coming through our FSAs, we're doing things to fix those quicker, get out in front of them, reduce, you know, the impact of them. But we're working that every day.\nAnd, you know it's an issue that, you know, the team is focused on and the encouragement is that the quality is improving. And that is the most important thing for the future of the business and the longer run rate of the business.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nWhat we won't do at Ford is reduce our actual cash expense at the expense of our customers. We will fix these problems. We will do the right thing. I don't care if it costs rental cars or whatever. We want to turn these quality issues into positives for our customer experience.\n\nBruno Dossena\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you. So to step back, and I think this touches on Adam's Skunkworks questions, but when you compare Ford now to history, earnings are now significantly higher, but the capital base has expanded such that returns really haven't improved. And this isn't just Ford. This is most Western automakers. The earnings part of the equation is only partly in your control, but the structural costs are.\nSo how are you thinking about the trajectory of structural costs from here? Even simply, are they going up or down? And B, given this is a similar dynamic for a lot of automakers and so many traditional automakers are investing billions in R&D, really trying to achieve the same thing with respect to EVs, make an affordable EV at scale to compete with Tesla and Chinese OEMs. Why do you think the legacy OEMs are all doing this by themselves? And why aren't there more partnerships? Thanks.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nWell, I would say that you have to think about how you're going to fundamentally change the development process. I think that's the core thing. It's not necessarily just doing it with somebody else. Sure, we're looking to be as capital-efficient as possible, bring partnerships in for capital, but you can do that on components and you can do that in other ways as well. And we know, and we've done a lot of work understanding what has kept this industry kind of in that penalty box that Adam was talking about as you mentioned. We're not capital-efficient, we're lower margin, we don't grow enough, and we're not resilient.\nIt's a very cyclical business. And we're working to change that. We've walked through the areas that we're doing and attacking to improve those key areas, but it's really about the efficiency of the design. And the Skunkworks team is doing something very different. That team is unique for a traditional OEM, the talent on that team. They're doing an agile waterfall systems integrated design process which no other global OEM has done, traditional OEM. And we're really working that to be focused on what can happen from a tech standpoint as well.\nThat vertical integration really helps us drive to those lowest costs. We're finding that there's ways to be more efficient in many ways than some of the Chinese by incorporating the technology that the team's able to bring forward, and leveraging the know-how that they've had from the last products that they've put forward. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us with that team, the talent, and the change in the process that's not only going to show up when we get to our affordable EVs that are going to come from them. But it's also important to understand that if you don't have that transfer function Jim talked about, the entire company isn't going to improve. And by doing it within the company with that team, we have a much higher probability of that transfer function being successful.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYes, and I would just emphasize that the ambition at Ford for partnering on EVs is record level high. We're not going to make any announcements in earnings call, but this is absolutely a flip the script moment for our company. We have done partnerships like Volkswagen. We have learned how successful, how to be successful with the 1-ton Transit that includes an electric vehicle. We really see that opportunity in front of us. But we are not going to partner to the level where we delegate our future and the future fitness for cost competitiveness outside the company. And if we have a partner, we have to have that transfer function that John mentioned.\nI would only say that we need as an industry to start focusing equally on the one-time cost investment in the electrical architectures and the transition to digital products. Now, the integrated services that we're finding, we have 765,000 paid subscriptions. They are different than our competitors who just basically do it for infotainment. We are basically productivity on Pro as well as BlueCruise. To take that to the next level, make that business supercharged, we need to invest heavily in electrical architectures, not just on our EVs but also in our ICE vehicles and hybrid vehicles. That will be a one-time investment.\nThe benefit of that was what I was trying to highlight in my script, which is, you know, when the economy turns down, we still have those subscriptions. Our service business customers turn to that even more in a downturn because they keep their vehicles longer, they have to do more maintenance. These are ways to kind of de-risk our exposure to economic cycles. We have to make OTA, the updated IBI system, the integrated services team, both B2C and B2B, our electrical architectures, these are all basic enablers that go beyond EVs, and the industry is going through that transformation too. And I believe Ford is in advance of others because we have more complicated platforms than Rivian, and Tesla and many of the other all OEMs.\nBecause of that, we also have more scale. We have more complexity, but we have more scale. And I think that transition and kind of structural change in the industry is as big as the EV change. We're going to get to $1 billion of revenue we think next year on software. I wouldn't have thought of that three years ago.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood evening everybody. Just take it back to more sort of the core of the business. Jim, I just wanted to go through some numbers or kind of your take on the Ontario Super Duty capacity add. Obviously it's a big step up in capacity for the Super Duty 100,000 units. It seems like current demand would certainly soak that up or absorb that reasonably easily. But I'm just curious if you think we might be hitting a peak in this truck. What's your view on the ability to sustain these high levels of demand and sell through? How should we think about incremental margins on that?\nBecause it seems like a $3 billion investment might have a payback of less than two years and then spitting out a lot of cash, real quickly. So it might be a really, really good investment. So I just wonder if you could talk about that and what kind of powertrains those trucks will have?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYep. Thank you. So powertrain-wise, it will be a diverse powertrain multi-energy platform. I'm not going to get into specifics, but you can imagine what we've done with F-150 and Transit van. We've gone to, and all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform. So we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have. We believe we'll be a first mover, if not the first mover, in multi-energy Super Duty.\nLook, we saw the $1.2 trillion investment in infrastructure, the JOBS Act, that is coming home. There's a 5G upgrade that's going now. I think it's close to $300 billion investment. I'm really glad you asked this question, John, because it's not obvious to people. The real part of our Super Duty business that has been under constant supply strains is our chassis business. It's about 25% of our entire Super Duty business. But they are not pickup trucks that people use like what you think in road construction.\nThese are people with bucket trucks doing 5G upgrades, heavy construction. And that is, that is the demand that we have not been able to fill. Ford is, and I'll give you an example, we dominate ambulance in the US. Ambulances tend to use our Super Duty chassis business. The average age of an ambulance in the US is 15 years now. They are all falling apart. We have not been able to service that industry, and now we can with this incremental capacity. So it's an aged fleet, the chassis business. It's got a ton of investment tails to it still. We lead in the industry because of our upfitter in the product.\nNow we're going to take the lead on the multi-energy part. That's kind of the story, and it will be a great payback. And we wouldn't be doing it at Ford unless we thought this demand would last for many, many years to come, John.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, and if I could sneak just one more in, maybe for Cathy, on the used residuals or the residuals at auction, it seems like although down year-over-year, the last three quarters they've stabilized and started to improve. I'm just curious what your outlook is there. And it just seems like the supply is going to remain relatively constrained in the used market or late model used market. So this might be a good guy, not just for Ford Motor Credit, but for resid and potentially, you know, a lift or support for new vehicle pricing. So just what are your expectations there and what are you seeing in the market, Cathy?\n\nCathy O'Callaghan\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Credit Company\n\nYes, so we're seeing auction values down about 9% this quarter year-over-year, but up sequentially about 3%. We're expecting auction values to continue to decline in the second half of this year, and we're also expecting our return rates to increase as well in line with that.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to start first with a question on Pro where we're seeing these continued strong results, and really pricing is doing a lot of this strength. So I understand all the bits about pent-up demand, and that's really helping. There's really a thirst for these products. But maybe you can help give us some color on the sustainability of this pricing and specifically A, how long is this tail of pent-up demand? B, how much of the pricing is contractual versus let's call it more spot retail, which would be more subject to the market fluctuations? So, any color on the trajectory of pricing in Pro given it's had such a strong run.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So when you look at Pro, you know, we've been talking about the fact that the demand supply imbalance has been, you know, great for the top-line and it's been running pretty strong. Right? No surprise there. We have been forecasting that we expect as we move into the 2025 model year that there will be some of the top-line coming off and that's in our guidance. So we understand that over time that's going to get chipped away at a little bit here and there. But we also believe that there are very underserved segments like chassis that we're going to be able to provide product to where there'll be more price stability as we move forward. So we don't see prices collapsing.\nNow when you look at our business, about I would say 60% of it or so comes from the fleets, which are negotiated on an annual basis. Those have remained very strong the last couple of years. I've talked about in the past that we'll start to see what the 2025 model year contracts look like as we move through Q3. Initial indications are continued demand beyond what we can supply. But we'll work through that, and we'll have an update as we come through Q3. But you know, we're seeing demand continue both on the typical fleet contracts as well as through the dealers when it comes to, you know, the smaller fleet customers, the fleet tail we call it, where they're buying two or three vehicles at a time. So we're watching this very closely.\nBut so far, with 2025, early indicators are positive, but we need to, you know, really move through that process much deeper before we can say where 2025 is going to fall out.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company",
    "content2": "I wish there were car wars for commercial because if there was, we would see the product freshness at Ford be an outstanding situation for us. So aside from kind of the industry backdrop of the industry pricing and the demand, I think one of the most important decisions we made several years ago is to go full in on Pro. So we invested in a 1-ton Transit, which is our profit machine in Europe, we invested in a new Ranger. Globally we invested in a brand-new Super Duty, including chassis, including Multi Energy; we invest in new F-150, and we have all these new electric Transit, 2-ton Transits. That was very intentional.\nWe did it several years ago, and now that will pay off, I believe, as we look into these multi-year contracts. For Ford at least, it's very important to understand how outsized the freshness of our lineup is at Pro. I've been here 16 years, I've never seen all of our core products updated within a 12-month period like this.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you, that's helpful. As a follow up, Jim, I'm wondering if you could just address the electrification strategy in light of the November presidential elections. We know obviously there's one candidate who's talked about pulling back on the EV mandate and there could be some implications on IRA, or the Federal or California mandates. I appreciate you've talked about the need to have flexibility. I think you've been referenced earlier on the call that credits will play a role. But maybe you could give us a sense of where the strategy is. Is your strategy one that's more existential, that clearly with Skunkworks it seems to indicate that it is, versus a strategy that is maybe one that's just more meant to reach compliance with a longer term goal in mind? But maybe you can give a sense of how the strategy might change, if at all, depending on the outcome of the election.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. Thank you. Obviously, Ford's had a lot of history, a lot of experience, and wisdom after 120 years of elections. I would say think about our strategy this way. We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions. So we believe as a company, even if there were short-term adjustments we can make to a compliance-led lower-requirement lineup, we're not going to approach it that way. We really believe what I said, which is that many Americans would find an electric vehicle lowering their cost. Not everyone, but a high percent.\nWe believe that to be fully fit globally, whether it's our Ranger business, our commercial business, or anything really, we have to find a way inside the company to be fully fit with lots of partnerships on the supply chain side. So this is a kind of enduring strategy at the company. It is not a strategy where we handicap the presidential election for the next one and the next one and see what we can get away with the EPA. That is not how we run Ford because Ford has, Ford didn't go bankrupt. We have been enduring. And the only way we believe to be enduring is to make money on small EVs and commercial. And that's our bet. You'll see it play out in coming years.\nIt's a big adjustment from our Gen 1 products. I'm glad, as I said, we scaled 2.5 years ago because we could learn about the reality of the market equation, which is just requiring us to be more fit and move faster. The EPA could certainly change, but it would take, as John said, several years through legislation and lawsuits for that to change. So even from a compliance standpoint, you know, we can't really count on administrations changing this way or that way. I've been to the Hill many times in the last month talking to many Republican leaders of the country, and I always say the same thing to them. Please realize that there's a subset of customers that absolutely will save money.\nThere are also absolutely a group of customers who like partial electrification. Ford's strategy is choice, manufacturing flexibility, and choice. We are not going to bet the student body left on this or right. We are going to give customers choice. We are going to be flexible in manufacturing. That's why we want to be a first adopter to an EREV or whatever's next on partial electrification because we want to be first and best at the choice. But on EVs we need to be fully competitive with BYD, Geely, even our own partner Changan. And the only way for us to have done that is through this small group in California.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe final question today is from Ryan Brinkman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, Ryan Brinkman from J.P. Morgan. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on the warranty performance that led to the higher cost. I remember a similar issue with higher warranty expense back in 2022, which you then tied to, I think, a transmission installed on vehicles some years prior, while noting that the quality on vehicles built more recently had improved. So, you know, I know you're prioritizing initial launch quality, including with the F-150 we discussed at length last quarter. But really any color you could share would be helpful, such as, you know, whether the higher warranty provision this quarter relates to a discrete issue like in 2022. Or maybe you could share what age cohort of vehicles is driving the higher cost this quarter.\nWith that new provision, do you think you've got a better handle now on what future costs could be and the provision in future quarters? You know, it could normalize lower as soon as next quarter. Or how would you rate the potential for quality performance in older vehicles to maybe surprise negatively again?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah, Ryan, I mean, that's part of the issue, is these are issues that are popping up in the field on these older models. The largest one coming through is on a rear axle bolt for vehicles that were engineered for the 2021 model year, which was when they were introduced. If these things come through at a higher time in service, we're made aware of them. We need to take care of our customers. We go out to fix them. And we have several of those types of things popping up on older models. We got a failed oil pump issue that's popping up on 2016 launched vehicles. And so it's clear that we had a period of time where the robustness wasn't what it needed to be and that's showing up.\nIt is hard to predict on some of these units that have been out in the field for quite a while that one of these issues is going to show up, these longer-term durability and quality issues. But we need to work through that. And we do believe that overall, as we improve our near-term quality and that as it starts to show up in the field, that will allow us to, based on the rules that we have around how we do our accruals, bring down that overall accrual level. So these types of issues, if they pop up, will have less of an impact overall because our run rate on quality will be improving.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, thanks. Maybe just to follow up on how your comments there might relate to what Jim was saying earlier about Ford controlling the software stack from bumper-to-bumper from, you know, all the over-the-air update capabilities. What did these new capabilities mean for your ability to troubleshoot or prevent, you know, warranty issues in the future?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nVice Chair and CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThose are critical because when you look at some of these things, you know, that have been out in the field for a while that have failed, you know, they cross over. Let's say they were launched in a 2016 model year, which was the first year it was done. So it was designed and engineered in 2013, 2014, 2015, launched in 2016, and it's been out there for quite a few years. With the connected vehicle and having the digital electrical architecture and us controlling the software across all of the operating domains, we will be able to get signals off the vehicle early to tell us whether or not we're having an issue in certain components.\nIf we understand that early, we can understand the cause of that, and then we can go out and minimize, reduce, get out there earlier, and reduce the number of vehicles that are impacted and actually either do an over-the-air update if we can fix it that way, or do a preventative maintenance type program for folks, which will be much cheaper than a field service action recall where you're replacing components and modules, et cetera. So there's a lot of advantages through that connected data that we'll be able to run through warranty, the warranty system that's more on the physical side. On the software side, we'll be able to understand.\nWhen things are an issue much earlier, and we'll be able to fix them through over-the-air updates, which will be a much lower cost as we move forward.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nDuring our launches. Kumar and Doug have partnered in a way that hasn't been done at Ford for a while at least, where we are testing vehicles to failure and individual components to failure, which is not our launch standard, but we are now doing that and. We are also looking at the DTC codes off the vehicle, especially powertrain DTCs, running these vehicles at extremely high mileage, far beyond our standard for launch. That has caught many, many issues in our industrial system that we've been able to correct before we release the vehicle. It's painful to have all these vehicles over quarter ends, but it's the right thing to do for the company, and it is the only way we believe in addressing our warranty spend.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Ford Motor Co. second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Jim?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The cornerstone of Ford Plus is pretty straightforward: a more resilient business model, higher growth, higher margin, and more capital efficiency. I would say Q1 had a lot of great green shoots in that plan. It sets us up for a very strong 2024 and beyond. Before John goes through the quarter, I wanted to highlight four key strategic areas: how our growth drivers are changing, our progress and quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in Q1.\nOn growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix, and having good news on pricing.\nWhat's changed in the last year, and especially in Q1, you could see is our top-line and bottom-line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix, and we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. That new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the number one best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world.\nOur Ford Transit cargo van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. Our midsize Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is a third best-selling vehicle at Ford. Together with the Everest, it makes up our profits outside of China, North America, and Europe. It's an incredible new franchise for Ford.\nThese changes in our portfolio at all different sizes and price points in the truck and the van business have really played to Ford's strength. It doesn't stop there. Our growth drivers are diversifying. We now have a vibrant software business and physical services business led by Ford Pro. You don't need to look very far beyond our mobile services, an example. Ford now has 3,500 or more remote service vehicles in our fleet globally.\nLast year, we did 2.4 million remote service experiences, both remote service and pickup and delivery. 40% of that was for Pro, and 60% was for our retail business. Ford now has more than 700,000 paid subscribers for software. That's up 47% year-over-year. It's capital-efficient, and the gross margins are more than 50%. Our quality is making real progress. Kumar and the team have really focused on key areas.\nOur 2023 model year, three months in service, initial quality is 10% better than the previous model year. We're seeing our current model year that we're selling for several months, another 10% improvement. That should put us in the middle of the pack, and many of our vehicles start to lead their segments in initial quality. To bend the curve on warranty costs and customer recalls, we're really focusing on our launches. We're past the Super Duty launch now and well into the F-150 launch, and we made a lot of changes to improve and bend that curve. On the F-150 and others, we've delayed the okay-to-buy three to six weeks. We've taken a lot of new testing regimens.\nActually, we ended the quarter with 60,000 units in our plant stock, which hurt our Q1, but will benefit because we're shipping those now in our Q2 for all those quality processes. And what we're so far seeing is we avoided about 12 recalls on F-150, and we're seeing the best performance on three MIS after a launch in a long time. And I'd like to be specific here.\nNormally, after a launch, we've seen about a, in the last five years, about a 70% spike in our defects. The industry average is about 20%. And the Super Duty and Mustang launches were about that industry average 20% spike. And now we're seeing with the F-150 even better performance than industry average. And boy, do we have a lot of launches in the second half to prove out this new launch process.\nWhat we're going to see long-term is fewer recalls and lower warranty costs because of this new process. I'm really proud of the team's progress on quality, and we have so much more to do. I'd like to talk quickly about Ford Pro. When we look at Q1, we made $3 billion. That's how much we made the whole year in Pro two years ago. We're growing revenues, EBIT, and EBIT margin. We're growing our volume. Our attach rates for high-margin software and physical services are improving.\nAnd when you ask yourself, \"Why is this different? And why would this business, why would these profits be more resilient than our retail business?\" it comes down to three things. First is the diversity of a customer base. About 1/3 of our Pro customers are small business. Another 1/3 are large companies, and about 20% more is governments, all different kinds.\nAnd the diversity of those customers, and all three of them are driving a white-hot demand for our vehicles and services right now from infrastructure build-out, roadworks, 5G, onshoring manufacturing, and re-fleeting for our key government fleets. One out of four of those fleets are all Ford, and boy, do they trust our company. But more than anything, it's the breadth and freshness of our new lineup at Pro that's driving our profitability.\nWe have the freshest lineup we've had in 20 years in Pro. We have an all-new Super Duty, an all-new Transit from top to bottom, and we have an all-new Ranger in five-plus plants around the world. These new products are really attractive to customers. And beyond that, we have the most diverse Class one through seven lineup in North America, our key market.\nThat adjacency sales are important because customers buy different kinds of vehicles for us in the same fleet. Beyond that, in those fresh nameplates, we offer the best choice. We have cabin chassis and cutaway versions of our vans, different wheelbases and heights, the same on our pickup trucks. We also have the most choice in terms of upfitters. We have 500 different upfitters across Western Europe and the US that prefer to work with Ford because of our experience with them.\nIt doesn't stop there. We design all of our commercial vehicles with a multi-energy platform, and that allows our customers to choose electric, partial electric, diesel, petrol, whatever choice on powertrain that best meets their cost of ownership. No one has this kind of lineup in our business globally.\nThe third key area is the diversification and the completeness of our software and physical services experiences for our customers. Now, 13% of Ford Pro's profits in the last 12 years make up these attached services. It's a big change for us. What's really driving that is our advantage in physical service. We have the largest repair network you can find of any brand out there, and we're widening that gap.\nWe've added 700 commercial service bays in the last year, and more than 11 very large service lead centers with between 50 and 200 repair bays that are open 24/7 for our customers. None of our competitors offer this kind of extensive repair network. It doesn't stop there. We have over 2,000 remote trucks and vans doing remote service for our Pro customers. No brand can match that either.\nAnd now we have over 560,000 active software subscriptions for our Pro customers. That's up 40%. And that Pro Intelligence business took many years to build. It requires advanced electrical architecture, and it's a really hard moat to copy. Long and short, Ford Pro is in for a great performance over the next several years.\nWhat have we learned on electric so far? Well, as you know, we're number two in our whole market in electric sales for the last couple of years, and boy, have we learned a lot. Since capital markets last year, we continue to adapt and evolve our spending and our investment ramp for battery plants and assembly capacity for our EVs to match customers' demands. And more importantly than all of that, match the price expectations. We're retiming our launches and our capital spending.\nIn fact, this year, we expected to spend about $10 billion as a company. We've now guided $8 to 9 billion. We'll probably be on the low end of that range. We're being very consistent about our discipline on profitability. We expect every one of our EVs to make money in the first 12 months. That is a very disciplined process.\nIn fact, we delayed the launch of our three-row crossover, which is a great product, two years, not only to match the slower growth in EV, but more importantly, to take advantage of new battery chemistry and formats to substantially reduce the cost of the batteries for that vehicle. We'll do everything it takes to be profitable in the first 12 months of our vehicles. What's our bet as a company? Well, it's pretty simple.\nWe're going to bet on commercial work vehicles where we do really well, where we know the customers, where we can innovate for them, like Pro Power Onboard with partial and fully electric vehicles. But increasingly, our bet will be on our new small, affordable platform developed by our team on the West Coast.\nWhy is affordability so important? When we look at the connected car data from our EV customers, we notice that people live in the suburbs, urban customers. They tend to drive shorter distances, and those more affordable vehicles are more approachable. And we believe that's where the adoption of EV will go the fastest. And we believe we can compete in segments of small cars and vehicles, more affordable vehicles in a unique way that's Ford.\nA good example was we learned a lot when, in our more expensive vehicles, Mach-E, when in February we dropped the price 17%, our volume went up 141%. That's telling us that the more affordable we can make great product, the more attractive it is to these mainstream EV adopters. The last thing I'd say is we're learning about the importance of choice. Our growth in Q1 in hybrids is a good example. We grew 36%. We think the full year will be 40%. We're now approaching 400,000 units of volume for our hybrid business, and we're now number three in hybrids in the US. It's a big advantage. We've been in the business for more than 20 years.\nWhat's really exciting for us is for the first time, some of our contribution margins on hybrids are above or at similar contribution margins than our pure internal combustion engine margins. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nOkay. Thanks, Jim. Our team around the globe is becoming more focused and adapted, applying the Ford Plus strategy, and we really did deliver a solid quarter. We are transforming Ford into a higher growth, higher margin, more capital-efficient, and more resilient business. We're progressively shedding behaviors that have weighed down performance and valuation of legacy auto companies for most of the industry's history. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated, offering customers freedom of powertrain choice and drove Q1 revenue of $43 billion, up 3%. Our revenue has grown in each of the last three years, and we expect 2024 to be no different.\nWholesales were down 1%, more than explained by the late-quarter launch timing of the new F-150. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.5%, reflecting continued strength in Ford Pro. Costs were up $1.2 billion, but if you double-click on this, you'll see that $1.1 billion of that was investments in growth by Ford Pro, including new products.\nFord Blue and Ford Model E costs were roughly flat and were on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $500 million, more than explained by the vehicles in inventory, and this impact will reverse in the Q2. Our balance sheet remained strong with $25 billion in cash and close to $43 billion in liquidity.\nEarlier this week, we also completed the renewal of our $18 billion corporate credit facilities, extending maturities by an additional year. Overall, our strong liquidity provides significant flexibility for us to invest in profitable growth. Consistent with our commitment to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders, today, we also declared a regular Q2 dividend of $0.15 per share, payable 3 June 2024 to shareholders of record on 8 May 2024. I'll spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of each of our customer-focused segments.\nThere's evidence in every one of them of how Ford Plus is making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 36% increase in revenue on a 21% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we resegmented our business.\nEBIT more than doubled to $3 billion with a margin of 16.7%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit production, richer Super Duty mix, and higher net pricing. In addition, over the past 12 months, roughly 13% of Ford Pro's EBIT came from software and physical services, on the glide path to reaching 20% in a few years. This important revenue stream generates sticky and recurring gross margins in the 40% to 50% range. As you can see, given the breadth and depth of Ford Pro's competitive moats, investments in growth drive tremendous operating leverage.\nThe segment's results this quarter demonstrate the consistency, predictability, and earnings power of this growth business. Ford Model E generated a loss of $1.3 billion as significant industry pricing pressure more than offset flat costs as wholesales declined 20%. In the quarter, we took action to bring down inventory levels.\nFor example, after being at a price premium to competition in 2023, we lowered pricing on Mustang Mach-E in the US by 17%, bringing us in line with the two-row crossover segment. As Jim mentioned, we did see elasticity with an improved mix of higher trends. In the US, retail sales jumped 77% versus the total EV segment, which was up roughly 2.6%. Our total EV market share grew by 3.4 points to 7.5%, and Mach-E was the second best-selling SUV, only behind Tesla's Model Y.\nThe bottom line is that we're more competitive and doing well in the marketplace. We've reduced our stock levels significantly, and the pace of sales has increased. In Ford Blue, revenue, wholesales, and EBIT were down, all impacted by the F-150 production ramp and vehicles in inventory. EBIT margin was 4.2%, and our international operations continued to be profitable across the board.\nFord Blue's global product portfolio remained strong, and our hybrid sales continued to grow, up 36% in the quarter as we get the benefit of hybrid products planned years ago. Our global mix of hybrids is currently at 7%, up 2 points year-over-year, with more products on the way. Additionally, China exports increased 33%, including Lincoln Model S, and that's consistent with our strategy to better leverage that asset-light footprint.\nFord Credit generated EBT of $326 million in the quarter. Financing margin improved, and credit loss performance continued to normalize and remains below our historical average. Importantly, we continue to see a high-quality book based on strong FICO scores, which continue to exceed 750. As expected, auction values have declined by roughly 10% as lease return rates continue to normalize.\nSo we're beginning to unlock the huge potential for customers and all of our stakeholders with the freedom of choice made possible by Ford Plus. There's plenty of work ahead to fulfill that potential. However, the progress we've made so far is undeniable. We're delivering growth and profitability, sharpening capital efficiency, and fortifying the resilience of our business.\nAccordingly, turning to our outlook, we continue to expect full-year company adjusted EBIT of $10 to 12 billion, and our tracking toward the high end of this range, and that would be a record for Ford. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $6.5 to 7.5 billion, supported by the underlying strength of the business and lower than planned CapEx. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is consistent with our cash flow conversion target of 50% to 60%.\nWe're tightening our CapEx range to $8 to 9 billion as the team adjusts to the dynamic EV landscape. We're scrutinizing every dollar and driving efficiencies that we believe could land us at the lower end of this revised CapEx range. Our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAR in both the US and Europe.\nOur planning assumption is for the US is 16 to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Industry supply demand normalizing. From a planning perspective, we're assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2% driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products.\nThere's no change to our segment outlook, which anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro, leading to EBIT of $8 to 9 billion, and that's driven by the continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, loss in the range of $5 to 5 billion for Model E, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles. For Ford Blue, EBIT of $7 to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and also cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs. We expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, up slightly year-over-year.\nOur performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the positive momentum of Ford Plus. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products, and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. So thank you, and operator, please open up the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, everybody. I got one question for John and one for Jim. John, you were just on Bloomberg saying EVs are needed to meet compliance regulations. Now, it's my understanding that Ford does not disclose penalties or ZEV credit purchases for Ford on cleaner regulation. Can you confirm that? That's not disclosed, right?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nSo let me clarify a few things, Adam, on that. It's not an option for us not to be compliant. If you don't comply with your ZEV or your greenhouse gas emissions requirements, you can't pay fines. What happens is you can't sell, and that's consistent across the industry. So that's for all OEMs. All OEMs are under those rules. And so there's really three levers that we have. We can sell EVs and hybrids. We can sell fewer ICE, or we can contract to buy credits from another OEM. And when we do contract to buy credits, we will disclose that as we did in our 10-K at the end of the year. And so those are the three levers.\nWe, I would say, monthly, if not weekly, are working to optimize across those three levers to drive the highest profitability and the highest cash flow for the company. So to continue to sell the ICE vehicles, we are going to need to sell EVs, and we're going to optimize across the profitability. Now, the most important thing, as Jim said, is we need to get the EV business to stand on its own to be profitable and return on the capital we've invested, and then all the levers will be accretive to Ford, and we'll be able to make it really positive. So that's what we're focused on, and that's what I intended to communicate earlier today.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. So you do disclose. You disclose the ZEV. What was it?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. We disclosed last year in the 10-K that we had purchased commitments of $700 million.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWill that increase this year?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nIn Q1, there wasn't anything material. As we go through the year, if it's the right lever to pull, as I said, as we're optimizing, we will report it.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAll right. I appreciate that, John. Just my follow-up for Jim. Ford Pro is kicking butt, okay? At a 10x EBIT, that business could be worth double Ford's entire market cap. The market's kind of implying that the rest of the business would be valued at negative many, many tens of billions. Seen another way, your stock, I mean, this business is incredible. People would die to have this business. I think folks are aware. It's not a secret anymore, Jim, that people are aware of how good this business is, yet your stock ranks 491 out of 500 companies in the S&P 500 on PE multiple.\nNow, Jim, I know you don't like it, and I know you don't agree with it, but can you explain why does the market value your company as one of the lowest multiple companies in the world in any industry? Try to rationalize that for me because it seems important that you, as the leader of this organization, understand that so you can address that problem. Thanks.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Adam. First of all, thanks for your report on Pro. I appreciate you taking the time to understand the business. Look, I mean, as John mentioned, we have to make tremendous progress on Model E. It's a huge drag, not just on Ford, but on our whole industry, even for pure-play EV players. We're very clear-eyed about that. We're very committed to transparency. A lot of OEMs will handle EVs very different. We won't.\nIt's like if we had an unprofitable regional business and we rolled it up and it wouldn't be transparent to investors, we would never do that. And we're not going to do that with EVs. And we're not going to subsidize our Pro and Blue business by not being transparent about E. And it's how we run the business. I think investors should understand, for me as a leader, is that we're going to build a sustainably profitable EV business with terminal value. And it needs to return the cost of capital on its own and not be subsidized, as I mentioned. And the real turning point for us not only is our flat cost in Model E this year, but most importantly, it'll be the profitability in our next cycle of products.\nI'm proud of the work that our team has done to make the adjustments in our capital spending and to make sure that all of our next EVs are profitable. The evidence will be there. I think that is the main drag on the company right now, as it will be for our whole industry. Blue is in really good shape. I wonder out loud, Adam, if everyone really understands the resilience of the Pro business over time.\nWe're very profitable now, but we believe that this business will be profitable and durable for many years to come. I'm not sure the full market understands that personally. I know you've gone through the business, understanding the demand, and I encourage everyone to understand and ask us more questions about Pro. Thanks.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nSVP, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGood afternoon, guys. The freedom of choice is a great marketing tool to go out to market with, and I think it's reasonably or should be very effective. But, Jim, as you think about this, as the market is shifting towards hybrids, at least in the near term, I'm just curious what kind of capacity you have to ramp up significantly in hybrids if the demand really is there.\nAnd if you think about sort of the competitive threat really coming from Toyota with a lot of capacity on this side, is there risk that this market share losses to them over time, or do you have the ability to really step up here? I think you mentioned something about 400,000 hybrids on an LTM basis, but can you do a whole lot more and really sort of garner your fair share of the market?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nHi, John. We made a lot of capacity decisions several years ago on hybrid, and I'm very thankful we did. For example, we just radically increased the capacity for F-150 that we're launching now up to 25%. It takes, as you said, it takes a long time for suppliers to ramp to that capacity. It's not assembly capacity that's the constraint. So that 400,000 is almost double what we did a couple of years ago.\nThat was all very intentional. We made the decision a couple of years ago to actually make hybrid more pervasive in our lineup, and we're actually now going to—we've now committed publicly—we're going to offer hybrid on all of our vehicles across our lineup. Of course, the capacity has to be there.\nBut if you look at the pricing premium today, which is maybe the most important thing to look for, because now that contribution margin for hybrid is covering the cost of the hybrid incremental material cost, that's really meaningful development. And I think we're in good shape. Of course, our hybrid business is different than the others. We're number three in the US. Number one and number two is close to Toyota and Honda. But our hybrid capacity is in trucks.\nThat's where most of our hybrid sales are in North America. And we don't see a lot of competition so far for that business. We'll see over time. So I feel really good about the decisions we made several years ago about our capacity expansion. Will it be more than 40% growth? It could be. And I think we have flexibility. Now we have really meaningful scale for our suppliers. A lot of our competitors will be starting from scratch.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nSVP, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOne follow-up on Ford Pro. It seems like there's a lot of pent-up demand on the fleet side, both on commercial and government. I'm just wondering if you can comment on that on sort of a unit basis as well as potentially a service basis, and just really kind of talk about what kind of benefit that may sort of still garner towards Ford Pro, which is, as you said, shooting the lights out, or we should say that. It just seems like there's a lot of opportunity here still just from a market release of pent-up demand, and that might be even more structural over time.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nIt's true. The demand on Ford Pro is fundamentally different than retail. There's no doubt about it. Our retail customers are not re-fleeting. They're not doing roadworks and 5G infrastructure build-out. I mean, these are all fundamental drivers. The ambulance market in the US, the average ambulance is 15 years old. I mean, they've been waiting for Transits for a long time. We're now increasing capacity, which is great.\nBut I mean, we're oversubscribed on the new Super Duty two to one. So I wish I could say we got that right. We didn't, but we are expanding capacity, I think, and we have this freshest lineup that we've never had. So we have this kind of double opportunity. Our lineup is fresh. We have the most choice. And at the same time, our customers are in kind of white-hot demand that we saw in retail two years ago during the supply shock. And we're doing everything we can to increase our capacity for our customers. It's very frustrating for them.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nSVP, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I'd love to get some more of your thoughts on capital allocation, including, as in the release, you repeat the intention to return 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. I guess with CapEx coming further down and FCF up, there's more to return. But at the same time, targeting to return only up to half of what you generate obviously implies you want to continue to grow cash on hand despite the current $28 billion being well more than the over $20 billion that you've historically targeted. And of course, you've got lots of available liquidity beyond that, close to record, I think.\nSo just curious what might be driving the conservatism here, whether it relates to more macro or industry uncertainty or wanting to preserve some other optionality or for some contingency I'm not thinking of. I think in the past, when I've asked this question, you'd sort of point to the industry transition toward EVs, but it seems like the last couple of quarters now your focus is more on improving the EV business by trying to spend less, not needing to spend more, right?\nSo just wanted to check in how you're feeling about capital allocation, what you're seeing that causes you to want to be conservative now, and then what could cause you to potentially want to become more aggressive in the future.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So thank you. So we have our stated policy, as you said, 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash position: we ended the year strong. We're at $25 billion this quarter, when we talked about the fact that our guidance for this year went up.\nSo when we look at it, we believe that right now, in the transition point for the industry, we would rather invest in accretive growth opportunities. And we've always said that if those opportunities don't come to fruition, then we'll need to look at other allocation decisions that we would need to make. But we're not there yet. So we're continuing to talk about this as a team consistently.\nBut we think at this point, the position we're at, we're comfortable with, given where we're at in the transition. We'll pay out 40% to 50% of free cash flow. In the last couple of years, it's been at the high end of that range. And eventually, as we continue to execute on our Ford Plus plan, if those accretive opportunities to allocate capital for additional accretive growth aren't there, then we'll look at other ways of returning that cash to our shareholders.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nAutomotive Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBruno Dossena\n\nSVP and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask in Model E, and I understand that reaching break-even depends on the timing of the launch of the next-gen vehicles. But in the intermediate term, can you tell us how you're thinking about the trajectory of losses in E and specifically the potential to work down the structural costs associated with this business?\nYeah. So we are, I don't know, it's a cliché, I guess, laser-focused on all the costs around Model E. For the year, when you look at, well, let's just take back up a second. The last couple of years, when you look at Model E, we've actually reduced the cost of our vehicles significantly. On Mach E, we've taken over $5,000 of cost out, but the revenue keeps dropping faster than we're able to take out the cost. We're being very thoughtful about what we're putting in as far as structural costs, etc.\nSo we're going to continue to work on driving every dollar of cost out of the business in the near term. If the pricing stabilizes and we don't see these significant reductions continuing across the industry, then I think that you could probably start to see some of those cost reductions flow to the bottom line.\nBut so far, the last 12 to 18 months, it's just been a continuous march down on the top line, which is offsetting any of the savings we've had from a cost standpoint. So it's in our control. We have to take cost out. We know that that's what we're marching towards, and we're understanding the dynamics and the competitiveness of the market equation as we set up the cost structure for our second-gen vehicles. And as Jim said, we pushed out the three-row SUV because we need more cost to come out of that for that to be at the margin levels we expect.\nOkay. On a similar vein as the comment you made around costs and pricing for the Mach-E, if we look at your combustion, Blue and Pro, we see the costs are up $1.2 billion year-over-year, presumably from material content on some new launches, warranty, maybe offset by some savings. We also see that pricing in these businesses is up about $1 billion. But can you give us some insight into if or when you'll see some improvement in variable costs relative to pricing and Ford beginning to close the variable cost gap compared to peers? Thanks.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So you look at that, most of the cost this quarter was up in Ford Pro, and it was all related to the material costs for our new product launches, both the Super Duty and the Transit that we launched in Europe, as well as manufacturing costs for the increased volumes that we're bringing across, as Jim mentioned. So that's what drove most of the cost increase in the quarter. We're on track to deliver the $2 billion of cost reductions we talked about at the beginning of the year around manufacturing costs, material costs, as well as freight and overhead. And so you'll start to see that really gain traction as we move through the second half of the year. And that's when you'll start to see it on our quarterly results.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAutos Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just two questions for me. First, on back to Pro, with the $3 billion outcome in Q1, can you maybe talk about the points and takes when I think about the rest of the year, and maybe should we think about the full year at the high end of the range?\nAnd then going back to Model E, the press release did allude to EV costs improving going forward, but an offset from top-line pressures. Hoping you could help to mention what you're assuming for EV prices the rest of the year. And as volume kind of responds to these price cuts, is there a level where Model E can still become contribution margin positive over the next 12 plus months?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nSo let me unpack that. So for the year, we're not projecting or sharing where we expect the cost to come down. If you look at what recently happened in the quarter when it comes to pricing on Model E, we had entered the year assuming that prices would come down about 20%. They came down much more than that. We had to take our prices down another 17% to remain competitive and match competition as we went through the quarter.\nSo we've seen prices coming down quite dramatically, and that's why we haven't been able to keep up from a cost reduction standpoint. We're targeting to take out as much cost this year as we can on Model E and all in the spirit of driving towards that contribution margin positive so we can have some leverage as we move volumes through the chain. So that definitely is our intention as we continue to work on Model E in the near term.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nOn Pro, obviously, Q1, Pro is really structured not necessarily on traditional demand like retail. It's actually deliveries. So our delivery volume in Q1, it's a cyclical business globally, and we have a lot of strong delivery in the first quarter just because of the contractual agreements with our customers, including fleet tail. And when you look at the rest of the year, we have shutdowns. There are a lot of other, we have launches. There are a lot of reasons why we feel really comfortable even with a strong result in the first quarter, that our guidance is still accurate for Ford Pro, given all the puts and takes. But we'll revisit in Q2. We'll see how pricing lands.\nWe're going to be doing quite a bit of fleet tail business this quarter, as well as looking at locking in pricing for some of our large corporate fleets later in the year. So we're going to learn a lot more this quarter on whether there's tailwinds or headwinds on Pro.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nAutos Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nTerrific. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Joseph Spak with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director and Autos Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Jim, first to start, I appreciate all the commentary you talked about on the F-150 launches as well as the Super Duty and Mustang and some of the improvement there. As you mentioned, you've got some other big launches coming up later this year, I think the Explorer and a number of others. So was the lesson learned that you will go more cautious and careful, and should we expect a slower ramp-up than we've seen historically for some of these new launches later in the year?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nI would say we're seeing real benefits to our customers and the company, I believe, long-term in taking this new approach to launches. It also requires our industrial system under Kumar to work differently, to solve problems, to do different kinds of testing, and that goes into kind of our longer-term lessons learned. And we're now really spending a lot of time on long-term durability, which is an area where Ford has standards that maybe didn't look to lead the industry, which we now look to. And so we're not going to change our approach to these launches.\nWe think this new, more measured approach with more physical testing, a lot more time for problem-solving for our team is the right approach for the company in the midterm and long-term. We do have some very significant launches coming up. We have Explorer and Aviator, as you mentioned, which are high volume in both North America and in China.\nWe have a new wave we call wave two for the one-ton Transit in Europe, which is super profitable, and we're going to be building and launching the higher-end derivatives of that. We have the Bronco in China. I mean, I can go on and on. We have a refresh in Maverick and Bronco Sport coming and even more models than that. So given all that complexity, it's actually even more important for us to take our time.\nAnd in may, like Q1, it may mean that in some quarter ends, we may have some company stock and plants to make sure that we do the right thing on quality. So our earnings may be a little bit lumpy. We'll see how that works out based on this new approach.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director and Autos Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks for that. And then just back to the hybrid conversation, because as you pointed out, your hybrid portfolio is much different than a Toyota or a Honda. It's pretty limited. I think you only have three hybrids right now. But how should we think about scaling that to the rest of the portfolio, as you mentioned? Is it really taking existing power plants you have and trying to sort of make it fit on more models, or are there real new investments that need to be made for hybrids?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nIt's a good question. So, I would say mostly it's taking our current internal combustion engines and adding new hybrid components and doing the engineering to fit that. Look at the T6 platform. We have the Ranger. We have the Everest off it. We have the Bronco. That's an obvious candidate. We have our full-size SUVs candidate. We have the Explorer platform.\nAnd I think we're lucky. We have the right engines. Some of them may have to go to an Atkinson cycle engine from a normal combustion cycle. We have the components in our system from the hybrid, the torque splitting devices. We do have to up the investment in some capacities, like our hybrid transmissions, but we've made the decision to do that already, and that's in our spending plan this year.\nSo I think we're in really good shape. It doesn't require wholesale inventing new powertrains, but it does involve some engineering and investment in capacity. I would say kind of modest investments, mostly in the capacity side and some engineering.\n\nJoseph Spak\n\nManaging Director and Autos Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you for that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic about pickup demand, but I think there's media reports, and some of the data showing pricing was a bit weak in Q1. Inventories look pretty high. So are you seeing any risks in the market, and where do you see pricing for some of these models coming for the rest of the year, I guess, now that you got maybe some of the 2023s out? And then where should inventory really end?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So what you saw on pickups for us as we came out of the end of last year into Q1 of this year here in the US is we built up stock because we knew we were coming into the launch. So we built stocks for 2023 models. And then we were selling those down in Q1 throughout the majority of the quarter. And that's why you saw, to stay competitive with our competitors that had 2024 model year pickup trucks, we saw some top line come down. So we had higher incentives to sell the 2023 model year longer through the quarter. You see now that our 2024 F-150s are at dealers and selling. They're turning in about seven days.\nYou'll see as you look at the data that our average transaction prices are going up, and our incentive spend is coming down because of the 2024 model year mix. So that's a big part of what moved it for us on pickup trucks. And it was because we're such a big player; it was moving it.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nI just want to emphasize, I don't think there's a brand out there that has a Maverick that's pretty much alone in the segment, and we still are in a supply shock for Maverick. It's one of our fastest growing vehicles. We have an all-new F-150 with a hybrid option. As John said, turning really fast.\nWe have a Super Duty on the Pro side that's oversubscribed two to one, and we have a brand new Ranger.So we're a bit of a unicorn in the sense that, yes, we're big and there is some risk, but I would say the risk is for people who have aged product. And I think Ford is in a particularly advantaged situation.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd what about inventory levels? I think some of the data is showing it in the high 90s ending March. Is it going to come down to?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah, that's come down considerably. And if you look at us on an overall basis, our dealer-day supply is mid-50s.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nWe're completely out of stock on Rangers. Maverick is like 30-day supply or something like that. F-150 came down because we had quite a few 2023's, but now with the launch and the quality effort, I think the stocks are really in good shape. And Super Duty, we have very few in stock for retail.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So you got to look at the dealer-day supply, and that's in a good place.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd just as a follow-up, maybe a color on industry pricing. What is sort of embedded in your guidance at this point, and how is pricing holding up, I guess, sequentially? Because I think some of the comps are a little tough with launches year-over-year.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. First quarter, pricing held up pretty well Q4 into Q1. From a planning perspective, we assume that the industry we expect to see pricing pressure of about 2% negative pricing across the industry. And it really comes back to affordability. Many folks across the industry have been talking about pricing coming down, and it hasn't. And again, we saw in the first quarter that it remained pretty robust. But we keep looking at it from an affordability standpoint, from the consumer perspective.\nWhen you look at where consumers were pre-COVID, then we had the supply shocks, and we had a very imbalance between supply and demand. But now, as that's normalized, we would expect that affordability should go back to where it was pre-COVID, and that's about 13% to 14% of monthly disposable income. You also have to factor in right now with interest rates that payment prices have gone up, insurance rates have gone up, as well as maintenance rates.\nSo when you take all that together, we think about affordability. We say, \"Okay, if you're going to be back towards that range of affordability for the consumer, then prices are going to have to come off a couple of points or so across the industry.\" So that's how we think about it, and that's what we have planned. We'll see where that runs with Q2 and then as we go through the second half of this year.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. All right. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Narayan with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nThanks for taking the question. Jim, we heard from your guys' commentary that if EV prices drop, stabilize, then the losses would lessen. But as we've heard from some of the earnings yesterday, Tesla, GM, it seems like the opposite is happening. It seems like OEMs are trying to make cheaper EVs, and that pricing is really only going to go lower. I guess, how confident are you that you could reduce EV losses in this environment if EV prices just keep on going down?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company",
    "content2": "So when you look at it, it's clear that when the EV craze started, right, it looked like demand was going to be well long supply. But that was with the early adopters, and they were willing to pay a higher price. What we're finding with being in the marketplace is that EV prices are normalizing, and our early majority customers are not willing to pay a premium.\nThat's what we're seeing. So we think that prices for EVs are going to normalize around where gas is, and the consumers are going to weigh the value proposition of that propulsion choice, either for their duty cycle, what works for them, either it's going to be an EV, a traditional ICE engine, a diesel, or a hybrid. Pricing is going to have to be relatively consistent across all choices of propulsion, and the customer will make a choice based on the value of that. That's how we're building the business model for electric vehicles.\nI don't think that you're going to find that you're going to have electric vehicles well below gas prices unless there's so much capacity pushing against the demand curve, and it's an imbalance on that end of it. But eventually, rational players will have to come to the marketplace. We launched our first small SUV this year in Europe in Cologne, our Explorer. It's a two-row crossover. It's a relatively small vehicle, certainly in the US.\nAnd you can expect, as I mentioned several times, that our new affordable platform will be used for most of our volume in their next cycle of product. What's really exciting for us is that we see an opening in the market. We see a lot of brands having to launch compliance vehicles that lose money. They probably don't want to sell a lot of volume, but they have to.\nWe believe that we can be profitable at $25,000 to 30,000. There's a huge opportunity for Ford. What we're learning with BlueCruise and our productivity software on Pro is that all those vehicles will be great platforms for software and services. So we're really excited about that new, more affordable vehicle lineup, starting with the Explorer in Europe this year.\n\nTom Narayan\n\nLead Equity Analyst, RBC\n\nThanks. Maybe as a follow-up, maybe this is something that can help here, is battery raw material costs. We have lithium down 80% since it peaked in 2022. Could you just remind us of how your contracts work? I think we've heard from some other OEMs that there's still some benefits to come, actually getting better given how contracts work, and you could actually see some benefits on battery raw materials later in the year.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah, we're seeing the same thing. We're no different.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nI would say that the biggest leverage on the battery cost is still going to be taking nickel out of them and those kind of things. It's great to see the easing of some of the raw materials, and that will definitely cascade into our business depending on our contracts. I think the most important thing strategically is to get to new chemistries that have a lot less expensive materials in them. And we see that right around the corner at Ford. And we're changing our launch timing to take advantage of that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of US Autos Research, BNP Paribas Exane\n\nHi, everyone. Just back on Joe's question regarding this year's heavy slate of model launches. I know the hyperfocus is on improved launch quality. I believe, Jim, you mentioned at some point Ford Pro lost $1 billion in profit last year from a more deliberate Super Duty launch, excluding the impact from the strike. My question is, we already saw the F-150 refresh this quarter result in 60,000 units getting pushed. Is there a risk to Ford Blue's guide from lower launch volumes? Is this already factored into the range, or is it mainly expected Ford will avoid any material slowdown from here?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nIt's already factored in.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of US Autos Research, BNP Paribas Exane\n\nAlready factored in. Okay. That was easy. Can you just unpack how the implied ASP for Model e in the quarter finished in the $10,000 to 14,000 range? And then just given the slow volume start to the year, should we still be expecting modest full-year growth for Model E?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. We expect high single-digit growth in the Model e, primarily with the launch of the Explorer, as Jim mentioned, in Europe. When you look at the average selling price with the math, it's difficult because of the quarter. So we had quite a few units in stock, and as we saw the competitive pricing in the industry come down, we took our prices down too. So then we had to take the prices down of all units in stock equally. And that was about $300 million of impact there. So when you look at the tenth of revenue for the quarter for Model E, you need to add that 300 in if you want to do the math based on the wholesales in the quarter.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of US Autos Research, BNP Paribas Exane\n\nGot it. Maybe my first question doesn't count, given how easy the answer is. Just on the 2 billion in material manufacturing cost savings for this year, I know they're not going to be clean numbers that stand out in the bridge quarter to quarter, but can you just give a high-level assessment on the progress to date, what initiatives are really showing through, and any color you're willing to share on first half or second half timing on those initiatives? Thanks.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nYeah. So the majority of them are going to be towards the second half. I'm really encouraged by the progress that Kumar and the industrial platform are making around the design changes. And those design changes are timed to be implemented as we get the new model year changeover in the second half and as we bring vehicles online in the second half.\nSo that's one area where I've seen tremendous progress by the Ford team as they're working on those design reductions to come through. The other area we're seeing progress is in manufacturing. And Bryce and his team, as they're working to drive efficiencies to help offset the increases we have this year based on the contract that we signed last year. So in both areas, I'm seeing green shoots there. And Liz is doing a really nice job on the supply chain side as well. We've got better systems, tools, and processes. We're working more collaboratively with the supply base. She's changing the culture.\nAnd so across all three of those areas in the industrial platform, between what Kumar's doing, leading the team with Bryce and Liz, we're seeing green shoots, and we're confident on the $2 billion this year, but mostly timed towards the second half.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nOne of the most important priorities for us as a team is to take that cost down and improve quality at the same time. On the design side, for example, we have specific windows where the team can make design changes and not to protect our quality. I just want to emphasize that because we're trying to do both at the same time: improve quality and improve our cost in the industrial system. To do that, we have to be very intentional.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector and Head of US Autos Research, BNP Paribas Exane\n\nThanks.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThis concludes the Ford Motor Company Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO, and John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit, Kumar Galhotra, COO of Ford, and Marin Gjaja, COO of Ford Model e. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 25. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis.\nIncluded on our earnings deck this quarter is a table of our global wholesales for 2023, with nameplate detail by segment and major geography. This is a roll forward of the detail we shared with you last March at our teach-in in our new segmentation. Lastly, I want to call out a few near-term IR engagements. Next week, 15th February, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Rod Lache at the Wolfe Global Auto, Auto Tech, and Mobility Conference. 22nd February, Navin Kumar, CFO of Ford Pro, will participate in a fireside chat in Miami with Dan Levy at the Barclays Industrial Conference. We do plan to run this call about 15 minutes longer, so that'll take us to 15 minutes after the hour. We want to leave ample time for your questions. Jim, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nThank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last year turned out to be a fundamental year, a foundational year for our company. We launched some amazing.\n\nOperator\n\nPardon me, this is the conference operator. We've seen that we've lost audio from the speaker's location. Please stand by as we regain the signal. Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We have rejoined audio with the main speaker location, so please continue.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nHi, everyone. I'm not sure where we got cut off, but I wanted to just highlight how important last year was, not only financially, but a foundational year for our team. Our power of choice and our powertrains really came through. And you can really see that on the F-Series, which I'll talk about in a second. Our global hybrid sales were up 20% last year, and we expect them to be up 40% this year. We're now the number one and number two best-selling hybrid trucks in the US. Maverick is number one, and we're the number three hybrid brand in the US, behind Toyota and Honda. But unlike them, our hybrids really sell best on trucks for our side. We launched some awesome tech. BlueCruise just passed 150 million mi of hands-free use.\nBut more importantly, the growth is up 25% quarter-over-quarter, and the gross margins for BlueCruise are at 70+%. The same for Ford Pro Intelligence. And boy, can Ford do work vehicles. The new Super Duty and Transit are off to great starts, as is the new Ranger. We are really focused as a team on the segmentation. You can see the speed, the accountability for results, and focus within the company. And our underlying business is getting better. As John will show, despite the UAW strike, our auto profits were up year-over-year. We returned investment grade. We have higher ROIC, and we have really solid conversion from profits to cash. We're returning capital to shareholders. We're declaring a regular and a special dividend. And we're getting much more discipline on capital, not just where we allocate, but more importantly, how much we spend and when.\nOur integrated services are really accelerating under Peter Stern. These are high growth, high margin, as I said, and much less cyclical profits for us. We have one single leader, Kumar Galhotra, on our industrial system, and he is laser-focused on quality and cost. Our international operations have made a remarkable turnaround after a lot of difficult restructuring. It's the second year we've made profit. It's about a $3 billion turnaround compared to just three or four years ago. What would surprise people is what a juggernaut Ranger has become. It's a global franchise, and it's our second best-selling nameplate globally, just behind F-Series and ahead of Super Duty. Now, John's going to go into last year's results. It was a solid year. But I want to be really clear. We are nowhere near our earnings potential for Ford Motor Company.\nAnd we are really positioned well this year for growth and profitability for revenues as well. I'm going to cover four key areas. The first area is Ford Pro. It's nearly a $60 billion high-margin hardware, software, and physical services business. And most of that revenue is recurring. I believe Ford Pro is where the industry is going: an integrated business between all three of those factors. And we're seeing it first there because the customers use the vehicle more intensely and are more willing to pay for software. And we believe the attributes of Ford Pro are undervalued, but the performance will reveal that over time. And look at the performance last year. Ford Pro doubled its EBIT to $7 billion despite a significant slowdown on Super Duty during the launch in the name of quality. And we're now on track for mid-teen EBIT margins at Pro.\nYou're going to see top and bottom-line growth this year in Pro. We have the freshest product lineup in Ford's work history in two decades. Our order banks are exceeding our supply. The reason why that order bank is so strong is fundamentally different economic factors than our retail business. What I mean by that is look at North America. We're really dominant. We do really well on state and local government Pro sales. These are very profitable. Last year, state and local governments increased their spending by $75 billion, or 16%. A sizable portion of that is in infrastructure. People need Super Duty and Transits. Look at the build-out of telecom and 5G. It directly correlates to our robust revenues. The same is happening in the manufacturing sector in the US with reshoring or onshoring manufacturing. Dealers are clamoring for more Pro allocation.\nThey normally get only 50 to 75% of the volume they want. In Europe, it's the ninth straight year of Ford being the best-selling CV brand. We're just in the middle of launching the Super Duty for Europe, the Transit Custom, and the new Ranger is now ramping up. Why do we think we're undervalued in Pro? Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first is our market leadership is a little bit opaque. We don't just lead in Pro. We dominate. We're 40% of the market share of Class 1 through 7 full-size trucks and vans. In fact, many months, our second-place competitor isn't even half our size. Now, commanding that share means that we are dominant in vocations like service, construction, utility, and, as I said, government. But our biggest success is in TAMs, where the market's biggest: small and medium-sized businesses and tradespeople.\nThat's the backbone of the US economy. And boy, does Ford have a reputation with those customers. Our second big moat is upfitters. Again, very difficult for investors to see, but this is really significant. Every one of our landscapers, plumbers, electricians, they all upfit their Transits, Super Duty, and Rangers specific to their vocation. So these upfitters wind up being really important. We now have already developed a digital upfit integration system, and we share engineering specs with all those upfitters. We've been working with them for decades, and they really trust Ford. They're even able to move their upfit equipment from old Fords to new Fords. The third big moat is a growing one. It's software and our physical repair business. An example of that is, last year, we already have half a million active software paid subscriptions at Pro.\nIt's up 46%, and the margins are over 50%. In two years, we expect software and services to drive 20% of the Pro EBIT. That's supported by two things: getting to 60% mix on our connected vehicles and a threefold increase in our attach rates for those paid subscriptions that I mentioned, which are only at about 12% today. One of the biggest advantages we have in Pro that's hard for people to see is our physical repair network. It costs a lot of money to create, costs decades of time, and there's a lot of expertise. In the US, we have 23,000 service bays that are busy seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We're pressing on that advantage. Every day, we have new, very large service elite repair centers launching in the US. We haven't waited for brick and mortar.\nWe now have 1,200 vans and Super Duty that are outfitted for remote service to our fleet customers. The Net Promoter Score is 10 points higher because they don't have to come into the dealership. This has effectively added 10% more capacity for our service. The bottom line is we have these amazing vehicles. We have a leading market share position. We're now adding long-term durability to those products. We have highly profitable alternative revenue streams in repair and software now. Ford Pro is really a magical breakthrough for our customers and our company, and I believe the industry. Quality. We don't have to go into the negative effects about quality, but we've been addressing it for three years now, and we're starting to see progress.\nOur vision is that we want to give customers who buy our trucks and vans and our passion products, off-road, Bronco, and all of it, the long-term durability from companies like Toyota and Honda, but in the segments we compete in. We already have world-class quality in many parts of our company. Now we're seeing green shoots in North America. Kumar's leading this, and he's here for Q&A to answer any questions. But there are two aspects of quality I want to highlight. The first is launch quality. That Super Duty launch I mentioned was a line in the sand for this management team. We intensified all of our testing, our real-world problem-solving on the plant floor with our suppliers and engineers. We slowed down the launch, and boy, did it cost us $1 billion of EBIT we forego last year.\nBut it was the right trade-off for our company and our customers. The result is the launch spike that every launch has, we think, on Super Duty is now similar to best in class in our industry. We're seeing the benefits in the F-150 launch. That launch is underway right now, and it's a really important one for our company. The second area of quality we're seeing progress on is initial quality. Now, we measure that in three months in service. That is highly correlated to long-term quality and, yes, warranty costs. We saw last year a 10% increase. That is the largest improvement and the similar quality that we saw last time in 2016. It's the best in a long time. We're committing to a similar improvement this year. Quality now factors into 70% of the short-term incentives for our management at Ford.\nThe long-term, it's even more important because we're measuring total shareholder return. We will share those KPIs on quality with you every quarter. Next thing I'd like to highlight is EVs. Now, some have portrayed the change in the EV market as Darwinian. That could be a slow evolutionary change, but we think this has been a seismic change in the last six months of last year. That will rapidly sort out winners and losers in our industry. Now, the catalyst for that seismic change is a combination of EV manufacturers cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies, and a tremendous amount of capital flowing, and a ton of new capacity into one single segment: two-row crossovers. Our overall EV strategy has never been more relevant as a seismic change happens. We want to share with you our targets.\nOur next Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch. That will mean that we'll get to mid- to high single-digit EBIT profit margins over their life cycle. That's going to deliver profits above Model e's cost of capital. Here are our big bets and adjustments. We're going to spend less capital on larger EVs. As we've always said, we'll have a very small number of those. We're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage, like trucks and vans. Those products will have breakthrough efficiency compared to our Gen 1 products, and they're going to be packed with innovations that customers are going to be excited to pay for. We're also adjusting our capital and switching more focus onto smaller EV products.\nNow, this is important because we made a bet in silence two years ago. We developed a super talented Skunk Works team to create a low-cost EV platform. It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world, and it was separate from the Ford mothership. It was a startup. And they've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles, but will be a large install base for software and services that we're now seeing at Pro. All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs. And that bet, and all of the right-sizing of capital, and even delays to some of our products, given the market realities, better balance growth, profits, and returns for us.\nBut one of the things we're taking advantage of in taking some timing delays is rationalizing the level and timing of our battery capacity to match demand, and actually reassessing the vertical integration that we're relying on and betting on new chemistries and capacities. Our overall EV business will grow this year because we have the Explorer launching in Europe and really exciting. Many of our commercial vehicles launch with electric this year as we refresh the lineup. We will also align production and inventory for customer demands. EV customers are also helping us in a very critical area of software quality. They really, really are teaching us a lot. And this is a critical place where I think we're ahead as a company. Why are we making these changes in our EV business and capital allocation?\nWell, because we learned as an early leader as we scaled EVs and hybrids simultaneously. The demand curve turns out to be for EVs very different than ICE. We've seen explosive growth in EVs in 2021 and 2022. And we realized very quickly that our first three Gen 1 products, we didn't have enough capacity with EV growth, but as well importantly, the COVID supply shocks, the chip crisis itself, and Tesla's ability to make vehicles despite the chip crisis in 2021 and 2022 and the zero cost of capital gave us too optimistic of a demand signal at that time. And it drove a temporary spike in supply. As the COVID shock retreated, we learned that as you scale EVs to 5,000 to 7,000 units a month and you move into the early majority customer, they are not willing to pay a significant premium for EVs.\nThis was a huge moment for us. What we've seen, because we offer everything, is pricing quickly converged to hybrids after any benefit from subsidies. Now, Tesla found out this first, but we were right behind that. They were very exposed to the early majority. But we learned very quickly. And I want to say that no one will be immune to this reality. The most obvious indicator of this reality is looking at total revenue, not units for EVs. Look at the US market. EV total revenue was down in the second half of last year versus Q2. If you look at unit volumes, they were up. That is a really important insight we learned in being a first mover. The same thing happened in China. Same thing happened in Europe. Our data shows that EVs are a clear destination for many customers based on their unique duty cycle.\nIt's going to take time, more than we expected 18 months ago. But we are seeing big adoption variances by geography. That's why the power of choice at Ford is so important and a big advantage for us. We're betting that choice and flexible manufacturing is going to get us successfully through this transition. Look at the best-selling vehicle in the United States, the F-150. We have a Lightning, we have a Hybrid, and high volume, and an ICE choice. In Q4 in California, our mix was 50% hybrid and EV F-150 and 50% ICE. 1,000 miles away in Dallas, it was only 15% hybrid and EV, 85% ICE. You go around the world, you'll see same variations. Hybrids will play an increasingly important role in our industry's transition. We'll be here for the long run. Hybrid just fits specific customer use cases.\nOn a Maverick pickup truck, our hybrid is focused on mileage and efficiency, and they do the math very clearly. And they don't have to change the behaviors. On F-150 Hybrid, they get the same benefits even when they're towing on fuel efficiency, but we throw in Pro Power Onboard on top of that to displace a very expensive generator cost. And margins on hybrids are closer to ICE, much higher than EV margins. The journey on EVs is inevitable in our eyes. And we have a bright future in EVs. We're adjusting our capital, and we're giving customers choice. Last thing I want to mention is talent. None of these breakthroughs in our company operationally or financially or in technical excellence and innovation are going to happen without the right talent. And we've learned that the right talent is not sufficient.\nOver the last two years, it's been imperative that we go to a right performance management system. It's a fundamental change in the way we're running the company. We now truly differentiate and reward excellence at Ford, and that matches our operation and our business delivery. It's a massive culture change. Evolving to a compensation and benefit structure weighted more towards variable compensation that is tied to our delivery business results is fantastic. You can't bring in or retain the best talent without making this change. And now, our long-term incentives and our short-term incentives are tied specifically to shareholder value creation. Over to you, John.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nThanks, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. So 2023 was an important year as we continued to execute our Ford Plus plan.\nOur strong global product lineup, which is clearly resonating with our customers, delivered revenue of $176 billion, which was up 11%, marking our second consecutive year of double-digit growth. We delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT at the high end of our guidance, driven by continued strength in both Blue and Pro. Now, to provide some perspective, compared to last year collectively, our core business units, Pro, Model E, and Blue, improved EBIT by $2 billion, or 26%. This is after fully absorbing roughly $1.7 billion impact of the UAW strike. Free cash flow was $6.8 billion, generating a free cash flow conversion rate of 65%. This is above the top end of our target range and was driven by underlying strength in both Pro and Blue. Now, both of these metrics provide a good litmus test for the effectiveness of our Ford Plus strategy.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with nearly $29 billion in cash and more than $46 billion in liquidity. This provides considerable flexibility to manage our business as the industry continues to transform. With the improving trajectory of our business and strong free cash flow, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, plus a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share. This brings our payout ratio to 50% for the year, in line with our target to consistently return 40 to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Now, let's take a closer look at our performance. Revenue for the quarter was $46 billion, up 4%, despite the impact of the strike, which cost us roughly 90,000 units of production. Adjusted EBIT came in at $1.1 billion, with an EBIT margin of 2.3%, which again included the impact of the strike.\nNow, let's look at our segments. Ford Pro delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%. EBIT of $1.8 billion was up 25%, with a margin of 11.8%. Full year results clearly demonstrated the potential earnings power of this growth business. Revenue jumped 19%, and EBIT more than doubled year-over-year to $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4 billion. And with a margin of 12.4%, we're just shy of our mid-teen target. The strengths Jim highlighted for Ford Pro are differentiated and drove strong results this year and have Pro poised for another strong year in 2024. Ford Model e drove a 14% increase in wholesales in the quarter, a 2% increase in revenue, and EBIT loss of $1.6 billion. For the year, wholesales were up 20%, revenue was up 12%, and EBIT was a loss of $4.7 billion.\nBoth the quarter and year were impacted by challenging market dynamics and investments in next-generation vehicles, both of which Jim addressed in his remarks. In the quarter, Ford Blue revenue was flat despite the loss of roughly 60,000 units due to the strike. EBIT was $813 million with a margin of 3.1%. For the year, Ford Blue grew again with revenue up 8%. All of our regions are now profitable and contributing significantly to Blue's bottom line results. EBIT of $7.5 billion was up year-over-year with a margin of 7.3%. The improvement in EBIT reflects the underlying strength of our product portfolio, dampened by higher warranty and the UAW-related costs. Turning to Ford Credit. Ford Credit generated EBT of $280 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year. As expected, full year results were down year-over-year.\nCredit loss performance continues to normalize, but remains below our historical average. Now, before I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch briefly on capital allocation. One of the benefits of our segmentation, in addition to increased transparency and accountability, is that we are now allocating capital based on the growth opportunities in different risk and return profiles of our segments. This allows us to assign specific risk-adjusted hurdle rates for each of our businesses, driving greater accountability for returns on the capital we invest. So here's how we're thinking about 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect to earn between $10 to 12 billion in adjusted EBIT. The high end of the range would be a record for Ford, adjusted free cash flow of $6 to 7 billion, and capital expenditures of $8 to 9.5 billion, flat to moderately up year-over-year.\nSo let me double-click on capital expenditures. We expect EVs to be about 40% of the total, and this reflects products already in flight, including investments in EV powertrains, supporting our next generation of products and our LFP battery plant here in Michigan. As we continue to adjust to market dynamics, we are scrutinizing every dollar and will continue to drive efficiencies, targeting to land at the lower end of our CapEx range. For example, in 2023, we already started to take action. We delayed our second JV battery plant in Kentucky. We reduced the size of our new LFP plant in Michigan, and we did not proceed with our JV battery plant in Turkey.\nNow, we are further adjusting installed capacity to match demand, reassessing vertical integration and new battery chemistries, adjusting Gen 2 products and potentially their launch timing to ensure they meet our criteria for profitability given the new market reality. Our 2024 outlook also assumes a flat to slightly higher SAR in both the US and Europe, and our planning assumption for the US is 16 to 16.5 million units. Non-recurrence of the UAW strike, full year of our all-new Super Duty driving both positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro, industry supply and demand normalizing. Now, from a planning perspective, we are assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products.\nIn addition, we're assuming a $2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives that offset higher labor and product refresh costs. Within the segments, we expect Ford Pro strength will continue unabated. With continued strong demand for our leading products, we are targeting EBIT between $8 to 9 billion, driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. For Model e, we expect losses to widen to a range of $5 to 5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in our next-generation vehicles. We expect our first-generation vehicles to improve their profits throughout the year. Ford Blue, EBIT to be about equal to last year at $7 to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150. We also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product costs with efficiencies.\nWe expect Ford Credit's EBT to be up slightly year-over-year to about $1.5 billion. Now, taking a step back, our performance last year reflects the positive momentum of our Ford Plus plan. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products, and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. Now, that wraps up prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open up the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two.Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, everybody. Jim, I want to talk to you about Ford versus Ferrari, which is, by the way, a great movie, by the way, and I think the good guys won. I remember a time when Fiat owned Ferrari, and I had a valuation of about $4 billion on it. Now, Ferrari is worth $80 billion today. The business was totally ignored by investors when it was part of Fiat. Now, Ford is a Ferrari. It's called Ford Pro. I think we agree people are ignoring the cash cow, but I disagree with you, Jim. You said it's because of opaque kind of transparency or opaque kind of metrics. I don't agree. I think it's because almost all the profits are funding this EV science project.\nAm I being unfair, Jim, with that kind of assessment, or what can your team do about this? Have a follow-up.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nEnthusiasm towards it. But relative to EVs, there's a lot we can do, and there's a lot we're doing. I think you're going to see a lot of seismic changes in the industry because of this pricing power reality that we've all faced. More OEM relationships, different shifting to a buy versus a build or vertical integration, shifting in capital, and generally more focus on smaller vehicles. The EV customers are very robust. They really like the vehicles. They do not repurchase ICE or hybrid vehicles. They're very loyal, and they love the vehicles. So it's on us to get the cost right. That is the issue with the transition.\nThe good news is Ford has a high-volume hybrid business, and the timing of a second-cycle product gives us the chance to make a lot of adjustments in capital, bring it down, including. And it allows us to execute them with a cost approach that's very different than our first generation. I think all of our commitments to make money in the first 12 months of all of our launches, to have that kind of profitability in Model E, to return its cost to capital. I wouldn't be saying if I didn't believe it. It's also got a lot of other benefits, which I want the team to explain, Adam, that are really important to understand. Marin, maybe you want to go over those, or John?\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nSure. Thanks, Jim.\nIf we just think about what the Gen 1 vehicles can do for us, we're building the EV business, and at the same time, we need the compliance value. We mentioned before the value of the credits that generated allow us to sell these high-margin ICE vehicles. Each EV sold allows us to sell multiple high-margin vehicles. A Lightning can offset roughly, including Pro, including Pro. We're also building new customer-facing capabilities. We are satisfying demand that is out there where there's high levels of adoption. We've got new dealer standards, changing experience for the customer for shop and buy, ownership, and service so that we're learning what's required to serve these customers, both us and our dealers. We're developing a charging network through our dealers and together with Tesla. Now, the adoption varies tremendously by geography.\nAs Jim mentioned, across the West Coast, we're seeing 30% of the market in F-150 being in EVs. That volume is giving us a feedback loop for engineering. We're developing these electric powertrains. We've got better handle on thermal propagation, and the software and services that these customers demand much more intensely than a typical ICE customer, we're learning how to deliver those much better, much more efficiently, and with higher quality. I would be remiss if we ignored the lifetime value of both the customer and the vehicle. We've got a 60% conquest rate on Gen 1, and the integrated services like BlueCruise that we can sell on these vehicles goes through the whole life of the vehicle.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nAnything else, John? Thank you.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nYeah. I mean, the only thing I would say is, Adam, one of the important things just on top of that is that the segmentation is really important here. And we know that the EV business needs to stand on its own, right? We're very clear about that. And it needs to generate a profit and a return on the capital we're investing. Now, we're not there yet, but that's what we're working towards. The compliance benefit that we get, that's important. We can sell up to a dozen ICE F-150s or other ICE profitable vehicles for every Lightning we sell. But we don't do anything with wooden nickels. We don't do any credits into Model E or anything like that because eventually this business has to stand on its own sooner rather than later. And that's a really important point. It's clean. By the way, Pro includes electric.\nAlthough electric is going slower for Pro customers, it's actually they do the math quicker than retail customers. So actually, our January EV sales in Pro were higher than December, which would never make sense. But we're seeing more and more Pro customers go electric if their duty cycle makes sense. So even for Pro, it's important for our success. I appreciate that, Jim. I just have a brief follow-up on China. You guys come across as very sophisticated in terms of having sophisticated insight into China. You got Ambassador Huntsman on the board, been there for years. You have a JV partner with Changan that's really kicking ass lately with EVs. So how can Ford potentially work with China, Chinese partners, to help Ford achieve its EV objectives in a more capital-efficient way? Thanks.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nThank you.\nWell, the person right next to me, John, was the head of Ford in China and knows the Changan leadership really well. John and I went to a Gemba trip last spring, and it was really eye-opening for us. I mean, as two leaders who looked at each other and said, \"Holy cow.\" I think, first of all, China as an export for our very profitable overseas markets is really important now. Actually, we shouldn't overlook the importance of JMC now. We have really profitable export business from China, ICE, and EV. We're going to actually have a very different strategy, I think, our competitors in China with a very low capital approach to EVs. We see the kind of bloodbath reality now in China and EVs, and we're watching that really carefully.\nWe don't think it's a good time to jump in with both feet in China with EVs, but we're allowing our partners' platforms to lead our electrification. And in doing that, we are learning a lot about their capability and the local IP there in China. And it's pretty breathtaking to see what we're learning. I think our approach of very low-capital, profitable business is appropriate at this moment in time for this kind of EV explosion, but also bloodbath and profitability. And I think we're also building a global capability team for digital experience, battery and sensing tech, and product concepting in China that we'll use globally. I think even though that's not a profit or loss thing, we see that as a real capability globally. So our strategy is quite different, but I think it works for our company.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood evening, guys. Just a first question here, Jim, on EVs. Obviously, that's the hot topic here. As we look at sort of the slowdown here, we're hearing from dealers, particularly, I spent some time in NADA last week, that they're seeing EVs traded in and folks buying ICE and EVs. So they're actually swapping out of EVs and buying ICE and hybrids. I say ICE and hybrids. And then you're seeing Hertz dumping 20,000 EVs and canceling or postponing orders. So both on the retail side and the commercial side, you're getting these stories that's following up with data that folks are really not happy with the product sort of near-term. I mean, what do you think is happening because the customers are not happy?\nI mean, it sounds like on the Pro side, some folks might be with the product that they have right now. And if you think about sort of your planning assumptions, maybe near-term, I don't just for argument's sake, say you have 100,000 less EVs. Do you think if you sell 100,000 less EVs at Ford that you have the ICE and hybrids to backfill for that so you actually don't lose sales and you actually may be a little bit more profitable in the short-term? It's kind of a lot in that question, but just trying to understand what you're seeing in the market, why things are failing here, both on the retail side and on the commercial side to some degree, and you have the product to backfill as those volumes are lower. You can imagine,\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nJohn, you can imagine thank you for your question.\nYou can imagine with our choice portfolio being big on scaled hybrids, ICE, of course, and EV; this is a very fundamental question for us because we have to plan our capacity years out. Here's what we found. Customers are doing the quick showroom math on hybrids. They can quickly evaluate the break-even between an ICE and a hybrid. On the showroom floor for an F-150, they know how much a Honda generator costs versus Pro Power Onboard, and they don't have to change their behavior. A lot of the operating cost efficiencies of EV for a mainstream customer require change, like installing a charger at home, or they're uncertain. How much will I save on repair costs? How much will I save on electrons versus gasoline? It's harder to compare.\nWe're just seeing the cost of ownership, which is interesting because the success of EVs and Pro is a customer that does that math more brutally, and they use the vehicle in a higher utilization. So they're looking at cost of ownership in a much clearer lens. Therefore, some of them are doing the math and going to EV. I think that math has always been there for HEV, but now more customers are interested in doing that. We believe that customers are smart, and some people with duty cycles for EVs are going to do that math over time, and it's worth investing because it's a really good business. But it's on us to get the cost right. So I just think we're seeing the math for an EV customer, mainstream EV customer, is a little bit more opaque than what we see on hybrid.\nMarin, you want to say anything quickly about dealers?\n\nMarin Gjaja\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nYeah. I think what we're seeing with our dealers is they've been making margins comparable to their ICE vehicles in the last year. In 2021 and 2022, we're actually doing better than on their ICE vehicles when pricing was really strong. So we feel really good about making sure our dealers are making money on this, and they're making investments for the long-term. But I think that's something that we monitor closely. I think just building on Jim's point quickly, I would just say the big difference for consumers is they make that one choice every few years, whereas the Pro customer is changing their fleet consistently, buying lots of vehicles, and they test and they learn what the TCO difference is, that total cost of operation.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nAs far as the manufacturing capacity, we planned that 40% growth in HEVs years ago. So that is our capacity. Now, we may have some pricing room above that, and we've seen actually HEV pricing become more robust as we hit these capacity limits. But 40% growth is a big increase for us. We think we got it about right. That means on an F-150, America's best-selling vehicle, we think 25% of the sales for America's best-selling vehicle is going to be hybrid. And I think we're going to get close to some of the all-hybrid nameplates out there that people think of when they think of hybrids with F-150. So we have a lot of flexibility. I think we're in good shape.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nJim, just one follow-up. I mean, you're reported to or rumored to be doing a two-week tour to your dealers, around to your different dealers. I'm just curious. I mean, some of them are happy. Some of them are annoyed at the EV stuff. What is the general message going to be as you're going around to the all-important channel and trying to get the troops in line and everything moving in the right direction in the distribution channel?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nA couple of key messages. First of all, I mentioned Ford Pro and what a profit juggernaut that is. We continue to need our dealers to invest in the brick and mortar and those remote service vans and accelerate that because that is the upside. We want to get to if we want to get to 20% of the profit for Pro being attached services; it's going to have to come on the back of capacity in our dealers and vans. So invest in Pro.\nThe second thing is we have manufacturing flexibility between ICE, EV, and hybrid. So we want to make sure that they understand that we're in probably better shape than any other brand in this transition. The third message is we want them to understand our progress on quality, and we are going to press to be among the leaders in retailing efficiency for our customer, remote pickup and service, doing more repairs for our retail customers remote. And that takes investment on their side. We really want to step on the gas on customer experience, both ownership and purchase. And I think that has to come from the top. Jim Farley has to say to all those dealers who are private investors, \"We need your partnership right now.\" That's why I'm going on the tour. Sounds good.\n\nJohn Murphy\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, everybody. Jim, you said that you're discovering that the adoption curve for EVs is a bit shallower, but we're still seeing $5 to 5.5 billion of losses in Model E, which implies that structural costs are probably higher in 2024 than 2023. So it sounds like you're committed because you see the ultimate benefit and maybe also a little bit because there isn't much choice. So ultimately, the question is, can you control and commit to when that business reaches break-even, either through stronger demand or lower spending? Because from here, $5 billion improvement is pretty meaningful. Or do you have to do that because of the trajectory of ZEV, EPA, and all the other things possibly exceeding where consumers are?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nWell, we're not going to go to market with a vehicle unless we completely convinced ourselves that it's going to be profitable. That takes some adjustments on timing, actually. We see opportunity in the short-term to make some adjustments. But yeah, I know it's a huge turnaround, and it's a big number. John, maybe you want to go into the actual losses in Model e just to pick them apart a little bit, and then I think you'll see a little bit more about the opportunity we have with Gen 2.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nYeah. So the biggest issue we have in our Gen 1 vehicles, of course, is that the revenue collapsed, and they're not optimized from a cost standpoint. We put them through very quickly to get to market, and you're seeing that flow through.\nBut I think, Rod, part of what you were getting at is that we have no choice. We will continue to work on improving the cost structure of the Gen 1 vehicles. And as Jim said, our Gen 2 vehicles, we won't launch unless we can get to a profit and a return on that capital that we're investing there at the pricing environment that we now understand is reality. So yes, it is very much the mother of all optimization, modeling, and work around the balance between how many EVs we sell because we talked about the compliance benefits of that. For every Lightning, we can sell 12 ICE vehicles. We can sell a number of ICE vehicles with every Mach-E we sell. And so there's that balance.\nAnd then there's the balance of what we need to sell from the ICE standpoint and how we can improve with HEVs there. And that's a benefit too. But there's also, and you'll see that in our K tomorrow, we are buying credits as they're available. So we have to optimize across all three of those frontiers, and that's what we're working on right now. But we know that we have to have this electric vehicle business stand on its own and be profitable because we know that there are competitors out there. We talked about that, the Chinese as well as Tesla that are profitable. And we have to cross that fulcrum and get there. And that's what our goal is. So it needs to be a benefit of profitable business, return on the capital, plus the compliance benefit that we get from those.\nAnd Rod, we have a lot of stakeholders at Ford, so we're not going to go into a lot of details, but we have optionality even this year in capital spending. I mean, a lot of that guide is EVs. John, I don't know if you want to be specific, but about 40%. It was about 40% last year, and 40% of our CapEx this year is EV. And we're driving as a team to be on the low end of that range. Absolutely. Because we are working hard on our EV spend. And I just want to make sure we don't want to leave this call with the fact that this is totally baked. We are working really hard to be on the low end of that range because we think it's appropriate to run the business.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nCan you commit to break-even at a certain point? You said before that the Gen 2 vehicles come out in 2026. Is that kind of the timeline for closing that $5 billion? And then just as a follow-up, I think you're saying that you've got line of sight on warranty coming down. Will we see the variable cost disadvantage that you've highlighted in warranty and material starting to come down this year?\nWe have the leader of our EV business here, Marin. So I think that question goes to you on timing and warranty.\n\nMarin Gjaja\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nYeah. I don't think we're prepared right now to commit to a specific timing on when we're going to be positive EBIT. We are going to expect to see improving gross margin quarter-over-quarter over the course of the year. John mentioned some of the levers we're starting to pull, and we will continue to adjust to the market realities. We've changed our production.\nWe have increased CNI as need be to address our inventory issues. We're going to keep working on our cost. We've taken 4,000 to 5,000 out of the BOM on Mustang Mach-E since it was launched and 2,000 to 3,000 out of Lightning, and the team continues to work. But the market has turned, and it's going to be a challenge. I don't know that we can commit because we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the market. In terms of warranty costs, our Generation 1 vehicles, as we mentioned earlier, have been incredibly valuable for us to learn about a set of the issues around EVs, batteries, and thermal propagation. We will continue to work on that to lower our warranty costs dramatically for Generation 2, but we've got to deliver that in partnership with Kumar and the industrial platform.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nSo Rod, I think the last part of your question was around, are we going to start to see costs turn? I would say that from a warranty standpoint, costs are probably going to be about flat this year. We're starting to see green shoots on the quality improvements, but as you know, the way that works, there's a lag. And Kumar can touch upon this a little bit more, but this year, we expect to see $2 billion of efficiencies flow through. And those efficiencies are in the material cost and the industrial system, pretty much offsetting the impact of the UAW. But also, remember, 60% of our global portfolio this year will be refreshed. And coming with that will be incremental costs that we have for new features, compliance, etc.\nWhat we should see this year is the efficiencies of $2 billion offsetting the UAW labor contract plus the refresh costs of 60% of our products being refreshed this year.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I want to go back to Pro. The guide that you have for this year is already in line with the mid-teen margin guide you provided at your CMD last spring. So really, the question is, how sustainable is this earnings stream? Specifically, I think you've had something like $7 billion of price tailwinds last year, I think $11 billion if you aggregate over a two-year stretch.\nI know this is partially driven by new product, but what is the sustainability of these very robust price tailwinds you experience?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nWell, first of all, I try to explain the fundamental factors for our vehicle profitability in Pro that's driving that demand will be here for a while. It's basic infrastructure, government, state, 5G, onshoring, manufacturing, the manufacturing sector. We believe that that's very durable. And by the way, in Europe, we've been a top-selling brand there for nine years, and we have very old products. So we haven't even seen the effect of Transit Custom and Ranger. That's all coming our way. We feel that this is a pretty robust profitability because we've never had the 20% attach rates. We've never had a half a million units of software with 50% margins. We've never really focused on Pro after-sales like we are now.\nWe're just getting started with this 20% of the profitability coming from attached services. I think that totally changes the risk portfolio of our commercial business. This is a real opportunity for our company that we never had. I also believe that that attach rates are the kind of things that we'll start to see on the retail side of our business. Blue software is now 70% margin, and it's high volume now. We're just getting started with that optionality. So what it will be five years from now, I'm not sure the timeframe of your question, hard to predict, but for the next couple of years, we're in a really good spot because the shovels are in the ground or about to get in the ground.\nThe one other thing about Pro that we have to watch really carefully, which would be even more upside, is a return to a robust construction housing market, which has been really low in the last couple of years. If that starts to fire up, we're going to even have more capacity issues on Pro. Great.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Thanks. Then as a follow-up, John, I want to go back to your comments that you just mentioned a second ago on the industrial costs. And specifically, I think at the CMD, you talked about a $7 billion cost disadvantage versus your competitors in blue. So how do we contextualize the cost improvements that you're getting now versus the $7 billion? I mean, is it safe to say that now this journey on sort of narrowing that gap is starting, or is it still just a lot more work to do? Just help us understand the path to narrowing that cost gap versus your competitors in blue.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nYeah. What I would say is that now we're starting to gain the traction, and that gap should start to narrow. And that's part of the $2 billion. And so it's going to be across the industrial system, both in material and in labor. And I think Kumar can share some more details of how he's leading that and driving that.\n\nKumar Galhotra\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. Well, this year, we're starting very differently than 2024, than 2023, for example. A couple of fundamental different things. Last year, we had a lot of inflationary pressures and claims from our suppliers. Those have eased very substantially and are going to help us deliver the $2 billion that John talked about. The second thing is the supply chain is much more stable.\nThat allows us to run our entire system much more smoothly and helps us remove a lot of waste. It also reduces a lot of our freight costs because we've been doing a lot of premium freight the last couple of years. That'll help as well. In terms of material, we're attacking it in three different ways. One is where our designs are not efficient. Let me give you a bit of color and a couple of examples. In one of our vehicle lines, we were using certain aero shields for fuel economy. They fresh eyes'd Kaizen review internally and some benchmarking. The team came up with a different way of delivering the same aero and saved $40 per vehicle. That's equivalent to about $10 million per year.\nAnother category is where we're providing certain features to our customers where they're not finding a lot of value. Connected vehicle data here is very important because it helps us see what we're providing, whether the customers are using it or not. One example is an auto park feature that lets the customer parallel park automatically. Very, very few people are using it. We can remove that feature. It's about $60 per vehicle, another $10 million per year. We're doing very extensive benchmarking for our manufacturing, both internally because we have lots of good ideas within our system and externally at a station-by-station level. Just recently, one of the teams completed an analysis of about 50 stations and saved about $8 million. I already mentioned the freight.\nSo these are the kinds of very robust ideas we have in the hopper, along with less inflationary claims, along with a stable supply chain that's going to help us close that gap that John mentioned and save $2 billion this year.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAuto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks so much. I was actually hoping to pick it up just where you left off on all the good color on the cost side. Are there any green shoots that you can sort of point us to to give us increased conviction around some of these costs? Obviously, in 2023, costs were still a fairly major drag, and that includes even in the fourth quarter. In your reporting, any of these buckets that we should be watching in terms of what we'll actually provide to tailwind the $2 billion+ in 2024?\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nIt's just fundamentally the things I talked about. We have a very robust hopper of ideas that we're very busy executing: stability in supply chain, removing a lot of waste, and freight costs. We spent a lot of money; all of us did in premium freight. We're starting to see in Q3 and Q4 a much more stable supply chain that allows us not to spend that premium and bring those costs down in 2024. Emmanuel, the other thing I would add to that is that when you look at 2022 and 2023, we were very much behind the curve with the supply base, catching up to where they were and understanding what was driving their inefficiencies and claims.\nWe spent a lot of time in 2023 getting out in front of that. I would say that we ended 2023 with the great work that Liz has done to be in a very different place with our supply base. Now we're working together with them very proactively across Kumar's industrial system to identify efficiencies, things that we can change to help them, and, as Kumar said, design actions, etc., things like that that will make them more efficient as well. That's another bit of color to add to that.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAuto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks so much. Just quick follow-up on this. Will these things take time to play out? I guess I'm looking at your fourth quarter walk, and material and freight was still a $1 billion headwind.\nSo, curious if you would need a number of quarters and then it would be a bit more back-end loaded or if we could sort of turn on the switch and see some of these benefits in 2024. And then, secondly, curious about your thoughts about the volume outlook for this year, especially for Ford Blue. I think some of the inventory days are sort of towards the higher end of what you've historically been comfortable with. And so I'm wondering where you see volume go for this year.\n\nJim Farley\n\nPresident and CEO, Ford\n\nYeah. So a lot in there. What I think you should see from a calendarization standpoint on the cost for 2024 is that you'll see, as Kumar said, a lot of these are the design actions we've been working to identify in 2023 that have built up this cadre of actions we call the hopper.\nThose will start coming through on the model year turnover. So more towards the middle of the year, you'll start to see a lot more traction there on those. Some of the manufacturing improvements you'll see throughout the quarters, probably a little bit more of an even flow of those, I would say, right, Kumar? And so that's where we're at.\n\nKumar Galhotra\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nWhen you look at our day supply, when you look at our blue day supply, retail dealer day supply is in the low to mid-50s. So it's at about the limit of where we expect it to be. So leaning back then into volume, we expect the industry to be for the year, we expect it to be about 16 to 16.5, so maybe up 3 to 4% for us from a wholesale standpoint, about that. From a planning perspective, that's where we're at.\nFrom a pricing perspective, we're planning to see about a 2% decline, negative pricing. Then when you step back and you look at that from an affordability standpoint, we think 2024 is the year where affordability is going to get back to pre-pandemic levels, where the monthly disposable income it takes to buy a vehicle should be back to about that 13 to 13.5%, which is what we saw before the pandemic. So we're going to continue to see some top-line pressure on blue. We've got new product coming in blue, which is going to give us some mix and some tailwind there. So that's going to be a positive for blue. Then I think Jim covered off Pro. We're seeing incredible demand on Pro. And as you know, Emmanuel, those commercial orders come in two tranches. Half of them came in last year, so they're all set.\nThe other half are coming through now, and we're continuing to see strength there. Thanks so much. I'm sure that Portia is going to be freshened or new by the year end.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAuto Technology Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Great. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector, BNP Paribas\n\nHi. Good evening, everyone. Just wondering if you could help to mention EV volumes for this year associated with the $5 billion+ in Model e losses. And then with respect to Ford Pro's mid-teens margins this year, just curious on the impact tied to the fleet demand for EVs beyond general companies, of course. Do you foresee a step up in Pro EV volumes for the year? No Model e losses get more difficult. So just how are you thinking about the EV dynamic for Pro profitability as well? Thanks.\n\nKumar Galhotra\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nOn the retail side, I'll ask Marin to answer that. On Pro, absolutely, our EV sales will grow, not only because we're seeing more interest, because the cost of ownership is advantageous for some fleet, but we're also expanding in Europe quite a bit, our electric offering with our two Transit vans coming online. And so that will definitely, and there are a lot of city closures and other kind of regulations in Europe that's driving adoption for electric vehicles, especially vans specifically. So yes, we'll have very robust growth in our EVs for Pro.\n\nMarin Gjaja\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nYeah. And we expect growth in sales on the retail side as well. Remember, we had times where we were out of production last year on Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. So we'll be overlapping those. We'll see growth. And then, more importantly, we're launching Explorer in Europe in the second half of this year. So that's going to be a new offering that will help us grow. So we expect to see substantial unit volume growth.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector, BNP Paribas\n\nGot it. And John, I know you touched on this already, but are supplier cost reductions a core component of $2 billion in savings for the year? Just wondering how commercial negotiations have progressed, and are there any areas that stand out in terms of opportunity? Thanks.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nYeah. A lot of the $2 billion is, again, through the manufacturing system. So it's the industrial efficiencies that we've been working on. And then from a design and material standpoint, it's mostly design reductions that are part of the $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. So it's those actions that we've been benchmarking and working on, similar to the ideas that Kumar had described, pretty much design-related. It's design, labor, and freight, primarily.\n\nJames Picariello\n\nDirector, BNP Paribas\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question today comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I mean, obviously, a strong guide in aggregate. Digging into, though, the higher anticipated Model E losses of $5.5 billion, what is embedded within that from a variable contribution margin perspective? How do you expect that to progress throughout 2024? And then could we also check in a little bit longer-term on how you're feeling about that Model E margin target of, I think it's 8% by the end of 2026 annualized, right? Including after GM recently lowered their 2025 EV margin target. And given that, I think you rolled out that 8% before Tesla cut their prices and saw their overall margin actually decline to be basically in line with yours. If you're still targeting 8% with the 2024 guide out there now, it's really only 2025.\nIt's the mystery. So it seems like quite the step up then over the course of 2025 and 2026. I know you do expect a big boost from those second-generation EVs you discussed earlier, but in comparison to the mixed fuel models. But is that enough to get you to the 8%, or are there other sources of improvement that need to layer in over 2025 and 2026? I don't know, vertical integration, or what are those sources of savings, and how are you feeling about that target? Thank you.\n\nJohn Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford\n\nYeah. So I think it's clear, given the dynamics in the marketplace and the way the top lines come down significantly since we had put that out there, that the 8% is not on in the 2026 time period. So I think that's clear. I don't think anybody believes that by 2026 we can bridge from here to 8%.\nIt's going to come down to launching our next generation of vehicles and improving the contribution margin, gross margin, as Marin had said, on the first generation as we go through the year. But Marin, do you want to add more color to that?\n\nMarin Gjaja\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nJohn, I think that's right. I think it's really the levers we're pulling this year to improve gross margin over time on Gen 1 and then really sticking to the capital discipline and the operating discipline around launching Gen 2 only when they can be profitable and deliver the kind of returns we want. And over time, that'll build a standalone profitable EV business. Thanks.\n\nRyan Brinkman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nMarin Gjaja\n\nCOO, Ford\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2023 earnings call.\nWith me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Stern, President, Ford Integrated Services. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.\nToday's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.forward.com.\nOur discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause results to differ are included on Page 20.\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nExecutive VP & President-Global Markets, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.\nI wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers. I'm so pleased for our employees. This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants. I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work. Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business. Right now, we're focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers.\nIt's been a challenging situation, for sure. Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions. But I am more excited and motivated than ever. Our team is making tremendous progress every day towards building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services. We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers. We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation. We're building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability. We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution.\nIn a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed. The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results. But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business.\nNow, last week, we made some important leadership changes. Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, Chief of our EV, Digital, and Design Officer, to move us forward. I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A. These are my top 2 priorities.\nOverall, we are seeing the clear benefits of creating 3 distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro. The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength. Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid. Ford is America's best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator. In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S. will be new and refreshed next year. I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market. In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that's based on it continued to gain share in international markets. So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come. We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is a moving target. I'm optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice. I've been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we're working on. Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career. Let me be specific. Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office. Take the wheels off this truck, and it's still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized. I'd take this truck 7 days of the week over a Cybertruck.\nA great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost. Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y. They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second and third cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction. While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs. The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries. So let's double-click on each of these 3.\nOn scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation. We're leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality. We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability. Yeah, we're designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team.\nOn vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change. We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford. In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%. This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure will allow us to significantly reduce material cost. Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you've seen our competitors struggle as they build-out and ramp-up these capabilities. So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey.\nAnd finally, batteries. They're the single biggest cost component of any EV. Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range. And with our LFP batteries, we'll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S. Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability. These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024. And this is also a significant cost reduction.\nI saved Ford Pro for the last because it's a massive driver of Ford's growth and profitability. Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we've built over many decades for our Pro business won't be easy to cross. The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions. Our commercial order banks are healthy. This may be a surprise to everyone. We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects. Thank you, 5G and road-works. And we have very loyal customers.\nFleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year's orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total. In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe. Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe. It's a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe. And it's a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there. When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear. Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course. And we're building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality. This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations. And I've asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business. His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability. He's already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers. There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro.\nI want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction. The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable. We are now expanding China's role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro. We've already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia. There is so much more opportunity ahead for us. Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln.\nFinally, I'm so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro. Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software. There's simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us.\nPeter, over to you.\n\nPeter C. Stern\n\nPresident of Integrated Services\n\nThanks, Jim.\nI've spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy. As you said, it's literally the plus in Ford+. Now, over 2 months in, I'm even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that's working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments. We're making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating.\nOver the past couple of months, we've identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers' lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise. This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before. It will drive new high margin, acyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers. And we'll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice. Whether you choose to add our services or not, you'll have an amazing vehicle.\nOur momentum around software and services is building fast. Here are three examples. First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford's industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership. Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past 6 months, both contributing to strong revenue growth. And we're still in the early stages of our rollout. We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year-over-year. And we have an ambitious product road-map for Pro. For example, over the next few weeks, we'll launch the Ford Pro dashcam. This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving. While we're still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we'll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford.\nSecond, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services. This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts. So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off. And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today. Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day. If you haven't felt what it's like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it. Launch to-date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles. That's the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well. Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving. And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0. BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, 5 times longer than version 1.0. Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof.\nDespite these encouraging successes, what we're about to do in Integrated Services won't be easy. Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected. We must also round-out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies. Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer. We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers. And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies, but also new measures of success.\nSo, as we progress in our services evolution, you're going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription. And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits. There's incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I'm proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history.\nJohn, over to you.\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Peter.\nThrough the first 3 quarters, we delivered $9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business. Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on-track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion. With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp-up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects. And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant. This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly $1.3 billion. Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance.\nSo, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again -- it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future. Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient. Wholesales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $2.2 billion with a margin of 5%; both improved year over year. However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down year-over-year, driven by unfavorable working capital. Through the first nine months, we generated $4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range. Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption. We ended the quarter with over $29 billion in cash and $50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new $4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment.\nNow, turning to our customer-focused segments. Ford Pro generated EBIT of $1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%. Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that's reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power. In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years. We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter.\nRegarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred $1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products. Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand. For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky. And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward. In fact, all told, we have pushed about $12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense. The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market.\nTurning to Ford Blue. In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion, up $300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs. The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation. Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success. Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we've had in place now for almost 2 decades. We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the US, thanks to Maverick and F-150. We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies. The F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains. And hybrids aren't just limited to North America as we are launching a [indiscernible] Ranger for Europe and IMG next year.\nFord Credit generated EBIT of $358 million. As expected, our results were down year-over-year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average, but continues to normalize. Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations.\nFinally, turning to software and services. We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build-out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation.\nIn closing, there's obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I'm confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. And operator, please open the line for questions.",

My name is Andy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director-Investor Relations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, MJ, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit and Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro.\nToday's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. taxes in the appendix of the earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 26. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted.\nA quick update some upcoming IR before I turn the call over to Jim. On Thursday, August 10, Ford prone will do a fireside sat at the Safer Automotive Conference in New York with Auto Brinkman. And on Wednesday, September 27, our Treasury, Dave Web, will participate in a green financing panel at the Goldman Sachs Global Sustainability Forum.\nBefore I turn it over to Jim, I just want to recognize one really important individual investor call, and that's my mom, who has listened to every single one of our Ford Investor Relations call since I joined. She is a tough cookie and always gives us a good working over after we do the call. So I just want to say I'm welcome to being on the call.\nJim, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nExecutive VP & President-Global Markets, Ford Motor Co.\n\nWell, first, mom, thank you for Lynn. Thanks to all of you for joining us on the May Capital Markets event, where we shared our vision to refound our 120-year-old American icon and create a Ford pride at this exciting between great vehicles and digital experiences.\nNow the world is changing fast, but I have never been more confident in our Ford+ plan. As you've heard, our intention is to match the tightening long-term vision Ford with boringly able execution quarter after quarter, year after year. And that's the biggest takeaway from our second quarter: strong growth, strong earnings, cash flow and progress on the fundamentals of our business, including software. We are very bullish on the potential for Ford Pro, which had an outstanding quarter. It's unique to Ford. It's a true powerhouse.\nAt the same time, Ford Blue is taking advantage of fresh, appealing products to generate healthy revenues, healthy share and profits, while Model E continues to scale with popular, first-generation electric vehicles. We're going to dive more into the electric vehicle market during Q&A. But clearly, this transition to EVs is economic and so much more than just a change proposal.\nThe number of global entrants is increasing even at the high end and the pricing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 60 days. Despite these puts and takes, we have counted the underlying trajectory of Ford's business. Our portfolio of business is strong, thanks to businesses like Pro and Blue, and we are raising our estimated EBIT guidance this year to $11 billion to $12 billion.\nOperationally, we continued focused on capital discipline, solid returns even as we face uncertainties in the external environment. Supply chain disruptions are persistent, but they're now easy. And we have more work to do to streamline our industrial system, reducing costs and improving quality.\nWhile EV adoption is still growing, the paradigm has shaped. EV price premiums over internal combustion vehicles fell more than $3,000 in the second quarter and nearly $5,000 in first half. We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out, and we are confident from a brand, from our incredible product strategy, our software, our scale and our cost position, we will be one of the winners on firm.\nBut why do I say that? We moved quickly to establish our EV nameplates in unique segments, not like others, the Lightning, the Maki, the ETrans. We're building EV brand lowers. It's critical. Many of our EV customers are all new to Ford. This is a significant asset to Ford given our new Gen 2 products and profitability that we'll be launching soon.\nFor Gen 2, we focused on fewer, higher volume in the right segments to take advantage of our strengths, knowledge of customers, even Conquest customers. For example, work vehicles, pickups for retail customers and spacious 7-passenger SUVs. I am so glad we didn't bet the farm on 2 robust robbers or the like EV platforms, like so many have. We moved early on LFP, especially production in the U.S., giving us a diversity of chemistry cost advantage.\nWe are now offering Mach-E with LFP technology for sale in the U.S. With the addition of Tesla Superchargers and the Fast Chargers that our dealers are installed, the Blue Oval charging network will be the single large integrated fast charge network across the U.S. and Canada, and this blanket coverage from tens of thousands of fast chargers is core to our strategy. It helps us be smaller, lower cost and faster charging batteries.\nWe have the flexibility to offer customers choice of ICE, hybrids and full electrics in the years to come. Our hybrid offerings are extremely popular. F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 46 years, 10% of all F-150s and 56% of all Mavericks sold in the U.S. are sold as hybrids. We are adding hybrid options across our each lineup, and we expect to quadruple our hybrid sales in the next 5 years, and we're already #2 in the market last year.\nStarting January 1, we moved to a new retail model for Fable, way ahead of our competition. Again, a differentiated model that will deliver non-negotiated sites, a simple shopping and ownership experience and remote services for all of our customers. This is critical to a conquest digital brand. And finally, with these new models, we are nimble and we can adapt to the market fluctuations real time, and you've seen this with both the Mach-E and the Lightning as we are adding enormous capacity to meet pent-up demand.\nWe are optimizing for the long-term value creation. More than 60% of Mach-E and half of Lightning customers are new to Ford. These new customers have significant lifetime value potential beyond because of the shippable software. But we are disciplined as we grow, and we won't bear an unlimited cost to acquire those customers and build our installed base.\nIn line with that, we are now targeting to reach 600,000 annual production units of EVs by next year, and we maintain flexibility on where we reach when we reach 2 million total EV global capacity because we are balancing growth, profitability and returns. At the same, we believe demand for our internal combustion and our hybrid portfolio will be durable with the window of growth in Ford Blue potentially longer and richer than most expected. We've proven we can design and develop popular vehicles that stand out from the competition irregardless of their propulsion, and we made sure Ford is profitable as we move through this ICE EV transition.\nSo let me cover a few highlights for each of our business segments. The appeal in pricing power of Ford Blues, iconic vehicles, those Mustang lineups, the Maverick, the F-150, the Explorers, all those cool, new derivatives from Ford, boy, these products remain strong. Ford was America's #1 brand in the first half of this year. Also in the first half of this year, our best seller, F-150, by the way, 100% built in the U.S. that our competitors can't say, grew almost 3x the rate of the overall pickup truck market. We expect our pricing and revenue to continue in the second half as we have new launches at Mustang. And I would add pace of new product introductions for Ford will only accelerate from here. We plan to introduce, for example, an all-new F-150 and F-150 PowerBoost hybrid at the Detroit Show in September.\nNow outside North America, the Ranger and its sister product, the Everest SUV, are the backbone of a much stronger, more profitable international business. The all-new version of the Ranger and Everest are most popular and profitable than the previous model, and Ranger alone is now the truck leader and eighth large pickup truck market around the globe. Our aftersales business continues to grow, and we are on track to launch over 2,000 mobile service units by the end of this year. That is unique to Ford.\nFord Blues, other top priorities are to follow reduce our cost structure. To do that, we've launched a lean, disciplined operating system that reaches into every one of our plants, every part we buy, every engineering decision we make. We're making progress, but this is just the start of our culture change.\nTurning to Pro, which is proving to be a unique strength to Ford. I mean what one of our competitors would get to have Ford Pro? It's a $50 billion commercial business with the potential to become a high-margin, high-multiple hardware, software and service company akin to John Deere. In the quarter, volume, pricing and software subscriptions continue to accelerate as we capture significant pent-up demand across multiple commercial sectors and locations in both North America and in Europe. We are now realizing the full benefits of our new Super Duty. Super Duty sales in Q2 were up 28%, and the strong demand for our flagship work product is going to fuel our earnings growth for years to come.\nAnd our brand business also continued to grow in the quarter. And that's before the launch of the all-new version of Ford Pro's other key profit pillar, the one Transit in Europe. Our share of the U.S. 127 commercial truck and van market is over 40% this year so far. That is twice our nearest competitor and brand, twice. And it's a similar story in Europe, where the Transit franchises help make Ford the top-selling commercial brand for 8 years in a row.\nFord Pro has all the attributes of the business that is difficult to disrupt. Our combination of services, software, dominant product, dominant market share, upfitting and large dealer physical repair work will not be easy to match. Accordingly, we will continue to shift more investment to fuel Ford Pro's growth and press our advantage with full flexibility between EV and ICE.\nSo now let's get to the big change in our industry. And it happens to start including with Ford Pro because Ford Pro is at the forefront of this biggest change, the digital transformation, going to software and services as a differentiator. We already have over or about 550,000 subscribers, paid subscribers and service subscribers, and Ford Pro is 80% of those. We are already seeing 50% gross margins on today's software services. For example, telematics, where customers are now paying $20 a month, and that's before we even introduced our fully-networked architecture in the new vehicles that launched just in the year or 2.\nMoving to the next profitable software segment. Since launch, BlueCruise customers have traveled nearly 1.4 billion hands-free hours across North America, and that is a 44% increase since the end of Q1, 44% increase in 3 months. In July, we hit our 100 millionth-mile driven, hands-free with BlueCruise. Our Version 1.0 was chosen by consumer reports earlier this year as the #1 rated system in the U.S. And since then, we've continued to enhance and accelerate launching 2 more versions of BlueCruise Cross through over their updates, each significantly improving the driver's experience. And we have now shortened the cycle time between these new versions.\nAs a company, we're investing significantly in software. But the bigger story is the elite talent we have brought into Ford. They are attracted by the opportunity to revolution, the experience of owning and driving a vehicle for millions of customers, driving an iconic brand like Ford. I really believe we have the industry's best minds working on this incredible digital revolution. And with that talent, we are moving from our supplier control firmware to our own fully-networked electric architecture. And this will reach across all vehicles: ICE, hybrids and EVs.\nThis is a key point because it allows us to have far higher installed base than just EVs alone. Think of the F-150. There are 3 key applications sit on top of this new software platform. The first one is safety and security. We haven't launched it yet. But boy, are we working hard to launch it. It will give customers ability to monitor the surroundings in their vehicle on top sites are at home. It will transform the experience of owning a Ford.\nThe second one, of course, is driver assist technology. BlueCruise is just the beginning of our ambition. And the third one is productivity. Like the telematics that we sell a pro, but we're not going to stop there. Right around the corner, we'll have predictive failure components. Now imagine our productivity gain for our Pro customers who never were off the road because we know something is going to go bad before it does. This is just the beginning of the applications. These services will bring high-margin, reoccurring revenue streams that are less capital-intensive and cyclical than our traditional vehicle sales.\nTo wrap up, there is understandably a lot of in the UAW contract discussions that began 2 weeks ago. We won't negotiate public, but I would like to share our general approach and our BlueCruise. When it comes to building in America and partnering with UAW, Ford from all the other automakers, most other major industrial companies. We believe, as Sean and Chuck do, the Ford should do our part to support the middle class, create vibrant communities and build a strong American and industrial [ pat ].\nEveryone knows or didn't go bankrupt, and we didn't take a bailout, but they may not know that we added a significant amount of UAW manufacturing jobs. In fact, thousands of jobs in the U.S. since The Great Recession. We have actually done more than is required by our contract to add jobs, move employees from temporary to permanent, improve benefits, and we're on our way to spending $1 billion to improve our factory working conditions. It comes with some additional costs. But for us, this is not simply a number-crunching exercise. We believe over time, customers will appreciate and reward our approach and our workforce to be more committed to delivering BlueCruise through our transformation. So although these negotiations promise to be challenging, our goal is to build a bridge to the future with our employees based on mutual trust and a spirit of problem solving with the UAW leadership, and of course, our incredible workforce.\nOver to you, John.\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim. On the power of our 3 customer-focused segments really starting this time through. In the quarter, we delivered an 8% increase in wholesale, adjusted EBIT of $3.8 billion and an 8.4% adjusted EBIT margin. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBIT was primarily driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher as we ramp EVs and expected lower core credit profits.\nIn the quarter, we delivered $2.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow, underscoring the improved performance generated from our industrial footprint. This consistency, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to target returning 40% to 50% of free cash flow to investors. And earlier this morning, we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $30 billion of cash and over $47 billion of liquidity. We're recently upgraded by both Moody's and DBRS and demonstrating the trajectory of the business.\nNow turning to our customer-focused business segments. With revenue growth of 5%, Ford Blue delivered $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of over 9%. Despite these strong results, EBIT declined modestly year-over-year, including the nonrecurrence of a onetime insurance settlement. That said, costs were flat, and we expect this to continue to improve in the second half of this year.\nNow importantly, Ford Blue continues to be profitable in every region, reflecting the disciplined capital allocation that has fundamentally derisked our global business. We're now really starting to see the results, a fresh, exciting product lineup that is driving both strong demand and price in key markets across the globe.\nAnd perhaps the strongest example of this is F-150, an incredible product, which many don't understand, effectively, our F-150 equivalent outside North America and that drives meaningful bottom line results for both blue and Mach-E.\nNow turning to Mach-E. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year and more than doubled significantly as we added capacity for both Manati and the F-150 lighting. Contribution margin and EBIT margin were both negative with pricing and volume pressures intensified, and that's impacting all OEs. Given the rapid and dynamic gain on the pricing environment, we no longer expect to see contribution margin breakeven for our Gen 1 products this year.\nOne of the primary benefits of Ford's industry-leading reporting transparency, product leadership and customer insight is that we can quickly react to market reality. We know that once a customer chooses an AV brand, they stick with that brand over time. So as we make pricing decisions and assess customer acquisition costs, we're not only weighing the immediate impact on profitability but also how this translates to the lifetime value of that customer.\nDespite the dynamic environment, we remain committed to delivering 8% EBIT margin target in 2026, and we have a real strategic benefit. Our second-generation products are being developed to complete with all new digital architecture. So while the path to sustainable profitability may not look quite the same as we previously thought, we're confident in our ability to deliver through a more efficient product design, cost efficiencies and growth in software and services, which will continue to accelerate.\nNow as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we will continue to be laser-focused on disciplined capital allocation and ultimately delivering a leading and profitable EV footprint that provides us with the flexibility to scale by based on customer demand.\nNow Ford Pro. Ford Pro's results, they continue to accelerate, demonstrating the power of our portfolio. For this quarter, Ford Pro delivered a 28% increase in revenue driven by transit in our all-new Super Duty. EBIT more than doubled to $2.4 million, resulting in a margin of 3%. The significant year-over-year improvement EBIT reflects higher pricing and increased volume, both outstanding of the strength in commercial business. And we continue to be encouraged by our leading market position in the U.S. and Europe, our strong order banks, the upcoming launch of our new one Transit and a huge opportunity to grow software and services, and I'll talk more about this in a moment. But with over 450,000 customer subscriptions and with significant growth each quarter, this is a key pillar of our Ford Pro business.\nFord Credit generated EBT of $309 million. Results were in line with our expectations, but down $550 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, nonrecurring credit loss reserve releases, residual value performance, all of which was already reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but is expected to increase and auction values remain robust, but are down from their peak in the first half of 2022.\nBefore turning to our outlook, let me provide a little more text regarding some. In my mind, this is the real opportunity for value. We are already seeing sustained double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all of our business segments and most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable change facility, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster.\nRegarding our outlook, we now expect full year total company adjusted EBIT of $11 billion to $12 billion, primarily reflecting stronger net pricing in Ford Pro and Ford Blue with adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion. Our guidance reflects headwinds, which include continued global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, higher industry-wide customer incentives and continued EV pricing pressure, increased warranty costs, lower past service exchange and costs associated with union agreements. And tailwinds include improvement in the supply chain and higher invite volume, all-new Super Duty and lower comps.\nNow turning to the segments. We now expect Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $8 billion. We expect higher volumes and stronger mix and more than offset any potential pricing headwind. The Model E to report an EBIT loss of around $4.5 billion, largely reflecting the present pricing environment, disciplined investment in new products and capacity and other costs. We also expect Ford Pro's EBIT to approach $8 billion with a significant year-over-year improvement driven by pricing and volume, including the benefit from the alley. And Ford Credit EBT is anticipated to be about $1.3 billion.\nSo that wraps our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of time to address what your minds. Thank you. And operator, please open the line for questions.",

My name is Gary, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director-Investor Relations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Gary, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer; and also for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.\nToday's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com.\nOur discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated, the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 25. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume-weighted.\nWant to make sure you've got a few near-term IR engagements on your calendars on May 21 and 22. We'll host our Capital Markets event in Dearborn, Michigan. For the first time in over 7 years, we're looking forward to welcoming representatives of the capital markets to our headquarters. The event will feature unprecedented experiences, including one of the largest displays of our global vehicle portfolio in recent memory and immersive presentations on the strategic plans of our 3 new customer-centered business segments. We will also feature details of our software and services strategy, both retail and commercial, as well as ample time to network with our senior leaders.\nOn May 25, Jim Farley will keynote at Morgan Stanley Sustainability Conference in New York City. And on May 31, Jim will participate in a fireside chat with Tony Saganaki at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, also in New York City.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nExecutive VP & President-Global Markets, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Lynn. And hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'd bottom line the first quarter like this. Our team delivered a solid quarter while making real progress on our Ford+ growth plan. And I hope that becomes a trend at Ford, boringly predictable when it comes to execution and delivering financials, but extremely ambitious and dynamic in creating the forward of the future.\nFor the quarter, we saw growth across all of our key metrics. In addition, Ford Pro and Blue were profitable in every region where we operate. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion in cash, even as we invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders.\nWith each quarter that passes, I'm more confident and commenced and thankful we made the decision to create 3 separate customer-focused businesses. This has unleased clarity, speed and accountability across the company, not to mention a whole new level of discipline on capital allocation. So let me cover a few highlights.\nI'd like to start with Ford Pro. I know many of you were surprised at the true size of the Pro business in March when we recast our financials. Pro starts with marketing leadership in our vehicles across the world, tremendous scale and customer knowledge. And we're layering on top of that the future of our industry, an ecosystem of software and services and EV charging that we believe will be invaluable to our commercial customers. And this will unlock tremendous loyalty and profitable growth. Our strong order books in North America and Europe as well as all the demand signals we can see for Pro support our target to nearly double Pro's EBIT this year.\nIn March, we launched the all-new Super Duty in Kentucky and Ohio. It has received tremendous reception, and it's going to strengthen a franchise that is already the market leader. Importantly, Super Duty is a platform for software and services that help our customers maximize their uptime, accelerate the productivity and lower total cost of ownership.\nI would also say the Super Duty launch is a good case study for the disciplined approach we're implementing across our industrial system. Simply put, we slowed the launch down significantly increased on road and implant quality testing. We dispatched a large and skilled launch team to our plant. We added test vehicles. We drove millions of miles to prove our durability, and we deployed new technology and artificial intelligence to cat issues. Basically, we put all the pressure in the system to find and then prevent future quality issues rather than speeding up the line to match our launch curve. Short-term patience, we believe that will result in long-term gain for our customers and yes, the company.\nIn the quarter, Ford Pro extended its leadership in true commercial vehicle categories. Our share of the Class 1 through 7 truck and vans in the U.S. increased by 1 full share point to 41% share. In Europe, we've already been the top commercial brand for 8 years now running, and our share grew to more than 15%. We also maintained our EV strength in North America and Europe. In the U.S., E-Transit has already a 50% market share. In the quarter, we won a contract to deliver more than 9,000 E-Transit vans to the U.S. Postal Service.\nFord Pro's paid software subscriptions rose 64% in the quarter. including higher revenue per unit software sales, like our telematics and charging software. With these and all the other initiatives, Ford Pro is developing into a resilient business, certainly less cyclical than the broader automotive sector.\nIn Ford Blue, the team is focused on capitalizing on our red-hot product lineup. Our opportunity to smartly grow extends to valuable franchises with great pricing power, like the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco and, of course, the Mustang. We'll grow our leadership position in pickups, in off-road, in performance and in SUVs with all new derivatives.\nFor example, we just introduced the Bronco less than 3 years ago. And already, it's neck and neck in sales with the Jeep Wrangler, and it has higher transaction prices. We've also recently expanded the Bronco lineup with exciting derivatives, like the Bronco Everglades, the Bronco Raptor and the Bronco Heritage.\nDerivaties not only continued to contribute to our growth but importantly, they can also drive higher transaction prices and higher returns. See, these derivatives often have 80% part commonality with the base models, but their contribution margin percents can be 30% higher with a twofold increase in capital efficiency. We also have one of the strongest product years coming for Ford Blue. So it's just beginning. We have the new Escape, including New Hybrid. It's just arriving in dealerships now. Next week, we will reveal the all-new Ranger in the highly anticipated Ranger Raptor. That will be followed by an all-new Mustang and high-performance Dark Horse Mustang this summer. While I can't get into the details yet, we have more exciting news to share about 2 of America's best-selling vehicles, the F-150 and the Explore later this year. And on top of all that, we have the Lincoln Corsair arriving at dealerships now. And of course, we just revealed the Lincoln Nautilus.\nNow Ford Model e operates with a start-up intensity to build a profitable EV business with a differentiated portfolio and a differentiated customer experience. U.S. investors now have true visibility into how Ford Model e's profitability strengthens over time supported by volume-driven operating leverage, improvements in design and efficiency and, of course, lower battery costs. We're on track this year towards a contribution margin approaching breakeven in Model e and for our first-generation products to be EBIT margin positive by the end of next year.\nWhole sales were down in the quarter, which deleveraged our cost structure. Part of the decline was planned as we have brought Mustang Mach-E production down for several weeks so we could almost double the capacity, and we are now hitting that 35 jobs per hour run rate in the plant. Volumes were also impacted by the lower output of F-150 Lightning. We did the right thing, and I congratulate my team many times by immediately stopping production and working with our battery supplier finding and then fixing the root cause of the fire that happened on the Ford property. We're now shipping Lightnings, again, taking new orders and increasing production to an annual run rate of 150,000 units, about double what we do now.\nWe are also revealing -- we revealed an all-electric Explorer in Europe, which is now very well received. We made progress on Model e in the quarter, advancing our industrial system to scale EVs. The site preparation is already underway for our LFP battery plant in Michigan. And construction continues at the Blue Oval SK Battery Park in Kentucky and, of course, Blouiville City in Tennessee. We now plan to transform our Oakville assembly complex into a Canadian hub of electric vehicle and battery pack manufacturing. We also continue to make progress towards locking in all the raw materials that we need to support our capacity targets in 2016 and beyond.\nModel e is our center of excellence for technology, including software. A good example of that is BlueCruise, which continues to be hit with our customers. Consumer Reports rated at the top advanced, hands-free driver assist system on the market in the U.S, and that was just version 1.0. Our latest release, which we're OTA-ing into customers, is version 1.2. It automatically changes lanes with the tap of a turn signal, and it delivers a much more natural driving experience hands-free.\nWe also launched Blue Cruise in the U.K., our Mustang Mach-E, and became the first OEM to gain approval for hands-free highway driving speed anywhere in Europe with more than -- and now BlueCruise has more than 70 million miles driven to date, and we continue to upgrade BlueCruise for customers with each over their update.\nBefore I turn it over to John, I want to share our thoughts on how the EV market is evolving in our eyes. It's easy to look at the landscape of the EV market as a mono lift. But we plan to be surgical about where we play and how we win with the right products, the right cost structure and the right price points. We do not subscribe to a win vehicle share at any cost approach. We look at share of vehicles, of course, and share revenue. We also look at share profits and share of the customer lifetime value, and we believe this is the only way to ensure we drive appropriate return on capital over time.\nBy 2025, we now expect there to be 45 EV models to be offered in the U.S. in the small, medium utility segment. It will be a very saturated 2-row EV market. Against this backdrop to ensure profitable growth, we know we have to have a fresh, compelling offering with the right cost structure, something we continue to improve with the Mustang Mach-E.\nWe also found that customers are very loyal to full EV powertrains once they enter, but they are not brand-loyal for their first purchase. We capitalize on that by getting to the market early with the Mustang Mach-E and our whole lineup, and it continues to reward us with over 60% of the customers new to Ford. We're seeing that the second EV purchase is much more loyal to the brand in these developed EV markets. So we're glad that we have all these customers in our digital and physical ecosystem. We are aggressively lowering our product costs for our current and next-generation products. You'll find out a lot more in Capital Markets Day. But in fact, for Mustang Mach-E from launch through the end of this year, we'll have reduced the bill of materials from Mustang Mach-E by $5,000 per vehicle.\nNow in contrast to 2-world crossovers that we believe will be a very saturated market, we believe Model e can be highly differentiated in markets where we know the customer well, like the 3-row utility space. And as I said, we'll share more about at our Capital Markets event later this month on our product strategy.\nI had a chance, along with John and most of our leadership team, to go to China in the last few weeks and look at the EV market in a [ gemba ], go-and-see activity up close. It's interesting to see how customers are no longer just attracted to traditional luxury brands with EVs or even hardware design anymore. Outstanding hardware styling, performance, quality are just a given in the EV digital marketplace today. The best new brands are offering integrated digital, retail, lifestyle and experience that are software defined. This is firmly in our sights for our second-generation EVs.\nThis software as a differentiator, plus a radically different cost structure and the ability to attract -- attach value-added software and services, gives us confidence we can compete and win in unit, revenue, profit and vehicle share while delivering appropriate returns. And Ford Pro is already there.\nI'll wrap up by saying we are pleased, but we are not satisfied. As I said, solid execution and some really thrilling progress advancing our Ford+ plan. I look forward to seeing many of you in person in 3 weeks for our capital markets event, where we will go much deeper into our strategy and our progress. John?\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nCFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim. First quarter, wholesales were up 9% year-over-year as we delivered $3.4 billion in adjusted EBIT. Margin was 8.1%, up 140 basis points. Ford Blue and Ford Pro profit improved, reflecting favorable mix and higher net pricing. And as expected, those benefits were partially offset with a loss in Model e as we invest in our clean sheet next-generation EVs and scale our leading portfolio of first-generation electric vehicles.\nFor the quarter, we delivered $700 million of adjusted free cash flow. Improving consistent free cash flow from our industrial footprint, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides us with significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion of cash and over $46 billion of liquidity. In addition, despite the recent market volatility, we successfully completed the renewal of our $17 billion sustainability-linked corporate credit facilities.\nSo turning to our customer-focused business segments. With wholesales up 6%, Ford Blue delivered $2.6 billion in EBIT and a 10.4% margin. That was 400 basis points higher than a year ago supported by favorable mix and higher volume. Our fresh and exciting product lineup continues to drive strong demand. Wholesales for Model e declined in the quarter, reflecting planned downtime that allowed us to almost double our production capacity for Mustang Mach-E.\nNow the profitability of any EV start-up, including Ford Model e, is highly levered to volume. Importantly, holding volume constant, our first quarter EBIT margin would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter at around negative 40%. We expect Ford Model e EBIT margin to improve to around negative 20% in the second half of this year reflecting stronger per unit contribution margin and significantly higher volumes. In fact, we expect Model e contribution margin to approach breakeven this year, and we continue to target positive EBIT margin for our first-generation vehicles by the end of 2024.\nFord Pro delivered an 18% increase in wholesales. And EBIT improved $900 million to $1.4 billion for the quarter, delivering a margin of 10.3%. The improvement in profitability was supported by higher net pricing, increased volume and favorable mix. Importantly, this was achieved during a quarter when wholesales for Super Duty were down, both year-over-year and sequentially as we ramped up production of our all-new version of this highly popular truck.\nFord Credit delivered EBT of $300 million, down $600 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, higher credit losses and lower lease income, all of which has been reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and is still below the historical average but beginning to normalize. Auction values remain robust, but down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Ford Credit liquidity remained strong at $26 billion, up $5 billion from year-end. In addition, despite the volatile market conditions, the company has already completed $12 billion of public issuance or roughly 50% of its 2023 funding plan.\nTurning to our outlook. We continue to expect full year 2023 total company adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion, adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion to $9 billion. This guidance includes headwinds that reflect global economic uncertainty, higher industry-wide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalance, lower past service pension income, exchange and investments in growth such as customer service and connected services. And tailwinds driven by improvement in the supply chain, our higher industry volume with SAARs of about $15 million and $13 million in the U.S. and Europe, respectively, launch of our all-new Super Duty and lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities.\nTurning to the segments. Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $7 billion cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise through the year, along with adverse exchange. Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around $3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investment in new products and capacity. We also anticipate Ford Pro's EBIT to nearly double to around $6 billion compared to our 2022 results. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. And EBT for Ford Credit is anticipated to be around $1.3 billion.\nAdditionally, I hope that all of you are blocking time for our next capital markets event on May 21 and 22 here in Dearborn. This will be an important couple of days as we update you on Fords strategy, take a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our customer-centered business segments and talk about our capabilities and expectations for software and services. By the time we're done, I believe you will even be better equipped to value the expected contributions of each of the segments to Ford's overall growth and return.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Jason, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.\nToday's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck, along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content, at shareholder.ford.com.\nToday's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 24. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume-weighted.\nI want to call out a few near-term key IR engagements. On February 15, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Rod Lash at the Wolfe Global Auto, Auto Tech and Mobility Conference. On March 23, at the New York Stock Exchange, we will hold a teach in about our new Ford+ segment reporting. This event, featuring John Lawler and Cathy O'Callaghan, our Controller, will be webcast. And I'm also pleased to share that our next Capital Markets Day will be Monday, May 22, at our headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Please save the date. We'll have more information about this over the coming weeks.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Lynn, and hi, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. I'll start by addressing the obvious.\nOur fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential. And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts. And to say I'm frustrated is an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford.\nNow I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question. So let me share my perspective.\nWith Ford+ plan, we are executing a double transformation. While we're making progress, it's hard work. As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer.\nNow the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system, product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality. This is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do. It funds our future, that second transformation, which we're aggressively building today. Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and, of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high-growth, high-margin, not just products but software and services business.\nNow the second transformation, the growth part, is going better than I imagined. At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be #2 in EV sales in the U.S. I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out. And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market, or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts. And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market.\nBottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+. And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough.\nNow this is what we should be known for. It's our legacy, and we'll show we can do it again. We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out. Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time. It's not an excuse, but it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently.\nOver the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to re-energize and rebuild a leading industrial organization. We've committed company-wide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company.\nAnd we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day. This has been humbling for both me and our team. That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan. I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford.\nNow I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone. Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow. We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline. And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win. These strengths will shine through.\nUltimately, the proof will be in our results. That's exactly how it should be. We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders.\nSo with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus. First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. And you saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo. And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits. This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward.\nOur balance sheet liquidity remains strong, and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly. And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software while, importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders. And we now have created 3 distinct customer-facing business segments: Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely.\nSo let me cover a couple of highlights. I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford. Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford. In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor. And in Europe, Ford has been the #1 vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for 8 years in a row.\nLet me bring this point home. Here in North America home market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business. It owns half the emergency response business and half the utility business. And the requirements for all these customers are complex. They're not going to commoditize, and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership. And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity.\nNow we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today. E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van, with 73% market share. 60% of all of our U.S. fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next 2 years to their fleet. And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries.\nThis year, Pro really gets going. We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup. And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-Tonne Transit. And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging. Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now.\nWe're also increasing our sales of parts and services via a network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which open 24/7. In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro. And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business.\nNow moving to Blue. The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry. We know that, typically, the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power. So our decision to move away from sedans and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off. Ford gained nearly 1 point of market share here in the U.S. last year, and we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth.\nFord Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future, with strong profits and robust free cash flow. And F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks. We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year.\nIn addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material. And in quality, we have work to do. Ford has been the #1 in recalls in the U.S. for the last 2 years. Clearly, that's not acceptable. We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system. And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America.\nAnd Model e. It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love. In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford. The F-150 Lightning has been America's best-selling electric pickup since it launched. And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers.\nWe remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000. So 50,000 is a big growth. And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026.\nNow to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, throughout facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out new battery capacity and assembly capacity. Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval City and our 3 BlueOval SK battery plants. And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey.\nNow critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel. We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year. Now we are deep in the development of our second-generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome.\nThese EVs will be fully software-updatable. That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified. Imagine 3 body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations. That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products. And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill of material and lower manufacturing cost.\nWhen we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model e EBIT target of 8%. We're already making the customer-buying experience better with less friction. Now this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year. This program has been adopted by nearly 2/3 of our 3,000 U.S. dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience.\nNext January, we'll be selling EVs in high volume with virtually no inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences. We're also expanding BlueOval charging network at all of our dealers. And we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs.\nNow I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry. I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver-assist, hands-free technology, was just tested by Consumer Reports and judged the best hands-free autonomous system on the market. Let that sink in for a while. The best on the market. Now have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our 2 major competitors.\nAnd at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles. So we're scaling incredibly rapidly. That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year. And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems.\nNow before I hand it over to John, just a few things. Ford is a different company today. We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generate sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital. While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity.\nThis year is about execution. It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running. John?\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nInterim Chief Global Supply Chain Officer, VP & CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim. As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be. The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition. We've all done it, we're much higher.\nAnd this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement. And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made upon our geographic footprint and product portfolio. Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns. And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency.\nNow on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers. Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital.\nSo turning to the year. We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%. And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business. And this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which, until recently, was a significant source of cash burn.\nNow our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity. This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders. In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete. Going forward, we intend to target distributions of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return.\nNow for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%. And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 billion more in adjusted EBIT. For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower-than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges.\nNow let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed, recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the Automotive segments with regional breakouts. Now North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases. EBIT margin was 8.4%. We continue to maintain a healthy order bank. And the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products.\nIn South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable. In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year. But as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target. Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital.\nOur core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business. In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs. Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing, sustainable and delivering appropriate returns. Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the all-new Ranger and our decision to exit India. And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability.\nAnd finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates. Now given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023.\nFor the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAAR of 15 million units in the U.S. and 13 million units in Europe. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion. Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year.\nAnd for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S. and a moderate recession in Europe; higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance; Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative gains.\nWe expect a continued strong dollar. We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income. And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and CapEx as we build out our growth plan. Now tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform.\nNow before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day. On March 23, we'll hold a teach in at the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segment will alter our financial reporting. The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment.\nAt the teach in, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person. But we will also broadcast a webcast live and we'll be -- and we'll post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models. Now the teach in will not be a strategic update. That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy. We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments as well as for software and services.\nNow with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile.\nAnd as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford. We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors. And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders.\nNow that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. So thank you. And operator, please open up the line for questions.",

My name is Gary, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; and Doug Field, Chief Advanced Product Development and Technology Officer for Ford Model e.\nToday's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com.\nToday's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 23.\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted.\nLooking at our IR calendar, we have 2 upcoming engagements. Tomorrow, Bank of America will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Lisa Drake, our VP of EV Industrialization and Manufacturing Engineering for Ford Model e. And on November 7, tech analyst, Tony Sacconaghi, will host a fireside chat with Doug Field at the AllianceBernstein's Electric Revolution Conference in London.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone. We really appreciate you being with us today. We introduced the Ford+ plan for growth and value creation 2 years ago, and the investment thesis have 3 drivers: leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services as well as mobility. So today, I'd like to share a progress report on Ford's transformation, of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement and, of course, recap the quarter.\nOur ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape. In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of 3 products. They're now in scaling F-150 Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit. And each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers. So this is growth. We're now the #2 electric brand in the U.S., and we're just beginning with our scaling.\nOur decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford. We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love but have lined up to buy. And we have so many more exciting products to come.\nWe have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups like India. And our results and cash flow you could see in our results have improved dramatically. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification.\nAnd what is perhaps the biggest untold story at Ford, we've successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world's best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future. At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead. Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management.\nAnd our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we'd like it to be. I can't overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas. I look forward to updating you on future calls.\nNow I'd like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy. 5 years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology. In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels. We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people.\nWe've learned though in our partnership with Argo and after our own internal investments that we will have a very long road. It's estimated that more than $100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy, and yet no one has defined a profitable business model at scale. Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we've decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment. We're working closely with Argo and VW on all the details.\nBut here's what I want to focus on. Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives, time. This has become mission-critical for us at Ford. Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue Zone miles. We have strong technology partners working alongside us. And now we're going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who've done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space, but their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system.\nYes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3. But at the end of the day, this is about giving names of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic.\nAnd as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don't expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to. Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas: reliable and low-cost sensing, it's not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments.\nThe muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative BlueCruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life. What's so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford. We will introduce a lineup of not first but second cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin, an amazing array of software-enabled services not just BlueCruise L3 but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security. And we're already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers. That is a transformation for us.\nLet me now switch to the quarter. With Ford Model e, we're on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026. I'll say that carefully. There is no change to our target. We're adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightnings as we speak, and we're scaling production of E-Transit. In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete and turning out vehicles midway through next year.\nOur Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the 2-tonne E-Transit, but they're also going to be launching a brand-new product, a 1-tonne E-Transit Custom electric while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits. And in September, we're starting production -- we've already started construction of BlueOval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new-generation EV truck and batteries. And at the same time, we've already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky. We're also further strengthening Model e's EV supply chain. Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly, the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need.\nWe expect the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford. What's not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth. So let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA.\nThe first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour. From '23 to '26, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in '27 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production.\nThe second benefit is often overlooked. I haven't actually read any one of the media covering this, but it's super important for Ford. And that's the commercial EV credit. You know that Ford is the #1 commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing. Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify.\nThe third opportunity is retail. Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year. Next year, we believe we'll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models. In '24, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit. So we believe it's a playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S. and FTA develops.\nThe fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments such as geothermal energy credit critical for BlueOval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components. We're exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine.\nNow as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas. That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, non-negotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships. Now early response from the dealers have been very favorable. Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize for Blue or for Pro. And there's real rewards for going first.\nTurning to Ford Blue. We view this business Ford Blue is growth. Last month, we unveiled the seventh generation Mustang. We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky. And there are -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology, upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains, and they really set them apart from the competition.\nWhat you can't see is what we see. Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we're a leader among the leaders. And I can't wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains.\nFinally, let's talk about Pro. In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans. In Europe, we're also the #1 commercial vehicle brand. That's for 7 years now, soon to be 8. Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro's vehicles as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity. Now that includes multi-make fleets and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs. Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service. We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year, and they're driving significant dealer parts and service revenue. Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month.\nBut the real game changer for us in the Pro business, in parts and service growth, is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security and predictive failure of all components. In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter. Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro Fleet and the VIIZR field service management software.\nBut before I hand it over to John, let me end with this. We have many challenges as a company, and we're tackling them head-on. That's clear from our third quarter results. At the same time, I'm so excited about the future we're creating with Ford+. We're building completely new businesses with the best Ford talent and incredibly -- incredible new talent across not just Model e but Ford Blue and Ford Pro. We're strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we've ever had. And we're tracking to scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we're investing in growth.\nTaken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world's most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era. There's no holding back. There's no looking back. There's no slowing down. In fact, we're accelerating our transformation. John?\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nInterim Chief Global Supply Chain Officer, VP & CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim. So when I look at the quarter and our performance year-to-date, I'm actually seeing some real positives.\nFirst, our strategic actions to segment and stand up 3 distinct business, Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, while not complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business. So it's about more than just accelerating profitable growth. It's also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers. The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and ultimately cost and efficiency. And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing and how we interact with each other and our suppliers. And so to me, this is really exciting. We understand the magnitude of opportunity and the leverage that this will provide across the entire business. Now we just need to deliver.\nSecond, our product portfolio has never been stronger, starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor. These are all inspiring products that our customers love.\nAnd finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off. Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our Automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity. And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America.\nSo with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month. In Automotive, wholesales were up 7% year-over-year. However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump-sum supplier settlements.\nThe settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners. So providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain. So we're very grateful for our suppliers' ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us.\nIn the quarter, we delivered $3.6 billion in free cash flow with strong cash generation by our Automotive business despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels. We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers.\nOur balance sheet continues to be very healthy. And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $32 billion and $49 billion, respectively. And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter.\nNow I'll touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%. Both of those measures were driven down year-over-year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures and a diverse mix reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory. Our brand strength in order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North America margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter.\nSouth America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter.\nIn Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million. And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%. Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position, ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year-to-date.\nAnd in China, we posted a loss of $200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially.\nOur International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable. EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger.\nAnd then finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business. The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the nonoperating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs.\nLet me now walk through our impairment of Argo. As Jim highlighted, it's become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of full autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected. L2+ and L3 driver-assist technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably, and that's going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams. During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+/L3 technology. And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a $2.7 billion noncash pretax impairment as a special item.\nNow let me share with you our current outlook. For the year, we expect to earn about $11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021, with about a 10% increase in wholesale. We're now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion.\nOur year-over-year basis for our '22 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion with strong though lower auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford's newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about $9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar.\nSo finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting. So we've now fixed the date for March.\nAt the teach-in, we will share both 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023. But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we'll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings. And we'll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. And thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

My name is Chad, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Chad. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.\nToday's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck, along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content, at shareholder.ford.com.\nToday's discussions also include forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 22. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted.\nLooking at our IR calendar, we have 2 upcoming engagements. Tomorrow, BNP Paribas will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Kumar Galhotra, President of Ford Blue; and on August 10, at their Auto Conference in New York, JPMorgan will host a fireside chat with Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. The Ford team delivered a very solid second quarter in a challenging environment where we saw supply chain disruptions, a lot of new economic headwinds and uncertainty as a whole. Importantly, we achieved these results as we advance the Ford+ plan, which is the biggest opportunity to create value at Ford since we scaled the Model T. And at the core of Ford+ are 3 fundamental promises to our customers: distinctive and breakthrough products and experiences; and always on relationship with Ford every day, every hour, every minute; and ever-improving post-purchase user experiences powered by software.\nToday, I'll give you an update on Ford+ and the early results of our decisions to reorganize the company into 3 distinct segments: Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro.\nNow let me start with the progress we're making to lead the electric vehicle and digital revolution. What's lost in the industry's arm race of claims regarding capital invested, the number of top hats we all have, the promises of future leadership is one fundamental question: who is and will be the best position to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question.\nNow we've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first-generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and the E-Transit. These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks. We're selling them as fast as we can make them.\nAnd you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now. We believe that these great new products will enable us to grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market, combined with our healthy and vibrant shares of our ICE and growing hybrid markets.\nThis month, we expect to produce 14,000 EVs globally. That's significantly higher than just a few months ago, and we have a clear path to reach a run rate of 60,000 EVs by the end of next year. And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026. In fact, our anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what we expect for the global EV industry in total.\nNow securing the raw materials to produce batteries at scale is critical to our plan. It's estimated that, at best, 50% of all raw materials required to meet the combined announced targets for all EV OEMs is actually available, 50%. And this is why speed to securing supply is so critical and strategic, so is diversifying our battery chemistries to increase our flexibility, supply and profit and to support different customer use cases.\nLast week, we announced a series of MOUs and agreements to fulfill our ambition -- ambitious needs that I covered, and we are working to complete definitive agreements where necessary. Our Model e team moved quickly to capture these opportunities. To summarize, we've added battery chemistries and secure contracts, delivering 60 gigawatt hours of annual battery capacity, which will help us support fully the 600,000 units of that 2023 run rate of capacity.\nWe now have lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery packs coming for the Mach-E sold in North America next year and for Lightning in early 2024, creating more capacity for these high-demand products. We secured 70% of the battery capacity needed to support 2 million units by the end of 2026, and we struck a new deal with CATL on strategic cooperation for global battery supplies as well as deals for direct sourcing of critical battery raw materials in the U.S., Australia, Indonesia and more locations. And we have a plan to localize 40-gigawatt hours per year LFP capacity in North America by 2026. These deals are a strong start as we fortify our EV supply chain that's aligned with our sustainability and human rights principles.\nNow let's talk about the progress we're making in building out and always on relationship with customers and that ever-improving user experience enabled by software after the customer buys a vehicle. Now along with product execution, these are really the relevant sustainable advantages we see to create, in today's hypercompetitive market, a difference where the real competition is not legacy OEMs, but pure-play EV companies, including emerging Chinese players.\nFor example, more than 55,000 Ford customers have already driven nearly 10 million miles with BlueCruise, our hands-free L2 system. That's just 1 year after the capacity was launched, and we started OTA-ing this to our vehicles. We're using the data we get through BlueCruise to continue to improve the customer experience. And as it happens, you can imagine a significant ADAS revenue and profit stream being created by giving customers the ability to work, watch a film or even take a nap during a long trip in their Ford. While the financial benefits of ADAS are clear, as is our Ford Pro services stack, they're relatively small now, but we're rapidly increasing the number of digital vehicles on the road as well as attach rates of the enabling services. And over time, much of the SaaS revenue will be deferred on our balance sheet, providing an annuity-like revenue stream that is highly accretive, something this company and this industry has never seen.\nNow before I turn to Ford Blue, let me talk briefly about our connected EV dealer model in the U.S. Changes in the market have compelled Ford and our dealers to revisit how customers shop, buy and own, and how they will do this going forward. We're moving fast as the transition to these digital EV platforms allows us to help our dealers provide better customer ownership experience post purchase, and in turn, enables them to expand the revenue and profit pools, expanding and improving their returns. We're working with our dealers to create a retail model better than what's offered by any traditional OEM and better than the startups who are now scrambling to develop sales and service networks to support customers in an attempt to sustain and grow share in UIO.\nIn the U.S. alone, if we can help our dealers increase service loyalty by just 20 points, that's $2.4 billion incremental revenue for them every year. Now since March, we've conducted more than 30 workshops in the U.S. and Canada, reaching hundreds of our dealers. I have personally been involved in many of these meetings. What is clear to me but not yet visible to the market is that our dealers are embracing this change. They know the competitive threat is real, and they want Ford and their dealership to lead and win. And we have more to share as this develops.\nNow turning to Ford Blue. The team is motivated by this sharpening focus on our ICE and hybrid products. We've added new talent and leadership to drive performance and focus in our trucks, our great family lineup and our enthusiast vehicles we're so proud of. We've revealed new vehicles like the Bronco Raptor, the Bronco Everglades, the F-150 Raptor R, which my kids think sounds great. In the third quarter, we'll unveil an all-new seventh generation Mustang at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit. It is a stunning car, and I'm so excited to share it with the world. And also this fall, we'll be introducing an all-new Super Duty pickup, the workhorse at Ford, and it sets a standard in our industry.\nThere's much more to come. Our design center is filled with new products and derivatives that will further strengthen our hit vehicles in the ICE and hybrid franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Maverick, the brand-new global Ranger that's launching in Thailand, and our new Everest. In short, our hottest and freshest lineup in recent history is getting even better.\nNow in commercial vehicle market, Ford Pro, our industry-leading global business, is leading the change into an electric software-driven world. Other OEMs are talking about large numbers of future electric orders. We're actually taking orders for manufacturing and selling commercial vehicles now.\nThrough the second quarter, we've sold more than 3,000 E-Transit in the U.S. That's a market share of 95% in the full-sized electric van market, 95%. In fact, our next 2 competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.\nBeyond the vehicles, we're also rolling out our Ford Pro charging commercial solutions and the very exciting and fast-growing e-telematics software solutions. And boy, are they paying off.\nAnd in Europe, where we continue to be the leading commercial vehicle brand, we already received 8,000 orders for our 2-tonne E-Transit, and our new 1-tonne E-Transit Custom goes on sale next year.\nNow our Ford Pro software business is growing quickly. Paid telematics subscriptions globally have grown over 40% sequentially for the last 2 quarters.\nTurning to quality. We made solid progress in initial quality, as you've seen in the recent J.D. Power's IQS study, and our launches have improved. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Yes, this affects our cost, but more importantly, it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers. Quality is our #1 priority. In fact, we recently brought on Josh Halliburton from J.D. Power to head quality. Now the team is focused on 3 critical areas: prevention, detection and remediation.\nWe've instituted more robust engineering sign-off processes for the vehicles that are in the product development factory as we speak. We're driving much more frequent alignment with our supply base on quality. And when identified issues, we take actions quickly to resolve them, to protect our customer's experience, including by making much more frequent use of over-the-air updates. And boy, has that worked for us. We have more work to do in this space, and we will keep you updated.\nOverall, we're pleased with the progress this year, but we are not nearly satisfied. We remain clear-eyed and determined to move with speed and determination on a Ford+ transformation. The underlying strength of our business supports our 2022 adjusted EBIT guidance range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, unchanged from April.\nBefore I turn it over to John, I want to end with this. There's context that's critical to how we think about implementing our Ford+ plan. Traditionally, the auto industry has cut costs, often indiscriminately. As an effect, of course, from lower auto demands through economic softness and shift for customer preferences.\nWhat we're undertaking forward is totally different than that. We're reshaping virtually every aspect of the way we've done business for a century. And we're doing that for a new industry based on new technology, new skills and a new promise for customer value. And yet, cost reduction will happen in our ICE business because that's primarily what is made up of Ford today. But we're modernizing to take out unnecessary costs, redesigning work and strategically investing across all of our auto businesses, ICE and hybrid, then EVs and then Ford Pro, while at the same time, transforming every function that supports them.\nSweeping strategic change generates interest and speculation in the media, which we understand. However, we're going to comment on Ford+ actions we're taking and how they're going to strengthen our company on our own schedule. John?\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nVP & CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Jim. During the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion, an EBIT margin of 9.3% and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. Our cash conversion in the quarter was very strong and lifting our first half to 50%, with the target range of 50% to 60% that we set out at Capital Markets Day.\nWe ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively. And now these numbers include our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $2 billion at the end of the quarter. In Q2, we also successfully renewed our $17.2 billion sustainability-linked global credit facilities, which include a new $1.75 billion 364-day revolver, which provides for additional working capital flexibility. Our strong balance sheet is a solid foundation for continuing to invest in our Ford+ priorities.\nOur results this quarter reflect the improved earnings and cash flow potential of our business, along with leverage created from disciplined capital allocation and a much more focused business model, including our industrial footprint. The tough choices we made during the global redesign to de-risk our business and exit unprofitable markets and products is paying off.\nFrom 2018 to 2021, our markets outside North America consumed nearly $9 billion of free cash flow. This year, these markets are collectively expected to be free cash flow positive.\nWe are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to fund all the calls of capital -- all the calls that we have on capital, especially those fundamental to growth and value creation. We can achieve this while maintaining the financial flexibility to navigate external uncertainties. And as a result, we're increasing our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 a share beginning this quarter. This returns us to the prepandemic dividend levels.\nNow let me touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $3.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 11.3%. Both of those measures were up year-over-year as an 89% increase in wholesales and strong net pricing and mix more than offset higher commodity costs and inflationary pressures.\nSouth America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a modest profit as a large increase in wholesales helped us reach just above breakeven EBIT. The underlying trajectory of the region continues to improve. However, the adverse effects of the near-term supply chain disruption are dampening its overall results. In China, we posted a loss as the local economy and auto industry were significantly disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions and lockdowns. Now Lincoln continues to be a profit pillar for the region, gaining share in the quarter, along with commercial vehicles.\nOur International Markets Group continues to be sustainably profitable as a result of its restructuring efforts. In Mobility, we are progressing our in-market pilots for moving goods and moving people and remain committed to autonomous driving. And finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.\nNow let me share with you our current thinking for the remainder of 2022. For the full year, our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021. This reflects 10% to 15% year-over-year growth in wholesales and assumes that semiconductor availability continues to improve.\n[In addition], we're projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, with a significant portion of that coming from automotive operations. Relative to adjusted EBIT on a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America, collective profitability in the rest of the world, strong but lower Ford Credit EBT, they'll be in the $3 billion range, and modest improvements in Mobility and Corporate Other.\nOther key assumptions include strong order banks and pent-up demand for our new and iconic products, continued strength in pricing, which includes the benefits of pricing actions taken during the year, commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset with improvements in net pricing and mix, a continuation of other broad-based inflationary pressures, and we now expect the full effect to be about $3 billion, which is up $1 billion from our estimate last quarter. And of course, we're aggressively working on offsets to these increases.\nAnd finally, at Ford Credit, auction values will remain strong but decline in the second half as the supply of new vehicles improve. EBT will be strong but lower, reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Our results in the quarter, full year outlook and commitment to medium-term targets together demonstrate the power of Ford+ as we invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.\nBut before we turn it to Q&A, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. As we shared in March, starting in the first quarter of 2023, we will have 3 new business segments: Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, and will no longer report a combined automotive segment. With Ford Next, which is formerly Mobility, and Ford Credit, this will bring our total reportable operating segments to 5. Now this change will not be a simple pro forma exercise. It's much more fundamental. These are true segments with both operating and financial accountability, giving you added transparency on our business.\nSo to help you prepare for this change, we plan to hold a teach-in early next year prior to releasing our 2022 results. We will use our revised 2021 results as a template to reflect the new segments. As part of the teach-in, we also plan to cover business rationale, mechanics of the new reporting structure and how our earnings disclosure and our SEC filings will change. When we report our fourth quarter and our full year results for 2022, they will be based on our existing reportable segments, and we are targeting to also share at the same time 2022 results that are revised to reflect the new segments. And so if you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out to Lynn and the rest of the IR team.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open it up for questions.",

My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLynn Antipas Tyson\n\nExecutive Director of IR, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Andrea. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; Hau Thai-Tang, Chief Industrial Platform Officer; and Doug Field, Chief EV and Digital Systems Officer for the Model e.\nToday's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck, along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content, at shareholder.ford.com.\nToday's discussions also include forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 28. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ford Motor Company\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you, Lynn, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Yesterday, I was with Bill Ford and our incredible team at the Rouge factory, where my grandfather worked, to celebrate job 1 for the F-150 Lightning. We were all so proud as a team for delivering a truly breakthrough electric truck and delivering it on time as a launch.\nThe excitement around the truck is like nothing I've ever seen in my career. In fact, the power went out in the facility, and we ran most of the presentation with F-150 Pro power on board. While we have work ahead to fully scale production and fill an extraordinary order bank, both for our retail Lightning customers and Ford Pro, make no mistake, this is a very important moment for us at Ford.\nWe're accelerating our significant transformation. We have the right plan called Ford+. We are putting in place the right organization. As you know, on March 2, we announced our plan to form 2 distinct but interdependent business units called Ford Model e and Ford Blue. Together with Ford Pro, these 3 automotive businesses allow us to clearly define and assign priorities, make the most of our existing strengths, but also build new strategic muscles and, most importantly, capabilities.\nFord Model e is responsible for delivering clean sheet breakthrough EV designs, software advanced electric architectures, partial autonomy. And Ford Blue's mission is to deliver a more vibrant and profitable ICE business, a business that's going to serve in the short term as our profit and cash engine for the entire enterprise.\nSo what have we learned since March 2? And what are we working on at Ford? In terms of Model e, first, it's very clear to us that battery capacity is the key unlock to our EV aspirations and propel our growth in the future. We're in good shape in the near term. In the medium and long term, securing raw materials, processing, precursor and refinement and setting up battery production here in the U.S. and around the world is a big work statement for us. Expect a lot of news from Ford in the future related to the vertical integration of our EV business.\nSecond, we're getting after our talent gap in key areas, EV engineering, software and autonomous driving technology. We have a very good start already, and we will continually be very aggressive on recruiting talent.\nThird, we're now deep into discussions with our dealer partners around the globe, but especially in North America, on brand new standards that are required to launch a completely different customer experience that is leaner and better for our customers that we believe will not only be competitive but superior to a solely direct model. We're drafting standards as we speak and plan to roll this out this year.\nFinally, we're crafting our EV future product pipeline and are focused on a small number of highly compelling, highly volume models in key segments where we already lead. I want to make this very clear, some companies seem to be pursuing a strategy of trying to match model-wise volume with 8 or 9 top hats. That's not a winning plan in our view. We will focus on key volume nameplates, constrained capital because we have it, but really to leverage scale and efficiency to reach and eventually exceed our 8% EBIT target for EVs.\nI want to be clear here that as we move forward, our EV designs will be progressive, and they're going to be aimed at bringing new customers to Ford and Lincoln. They will not be electric versions of our existing lineup.\nNow in terms of Ford Blue, we will accelerate our restructuring and address our uncompetitive cost structure. We're going to attack complexity in areas such as powertrain. We can't wait. This work starts now. We will continue to invest in our ICE business but in targeted ways to build our most popular and profitable vehicle lines, F-Series, Bronco, Super Duty and a few others.\nAnother focus is quality. We made good progress on initial quality and launches. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. This has to change. We must do more to aggressively address our engineering process and improve our robustness.\nNow our Ford Pro business is on track. We see healthy growth in parts sales, mechanic repairs, growth in subscriptions for both charging and telematics, and CV financing. Most importantly, we're making our customers' lives and businesses better. They're using data. They're improving their uptime and their bottom line.\nSupply chain constraints continue to impact our business, including some of our key profit pillars. That said, we're making progress on launching and scaling new products as you can see with Lightning. That said, our major focus now is accelerating a more fundamental change in our supply chain management to improve visibility through our entire value chain and secure supply, especially in places like Semis and batteries.\nWe're absolutely committed to unlocking value by improving our growth profile, our profitability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our automotive-related businesses. Our new targets include producing more than 2 million EVs in 4 short years by the end of 2026. That's about 70-plus CAGR. And we expect that by 2030, EVs will account for about 50% of our global sales.\nWe have also reset our profit ambition. We are now targeting 10% company-adjusted EBIT margins by 2026.\nNow in terms of the first quarter, I would describe our performance as mixed. The appeal of our new products is really clear, and customers demand is extremely strong beyond the supply constraint of our industry. However, we are still grappling with persistent supply chain issues that prevent us from posting even stronger quarter. We're working to break constraints whenever they exist to take full advantage of this incredibly hot product lineup. Both new EVs like the F-150 Lightning but our iconic ICE vehicles as well.\nWe remain committed to delivering our targets quarter after quarter, year after year, earning your confidence along the way.\nAnd now I'd like to turn it to John to take you through the quarter and our outlook this year.\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nVP & CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Jim. In face of ongoing industry-wide supply chain disruption and unremitting pandemic hurdles, we continued to execute against our Ford+ plan, including strengthening our product portfolio, investing in electrification and other new and exciting opportunities, fundamental to growth and value creation.\nIn the first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in adjusted EBIT, resulting in a margin of 6.7%. The year-over-year decline in total company profits was driven by higher commodity prices and lower volume and mix, partially offset by higher net pricing as we take top line pricing while remaining disciplined with our incentive spend. Importantly, our operations outside of North America were profitable.\nGlobal wholesales were down 9%, consistent with our guidance and reflecting the continued supply chain issues. However, our run rate of vehicle production in North America improved significantly during the month of March, and we ended the quarter with an extremely healthy order bank. In fact, in the U.S. alone, our order bank is primed to deliver about $17 billion in revenue.\nFord Credit delivered another strong quarter. EBT was $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance. Free cash flow was $600 million negative, more than explained by unfavorable timing differences and working capital deterioration due to the higher inventory levels, which included about 53,000 vehicles on wheels, completed but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage.\nWe ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity, nearly $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively. This includes our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation to continue investing in our Ford+ priorities.\nNow let me briefly touch on business unit performance for the quarter. North America delivered $1.6 billion of EBIT with a margin of 7.1%. Now this is down year-over-year as net pricing improvements were more than offset by higher commodity costs, higher warranty expense, unfavorable mix and lower volume. The volume and mix impact primarily reflects supply constraints unique to full-size pickups in large utilities.\nSouth America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest quarterly EBIT margin in over 10 years. The region continues to focus on scaling its business for growth, especially pickup trucks and commercial vehicles.\nIn Europe, our operations delivered an EBIT margin of 3% despite a 9% decline in volumes. The underlying trajectory of our business continues to improve. However, the adverse impact of the near-term supply chain disruption is dampening our overall results.\nImportantly, we continue to be the #1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe. The transit has an extremely healthy order bank, and we recently launched the all-electric E-Transit in Turkey. FORDLiive continues to grow, helping our commercial customers improve vehicle uptime and, ultimately, their bottom line.\nAnd finally, Mustang Mach-E is now being sold online in most major markets. Europe is building momentum towards a fully electric future, expecting to reach 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2026.\nIn China, we posted a moderate loss in the quarter. However, our cost performance improved on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot and profit pillar for the region. Market share improved 20 basis points year-over-year, and the all-new Zephyr is off to a fast start. In the first quarter, China also continued to make progress towards our electrification strategy. We opened 10 more customer experience centers, now 35 in total, and made other investments to modernize our direct-to-consumer network.\nOur International Markets Group performed well in the first quarter, continuing to be solidly profitable despite supply constraints and suspension of our joint venture operations in Russia. The upcoming launch of the next-generation Ranger remains on track. And in March, we unveiled the next-generation Ranger Raptor and Everest.\nAnd finally, in Mobility, we continue to make steady progress towards scale commercialization of moving people and moving goods. In the first quarter, we divested our investments in both TransLoc and Spin, further rationalizing our portfolio with a focus on autonomous development.\nAnd now I'll share with you our current thinking about the remainder of 2022. For the full year, our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021, with adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. This reflects year-over-year growth in wholesales of 10% to 15% and assumes that semiconductor availability will improve in the second half, including the constraints that adversely impacted our full-size pickups and large utilities in North America in Q1. We also assumed in our guidance that disruptions in the supply chain and local vehicle manufacturing operations resulting from the renewed COVID-related health concerns and lockdowns in China do not further deteriorate our supply chains.\nNow relative to adjusted EBIT. On a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collective profitability outside of North America. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong but lower than 2021, and Mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat.\nOther assumptions factored into our guidance include: first, we have a very strong order bank, as Jim mentioned, for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick, along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well; second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment, including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix. The interplay role between volume and pricing will remain dynamic.\nAnd third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset by improvements in net pricing and mix. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures to continue impacting a broad range of costs. We are aggressively looking at all opportunities to offset this reality, including aggressively ramping up our efforts on additional cost reductions. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned, we anticipate strong but lower EBT, reflecting primarily the nonrecurrence of reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.\nOur results in the quarter, our balance-of-year outlook and commitment to our medium-term targets demonstrate the power of our Ford+ plan as we continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from these investments will be substantial.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear your questions and address what's on your mind. And so thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

Farley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ford Motor Company\n\nThanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. Well, some may have described 2021 as a breakthrough year for Ford, I would simply portray it as a year of important progress for the company. We strengthened our base business last year and now expect to deliver even stronger results this year. And just as critical, we started moving with real speed and ambition to build a modern Ford.\nOur true breakthroughs are still ahead of us, like rapidly scaling production of our popular new battery electric vehicles, like turning Ford Pro a new growth engine for our commercial customers businesses and ours, like building our intelligent software platform to revolutionize our customers' experience.\nEven with the recent momentum, I know some observers may remain skeptical that a 118-year-old company like Ford will emerge as a winner in these disruptive times in our industry. And I'm okay with that. We're going to compete like a challenger, speak with our actions, prove ourselves over time.\nSo let's dive into last year. As I mentioned, we have significantly improved our base business. In North America, our largest market, we have a very hot portfolio of new vehicles. We've now won awards of North America Truck and Utility of the Year for 2 years running. That's never happened by any company. The new Bronco, the Bronco Sport, the Maverick, the Mustang Mach-E, all of them, brand-new name plates for our lineup, all of them kits.\nLast month, we launched E-Transit. In the spring, we're in the middle of launching F-150 Lightning.\nFew people ask us any more about why we phased out sedans, and many more asking when they could take delivery of the new Bronco or Maverick or Lightning. So we're doing everything we can in our powers to increase our production and break constraints. We don't like making our customers wait, and we're taking action to ensure that they don't pay unreasonable markups.\nWe've also made progress outside of North America, and this is very important. Ford has been a one-legged stool for too long. We stayed in Europe and South America and other regions because we really believe we can create sustainably strong businesses in those markets. And we want to serve these customers with better, more connected and electric products and services.\nThe deep restructuring in Europe and South America have put us in a position to grow profitability going forward. In China, we're now set up to play a much bigger role in the EV boom going on there. We've quietly grown Lincoln into a strong contender in the world's largest luxury vehicle market. In fact, China is now the #1 Lincoln market globally.\nOur international markets group is profitable, and we're now preparing for the important launch of our next-generation Ranger pickup this year.\nWhile we remain in the teeth of the COVID crisis and semiconductor shortages, our overall business is still in great shape. And at the same time, we're rapidly making progress on key aspects of the Ford+ plan. And for customers, that means more distinctive products and solutions, more always on relationships with our brands and adding ever-improving user experiences.\nNow to deliver these things, we're building new muscles, and that certainly includes scaling up our production of electric vehicles, as I mentioned. We under-called the demand for our first wave of EVs. The Mustang Mach-E, the E-Transit, the F-150 Lightning. In the past 6 months, we doubled our 2023 planned capacity for EVs to 600,000 units a year.\nNow this required everything, from working with SK and LG to increase battery supplies to knocking down walls at our Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, while the mortar was still wet to make room to improve and build more Lightnings.\nOur team knows how to scale manufacturing, and we're now harnessing that capability to ramp up production of EVs.\nWe also have a task force dedicated to lowering the bill of materials for our bets, above and beyond just the usual decline in material costs. For example, on Mustang Mach-E, in just the last month, our team found $1,000 of opportunity per vehicle. And that's delivered through design simplification, vertical integration and leveraging our scale with supply chain as we ramp up production. And that team is just getting started.\nWe plan to take full advantage of our first-mover position in the fully electric pickup truck market, starting with Lightning. But there's much more to come. In the coming months, we'll break ground on the BlueOval City electric truck plant in Tennessee. It will be the largest, the most advanced manufacturing complex in our history, and it will produce Ford's second generation of a full-sized electric pickup in high volumes starting in 2025. And at the same time, we have 3 large-scale battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, which will be coming on stream with capacity to produce enough battery cells for more than 1 million vehicles a year. This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe.\nWe are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030, with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit, high-volume segments we compete. For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S. market.\nWe can't grow a profitable BEV business without a very healthy ICE business. And to do this, we're reducing complexity everywhere while increasing leveraging the benefits of our connectivity. Now this includes things like fewer top hats guided by customer demand and a judicious approach to vehicle content based on deep insights generated from that same vehicle data. We're also being disciplined with capital as we deploy that to our ICE products, recognizing that as a mix of BEVs increases, we will continue to manufacture ICE vehicles but with a focus on optimizing cash returns. So our goal is to continue to improve our automotive EBIT margins. Let me say that again. Our goal is to continue to improve our auto EBIT margins even as we ramp up the mix of BEVs.\nIn 2021, we began to bring our vision of an always on experience for retail and commercial customers to life. Our customers are realizing the benefits of our over-the-air software updates. But that's just the beginning.\nWe're using our hubs in places like Palo Alto to attract more and more great software engineers and technology specialists. And we're fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford. The hardware will always be important, but the software and the embedded systems will define the next generation of our vehicles' experiences.\nI think customers will be amazed at the benefits as we move to central compute rather than the distributed compute we have across all the supplier-provided modules today. Our human-centered interface professionals are now in one single organization, with authority over the in-car digital experiences, interfaces, screens and controls. And we're committed to providing an environment where software engineers can do the very best work of their careers.\nBefore I turn it over to John, let me close, the velocity of change at Ford is increasing. We're not seeking half measures. Fear of change and risk has never served legacy automakers well in the past couple of decades. We're done with incremental change. We have a clear plan, a bias fraction and whatever-it-takes mindset. We're confident our strong base business will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future.\nWe're recruiting incredible talent from outside the company to work with the best people from Ford. As excited as our customers are for that great portfolio we have in the market today, we can't wait to show them what's coming in the future.\nNow I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through the results for the quarter and our expectations for this year.\n\nJohn T. Lawler\n\nVP & CFO, Ford Motor Company\n\nThank you, Jim. In the face of ongoing challenges with semiconductor constraints and industry-wide supply chain disruptions, we executed our Ford+ plan, including closing out our global redesign, strengthening our product portfolio and investing in exciting new opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation.\nFor the year, we posted $10 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 7.3%. That's our strongest performance since 2016. We delivered right at the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusting for the reclass of our first quarter Rivian game to a special item. And despite a 6% decline in wholesale, our automotive business posted its strongest EBIT margin since 2016. North America delivered an 8.4% EBIT margin and is firmly on the glide path to a 10% EBIT margin.\nIn addition, our operations outside the U.S. collectively posted their best results since 2017.\nI'm very proud of the team's hard work, the resiliency last year as we rose to the challenge and optimized constrained production to protect customer orders, new launches, our electrification strategy and our most profitable vehicles. We also remain highly disciplined with our incentive spend and mix management, which, combined with improvement in warranty costs, more than offset commodity headwinds and supply chain-related production losses.\nFord Credit, whose profits and dividends are an important source of capital for us, delivered a strong year. EBT was $4.7 billion as auction values were at record highs and credit losses were near record lows.\nFree cash flow was $4.6 billion, and we ended the year with strong cash and liquidity, more than $36 billion and $52 billion, respectively, which now includes our stake in Rivian valued at $10.6 billion at the end of the year.\nIn 2021, we continue to advance our capital strategy given the improvements we're seeing in the underlying business. We reinstated the regular dividend at $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders. We also further strengthened our balance sheet by repurchasing $7.6 billion of high-cost debt, deleveraging the balance sheet and significantly reducing our ongoing interest expense. We introduced the industry's first fully integrated sustainable financing framework, covering both an auto OEM and its captive finance company. And in November, following the launch of the framework, we completed our inaugural $2.5 billion green bond issuance, which was met with incredible investor demand and will help fund our exciting BEV portfolio. Our strong balance sheet, including cash, provides a solid foundation to continue to invest in our Ford+ priorities.\nSo let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter. With a margin of 5.4%, adjusted EBIT was $2 billion, and we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Some modeled stronger EBIT for us in this quarter. We know that was largely driven by higher volume expectations relative to the 10% sequential increase we guided to in October and lower corporate other expenses.\nNorth America delivered $1.8 billion of profit with a margin of 7.1%. Volume was up 10% on a sequential basis as supply chain constraints eased and custom demand for our products remained strong. South America delivered a modest profit for the second consecutive quarter, and the business is now set up to deliver sustainable profitability. With restructuring of the legacy business complete, the region is now focused on strengthening Ford's position in the truck market, growing its new commercial vehicle business and enriching customer experiences. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to accelerate towards a 6% EBIT margin. However, the adverse effect of near-term supply chain disruption continues to mask that improvement. Importantly, we were the #1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the seventh consecutive year, and transit continues to have an extremely healthy order bank. Mustang Mach-E sales in the region are off to a strong start, with the order bank building momentum as we accelerate the transition to BEV.\nIn China, Lincoln continues to be a real bright spot and gain share in the highly profitable and growing premium segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record sales of the brand in China, contributing to an almost 50% increase for the year. We are expanding the Lincoln portfolio in 2022 with the launch of the all-new Zephyr. The order bank for that vehicle opened recently and is off to a fast start.\nIn the fourth quarter, we also achieved an important electrification milestone in China as we began local production and customer deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E. Our direct-to-customer model for Mach-E allows people to order online and through 25 Ford select city stores.\nOur international markets group performed well in the fourth quarter and had a record year playing to its strengths, especially from our flagship Ranger pickup, which delivered full year segment share of 14.9%, up 1.1 percentage points year-over-year. We also announced major investments in both South Africa and Thailand to modernize production and launch the next-generation Ranger from 4 assembly plants later this year.\nAnd in mobility, we've made steady progress towards the scaled commercialization of moving people and moving goods, and we are confident in Argo's progress in delivering a Level 4 autonomous vehicle solution. And in addition, we are rationalizing our investment portfolio and focusing on autonomous development.\nNow I'll share with you our current thinking about 2022. We expect supply constraints to remain fluid throughout the year, reflecting a variety of factors, including semiconductors and COVID. Based on what we see now, we believe our full year wholesales will be up about 10% to 15% in 2022, with a high single to low digit decline in the first quarter, reflecting supplier shortages related to Omicron shutdown and semiconductors.\nFor the full year, we expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that's up 15% to 25% versus 2021. And the high end of the range equates to an adjusted company EBIT margin of 8% and our North America business at 10% EBIT margin, which, if we achieve, would be 1 year earlier than the target we shared with you last May.\nNow turning to GAAP results for a minute. It's important to point out that each quarter, we will mark-to-market our investment in Rivian, which sits in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This is not something we can forecast. The mark-to-market may cause volatility in our quarterly GAAP, net income and EPS results.\nSo looking at how our adjusted EBIT guidance rolls up. Our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collected profitability outside of North America as we realize the full benefits of our global redesign efforts. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong but lower than 21 -- 2021 profits, and we expect mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Lastly, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion.\nNow other assumptions we factored into our guidance include: first, we expect customer demand enthusiasm to remain strong for our new and iconic nameplates. We will have a full year of production of the award-winning Bronco and Maverick in addition to a robust BEV lineup with Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning, all in production. Second, with wholesales up about 10% to 15%, we anticipate the pricing environment to remain strong, although the interplay between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. Third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures, which will impact a broad range of costs. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong in 2022 as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned, we anticipate lower EBT reflecting primarily nonrecurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.\nMost importantly, we're committed to our Ford+ plan, and we'll continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial.\nSo that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

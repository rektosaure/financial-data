You may begin.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVP Investor Relations and Risk Management, CooperCompanies\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to CooperCompanies's Q4 and FY 2025 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to revenues, EPS, cash flows, interest, FX, and tax rates, tariffs, and other financial guidance and expectations, strategic and operational initiatives, market conditions and trends, and product launches and demand.\nForward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data, or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome everyone to today's earnings call. I'll start by highlighting three key strategic priorities and then move into our quarterly results and guidance. Our first priority is to deliver consistent market share gains for CooperVision. We've accelerated the global rollout of our MyDay Premium Daily Silicone Hydrogel Lens portfolio, and we're seeing momentum build. We're executing on numerous global private label contracts and winning new ones, and we're strengthening branded sales, especially among independent optometrists.\nWe're also looking forward to several upcoming product launches to further strengthen our positioning and ensure CooperVision delivers steady revenue growth throughout fiscal 2026, with the strongest performance expected in Q3 and Q4 as MyDay achieves bold traction. Second is our continuing commitment to earnings and free cash flow. This quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of beating consensus earnings expectations, and our fiscal 2026 earnings guidance exceeds current consensus expectations driven by significant cost savings from our recent reorganization.\nAdditionally, for the past two years, we've reported double-digit earnings growth, and we're targeting making it three years in a row. And importantly, these earnings are turning into cash, with $150 million of free cash flow delivered in Q4 beating expectations. I'm also pleased to announce this momentum is continuing, and we're raising our fiscal 2026 to 2028 free cash flow target to more than $2.2 billion. Our entire organization is aligned behind these efforts as free cash flow became a bonus metric in 2024 alongside revenue, and earnings. Third is our attention to returning capital to shareholders.\nWe repurchased nearly $200 million of stock in fiscal Q4, bringing our total fiscal year repurchases to almost $300 million, or roughly two-thirds of our 2025 free cash flow. For fiscal 2026, we expect to allocate a similar percentage to share repurchases, with the remaining portion targeted to debt paydown. To support this effort and to reinforce our commitment to share repurchases being a core component of our long-term capital allocation strategy, the board authorized an increase in our share repurchase plan to $2 billion in September.\nBefore moving into the quarterly details, I want to emphasize that our board and management team remain highly focused on driving long-term shareholder value. We've accelerated share repurchases, insiders have bought stock, we've completed significant reorg and integration activity to increase profitability and cash flow, and we've been winning new contracts and solidifying long-term customer partnerships at CooperVision and CooperSurgical.\nAdditionally, we initiated an evaluation of strategic alternatives earlier this year and presented our initial findings to our board in October, alongside ongoing governance discussions around the timing of our chair's transition to retirement. Today, we have taken the next step by issuing a press release announcing a formal strategic review to ensure that we explore every opportunity to unlock long-term shareholder value. We also announced the transition of our chair role from Bob Weiss to independent board member Colleen Jay.\nAnd finally, we're adding total shareholder return to our executive performance share plans to further align leadership incentives to our stock's performance. With that, let's move to the Q4 results. Consolidated revenues were up 4.6% year-over-year, or up 3.4% organically, to a quarterly record of $1.065 billion. Operating margins improved meaningfully, and non-GAAP earnings grew 11% to $1.15. For CooperVision, we reported revenue of $710 million, up 4.9%, or up 3.2% organically. These results were consistent with our guidance driven by improved global availability of MyDay, partially offset by market softness in China, and certain areas in EMEA.\nOverall, the global contact lens market continues to trend toward premium offerings, which is a positive for our MyDay portfolio, including our premium private label MyDay business, but it does create headwinds for clariti and our older hydrogel lenses. On an organic basis, by category, torics and multifocals grew 5%, and spheres grew 2%. By modality, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 5%, with double-digit growth in MyDay and declines in clariti. Our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, grew 2%, and MiSight delivered strong growth of 37%. Regionally, the Americas grew 5%, led by strength in daily silicone hydrogel lenses.\nEMEA grew 3%, strengthening our number one market position, led by MyDay and Biofinity. This was slightly below expectations due to market weakness in a few countries, but this doesn't appear to be tied to consumer activity, and we've already seen a pickup this quarter. Asia-Pac was flat, as growth in MyDay was offset primarily by a 28% decline in China, driven by continued weakness in low-margin e-commerce channels, where we're not chasing aggressive pricing activity. Moving to products, MyDay delivered a strong quarter, led by torics and Energys.\nWe're continuing to execute on the private label deals we won in Q3, and I'm pleased to report that we won quite a few more contracts in Q4, several of which are in the US and Europe, so you'll see those in the coming months. Momentum is robust, and we're seeing increasing fitting activity, with especially strong interest in our premium comfort MyDay Energys lens, featuring our innovative DigitalBoost technology, which we expect to launch in Europe in Q2 of this year, from our MyDay multifocal, which continues to roll out in the Asia-Pac region, and from our MyDay toric parameter expansion, which is expanding around the world.\nWe'll also be launching MyDay MiSight and MyDay toric multifocal in 2026, and we expect those offerings to be received incredibly well. For clariti, we're progressing with repositioning the product family in Asia-Pac, and we're seeing early positive signs with products such as clariti's new 3 Add multifocal launch, which delivered double-digit growth in the Americas. Regarding FRPs, Biofinity delivered solid performance in the Americas and EMEA, led by multifocals, Energys, and our innovative made-to-order lenses, but remained soft in Asia-Pac, especially outside of Japan.\nThis was similar to last quarter, with continued weakness in markets such as China. Turning to myopia control, MiSight delivered strong growth of 37%, driven by robust performance in the Americas and another record-setting quarter in EMEA. Our back-to-school campaigns boosted fitting activity, while customer engagement initiatives and new pricing models supported higher purchase volumes. We expect this momentum to continue into fiscal 2026, with the upcoming launches of MiSight in Japan and MyDay MiSight across Europe, both scheduled for fiscal Q2.\nPrivate label programs in Europe and other select markets are also proving highly successful, and we expect more deals to be signed this year. With MiSight growing 30% in fiscal 2025, reaching $104 million in sales, we expect growth of at least 20% to 25 for fiscal 2026, with further strength in 2027 as product launches gain traction. To conclude on vision, let me share details of our performance relative to the market. This is calendar quarter data, so it's apples to apples with our competitors. In calendar Q3, we grew 5%, in line with the market. On a year-to-date basis for the three calendar quarters of 2025, we've grown 4%, also in line with the market.\nCooperVision has gained share for 17 straight years, and we remain focused on achieving that goal for an 18th consecutive year in calendar 2025. Turning to CooperSurgical, we delivered quarterly revenue of $356 million, up 4%, or up 3.9% organically. This was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by solid execution. Within fertility, revenues were $141 million, up 1%, in line with expectations given last year's 13% comp. Growth was driven by market share gains in EMEA and strong global genomics performance, partially offset by softness in the US. As we enter fiscal 2026, we're optimistic that this will be a stronger year.\nWe're seeing encouraging traction with new RFP wins from some major fertility clinics. We're receiving significant interest in Witness, our automated lab tracking system, and our genomics portfolio is seeing an uptick in momentum following the recent launch of several new tests. For the overall fertility market, consumer spending remains tight, especially in Asia Pacific, and clinics are continuing to manage spending carefully, but we are seeing some early positive signs, including improving cycle activity in the US, and growing global clinic interest in new technology.\nWe remain highly optimistic about the long-term outlook for fertility, given the underlying fundamentals supported by the estimate that one in six people globally are expected to experience infertility at some point in their lives, underscoring the long-term significance and resilience of this market. Moving to office and surgical, sales were $215 million, up 6%, and up 6% organically. Paragard grew 16% following a softer Q3, driven by strong demand for our single-hand inserter upgrade that was launched earlier this year.\nMedical devices grew 3%, led by double-digit growth in our labor and delivery portfolio, and a 35% increase in our OBP surgical line of innovative single-use lighted cordless surgical retractors. These gains were partially offset by softness in legacy products. Moving to fiscal revenue guidance, for CooperVision, we're guiding fiscal Q1 to 3.5% to 4.5 organic growth as we continue stair-stepping higher with execution around ongoing contract wins. For the full year, we're guiding to 4.5% to 5.5, assuming the market grows 4% to 5.\nOur expectation is that current momentum will result in strong share gains in Q3 and Q4, but we're maintaining conservatism to avoid having guidance be too back-end loaded. For CooperSurgical, we're guiding Q1 to 2% to 3 growth and full year to 4% to 5 growth. Within this, we're forecasting only a modest improvement in fertility, which we're optimistic will prove conservative given some of the recent market trends, along with much easier comps. Before turning the call over to Brian, I want to thank the entire Cooper team for their outstanding execution this quarter.\nDelivering strong results during a period of significant organizational change reflects our team's commitment to building a more streamlined and efficient company, and it speaks volumes to the company's dedication to excellence. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Al and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to the earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For the fourth fiscal quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.065 billion, up 4.6%, and up 3.4% organically. Gross margin declined marginally, as expected, to 66.2%, driven by tariffs and product mix, partially offset by positive foreign exchange. Operating expenses were flat, reflecting disciplined cost management, and operating income increased a healthy 9% to a 27% margin. Interest expense was $23.7 million, and the effective tax rate was 14.2%.\nNon-GAAP EPS grew 11% to $1.15, with 198 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was strong at $150 million, with CapEx of $98 million. Net debt was $2.4 billion, improving our bank-defined leverage ratio to 1.76 times. Lastly, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for $197.3 million, leaving approximately $1 billion of availability under our $2 billion repurchase plan. Before moving to guidance, let me recap the reorganization and integration work we completed in Q4. We began executing this effort in early Q3 and moved quickly with a clear focus on improving operational efficiency and reducing back-office costs.\nBy leveraging prior IT investments supported by AI capabilities, we integrated key support functions and are unlocking meaningful productivity gains. At the same time, we completed significant acquisition-related integration work. From a financial perspective, we recorded approximately $89 million in charges associated with all of this activity and expect annual pre-tax savings to be roughly $50 million or $0.19 starting in fiscal 2026.Beyond operating margin expansion and free cash flow benefits, these savings strengthen our ability to invest in high-return opportunities, repurchase stock, and pay down debt, fully aligned with our commitment to long-term value creation.\nMoving to guidance and starting with Q1, we're guiding to consolidated revenues of $1.019 to 1.03 billion, representing roughly 3% to 4 consolidated organic growth. CooperVision's revenue is expected to be in the range of $693 to 700 million, up 3.5% to 4.5 organically, and CooperSurgical's revenue is projected to be $327 to 330 million, up 2% to 3 organically. For earnings, we're guiding to non-GAAP EPS of $1.02 to 1.04, with improving operating margins from strong operational leverage offset by lower gross margins due to tariffs and mix. Interest expense is expected to be around $24 million, and the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16.\nFor the full year, fiscal 2026, we're guiding to consolidated revenues of roughly $4.3 to 4.34 billion, reflecting 4.5% to 5.5 organic growth. CooperVision is expected to be in the range of $2.9 to 2.925 billion, up 4.5% to 5.5 organically, and CooperSurgical is expected to be in the range of $1.4 to 1.413 billion, up 4% to 5 organically. For earnings, we're guiding to non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to 4.60. This assumes another year of strong operating margin improvement driven by operating expense leverage offset by lower gross margins due to tariffs and mix. Interest expense is expected to be around $85 million, assuming no share repurchases or changes in Fed policy.\nNote that if the Fed does lower rates next week by a quarter point, interest expense would be reduced by roughly $2 million in fiscal 2026. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16. Free cash flow for fiscal 2026 is expected to improve to $575 to 625 million, driven by stronger operating cash flow from higher profits, working capital improvements, and lower one-time costs. CapEx will also decline on an absolute basis as CooperVision's investment cycle winds down. These positives will temporarily be somewhat offset by roughly $70 million tied to our reorg and final payments on building activity, including our new CooperVision R&D facility.\nFrom fiscal 2026 through 2028, we expect to generate over $2.2 billion in free cash flow. This outlook reflects two key drivers. First, consistent improvements in operating cash flow from higher profits, lower one-time items, and tighter working capital management supported by a streamlined and AI-enabled operating structure. And second, CapEx normalizing in fiscal 2027 to roughly 5% of revenues, covering both maintenance and growth investments. Lastly, on cash flow at the divisional level, CooperSurgical generates more free cash flow per revenue dollar than CooperVision, but we expect that gap to narrow materially in 2027 as CooperVision's CapEx declines and free cash flow accelerates.\nFrom a capital deployment standpoint, we remain committed to investing in growth and innovation, repurchasing stock, and reducing debt. Lastly, as you'll see in our 10-K tomorrow, we have successfully remediated the material weakness related to certain IT general control failures from fiscal 2024. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for questions.\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you've dialed in and would like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you're called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your headset to ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. We do request for today's session that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Johnson\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nThank you, guys. Good evening and congratulations on the progress in the quarter. Al, I wanted to talk, I guess, first on clariti. Obviously, a good MyDay number in the period. Did you give a number for how much clariti was down? And I think that's been about a $400 million annualized line for you guys. What is maybe the floor on that? And as that continues to come down and MyDay grows, do you see those MyDay gross margins eventually within the next year or two getting to clariti gross margin levels? Thanks.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. I'll let Brian comment on the gross margins because we made a lot of progress there. Yeah. clariti was down a couple percent this quarter, and it approached $400 million this year. So it's still a pretty sizable product line for us. We're doing a lot of work on it right now. We've got some new products that we're launching, we're excited about. The 3 Add multifocal in the US is being received really well. But on the flip side of that, we're doing some repositioning in places like Asia-Pac to put that lens family more in the entry-level space that we want it to be. And so we're going to continue to have some push and pulls here, I think, over the next couple quarters.\nBut I do still think that there's a place for that lens, and it has the opportunity to be very successful. If there's ever a situation where the market moves a little bit more towards mass market or is a little bit more price conscious, I think you'll see that lens take off. But in the meantime, to hit on the start of your question, Jeff, yeah, good quarter for MyDay. We are making a lot of progress there. We have a lot of really exciting stuff going on. You want to comment on the margins?\n\nBrian Andrews\n\nCFO and Treasurer, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I won't comment on individual product line gross margins, but I will say that the gross margins for the family of products of daily silicone hydrogel lenses is below CooperVision's gross margins. I talked about mix being part of the reason for the gross margin decline in Q4. It'll be part of the reason for the gross margin decline year over year next year. And as we sell more daily silicone hydrogels, I would expect that we'll still have pressure on the gross margin line. Now, that being said, we do get more revenue per patient when we sell daily SiHys. We get more gross profit dollars, and we get more operating income dollars.\nAnd so as we leverage our prior investment activity and a more streamlined organization, I would expect we'll be able to drive operating margin expansion and earnings growth despite some of the headwinds we'll be seeing from the gross margin line.\n\nJeff Johnson\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAll right. Thank you, Brian. And maybe just one quick follow-up. Just whenever you guys give calendar versus fiscal numbers, it always opens it up to a question like this. But if you did 5% growth in calendar Q3, Al, and you did 3.2% in fiscal Q4, it would seem to imply a pretty weak October, I believe, if I'm thinking about that correctly. But just tell me why I'm wrong there, or at least kind of help reconcile those two, the 3.2%, and the 5% numbers. Thanks.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. It was the flip side, Jeff. It was actually the beginning of the quarter, the overlap in the beginning of the quarter, not the end of the quarter. October was a good month.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Al, could you please talk about the strategic review? How long will it take? And what's your reaction to those who have advocated for splitting up CVI and CSI and adding new board members?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. We announced the strategic review. For those who haven't seen it, we issued a press release concurrently with the earnings release. We're going to take a look at options out there because we do want to drive shareholder value, right? And we look at that. And we were doing that work proactively with our board over the summer. We actually presented strategic analysis and a strategic review to them in the month of October. We obviously put that out publicly.\nWe'll provide an update on any activity on our next earnings call, which is the beginning of March. That's our Q1 earnings call, unless something material happens beforehand. And if it does, obviously, we'll issue a press release or make a statement on that. So outside of that, I'm not going to comment too much on it. But yeah, it's underway.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nSo Al, no comment on, I mean, just maybe your latest thoughts. Obviously, there are others out there now advocating for splitting up CVI and CSI. Has your position changed? Just love to hear your latest thoughts on that. And I'll leave it at that. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. My position has not changed on that. We discussed that, actually, Larry, at your conference in September. You raised it, and I gave my opinion on that. My opinion has not changed, which is our job is to drive long-term shareholder value. If taking certain actions are beneficial for our long-term shareholders, then we need to evaluate those. As I talked about in the September meeting that we did, I believe if we drive value in this business, that we'll maximize long-term shareholder value. That's what we're doing. That's what we did with the reorg. That's what we're doing with stock buybacks.\nThat's what we're doing driving cash flow. That's what we're doing in a whole slew of different ways. But we're going to look at the value of this business and do what's best for our long-term shareholders. That's our job as executives of a public company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Block\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Al, I think your contact lens market growth expectations for 2026, I think you said for the market, 4% to 5. Year to date, the market's 4%. I don't know. It just seems like industry pricing power is fading a bit. So just talk, if you don't mind, about sort of the market growth assumption or construct. What's behind that assumption? If we do finish this year at four, even a tad below, what's responsible for market growth acceleration if pricing power is decelerating? And then I'll ask the follow-up.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Yeah, John, I might go the other direction a little bit on that one. As a market, we grew 4% in Q1, calendar Q1, and 4% in calendar Q2. The market grew 5% in calendar Q3. So it actually increased this last quarter. I do think that we're going to be in a 4% to 5 market growth for this year. I'd be really surprised if we're not. From a pricing perspective, I think global pricing for next year will end up being somewhere around that 1% on a true global net basis. So probably pretty similar, frankly, to what it was this year, which leads me to believe we'll probably be somewhere in that 4% to 5 range next year. I do think this quarter, which was 5%, was probably a little bit better representation of where the market is. So I say 4% to 5, but honestly, I think it'll be closer to 5% next year.\n\nJon Block\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then just to shift gears, I think a different approach in terms of getting the CVI numbers for you guys, rather than from a product standpoint, just from a geography standpoint. I mean, Asia-Pac falling around 0% for fiscal 2025. It was up, gosh, 7% in 2024. And then at some point, this thing was growing 13%, 14% prior year. So for fiscal 2026, is it sort of like a more of the same argument in Americas and EMEA for the most part? But we just see that Asia-Pac claw back a little bit closer to mid-single digits, a function of MyDay, but also a function of getting some of these quasi one-timers behind you. Just looking for any direction from a geographic perspective.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. I think you're right, Jon. At the end of the day, we had some struggles in Asia-Pac this year. It was heavily focused on the pure-play e-commerce channel. That's where we lost share. I mentioned that China was down 28% in Q4. As you remember, it was down kind of mid-20s in Q1 and Q3. So our China business is quite a bit smaller this year than it was the year before. And again, heavily focused on low-margin business. That's the reason that you've seen our revenues come down and be a little bit softer, but you haven't seen the impact on our profit. Now, we clearly do not chase revenues at all costs.\nWe would never do that. And that's a great example of where we don't do it. We're not chasing the market where we're seeing some participants with super aggressive pricing out there. We're maintaining fiscal responsibility and sensibility around how we operate. What I will say is, as we move into fiscal 2026, these markets like China, the pure-play e-commerce, and some other markets have become a much smaller percent of our overall business. So we're not going to see the same detriment in 2026 that we saw in 2025.\nOur next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. This is Lily on for Robbie. Thanks so much for taking the question. The guide is a bit more back-end loaded from a revenue growth perspective. So what gives the confidence in growth stepping up over the course of the year? And what are some of the variables across vision and surgical that we should think about as improving over 2026?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Thanks, Lily. It's a little bit back-end loaded, but it's not that much back-end loaded. I mean, we intentionally did not get overly aggressive on Q3 and Q4 so that we wouldn't have a situation where it was heavily back-end loaded. Even though, frankly, I'm pretty optimistic we're going to have a strong Q3 and Q4 given where MyDay is today and the momentum that we're seeing. But to answer your question, it ties to that. It ties to the MyDay sales that we have right now, the momentum that we're seeing out there. We want a number of additional private label contracts during Q4. As I mentioned, a number of those are in the US and in Europe.\nSo a number of people on the phone will start seeing some of those as we get into 2026. So I'm excited about what's going on with MyDay and the progress that we're making. That's going to be one of your biggest drivers that's going to push forward the CooperVision business. When it comes to CooperSurgical, we're forecasting a relatively similar year next year to this year. And that includes kind of being conservative on fertility. I mean, I'm optimistic fertility picks up. And we certainly have easier comps that we're going to report against that's going to help us a little bit. But we want to stay a little conservative on fertility, also, and consumer spending.\nWhen I think about CooperSurgical, remember that we launched the single-hand inserter for Paragard at the beginning of last year. So we had a really strong Q1. That's the reason that we're guiding a little bit softer here for Q1. Having said that, Paragard just had a really strong Q4 and finished to the year. So we'll see how that plays out because, frankly, guidance for CooperSurgical assumes flat, low single-digit growth in Paragard. And we did quite a bit better than that this year.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the improved free cash flow outlook. What's driving that increase relative to the prior guide? And is any of that step up coming from decreased investment in SG&A or R&D? Thanks so much.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Yeah. The way to think about free cash flow is it is not back-end loaded. It's just consistent performance, consistent execution. And we'll step up nicely this year by continuing to do exactly what we've been doing. I mean, we just posted $150 million in Q4, which was strong. We're going to continue to post strong quarters here by delivering earnings growth, by doing some of the working capital management that Brian mentioned. Then as we move into next year, you're going to see CooperVision's CapEx come down. Our maintenance and growth CapEx is about 5% of revenues. It's somewhere in that range, right?\nWe've been running upper single digits. So you're going to see that come down as we make final payments on our MyDay lines this year. Then we're also completing some relatively significant business activity. The last thing we really have this year is our new CooperVision R&D facility going up. So as those roll off and you continue to see profits grow, 2027 is going to be a nice free cash flow year. Then I think it's just more consistency the next year. So we're saying over $2.2 billion now. Frankly, we feel pretty good about that number, the over on the $2.2 billion side of it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Bednar\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to start first with, I think I heard you right there on any repurchases assumed in earnings guidance for fiscal 2026. But I thought you referenced in the supplementary PR today that you're allocating free cash entirely to repurchases. So just how to reconcile that? Is that just conservatism, or do I have something incorrect there?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. We spent about 2/3 of our cash flow this past year on share repurchases. We're targeting spending about 2/3 of our free cash flow on share repurchases in 2026. That will be EPS accretive. We did not include that in the guidance range.\n\nJason Bednar\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. All right. Got it. And then as a follow-up, Al, good to see the TSR addition to the comp plans. I think a lot of us will be happy to see that. I did want to ask just if you could discuss how you landed on Colleen as the next chairman for the business. I know it's maybe a bit of a hot-button issue right now, just given some of the items out there in the public domain. But if you could just discuss why that was the right move for the board in the context of other options, whether currently on the board or not on the board. Thank you.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. We've been having conversations over the last year with Bob, and driven by Bob. I mean, Bob's a great guy, right? He has a ton of value. But he's gotten to the point where he's saying, \"Hey, I want to go into full retirement. And it's that time for me.\" So we were talking about it in the context of transitioning the chair leadership over and how that should happen and when that should happen. And this was the right time to do that. Colleen has been with us for a number of years. She's fantastic. She's super smart. She was a top executive over at Procter & Gamble. She's got global experience. She's got branding experience.\nShe brings a lot to the table. And she just does a really nice job. And as I said, she adds a lot of value across the board, which is great. She was the one who probably six months ago brought up the TSR and said, \"Hey, we need to roll the TSR into here and look at shareholder returns and make sure we're aligning executive comp even closer to the stock's performance.\" And she brought that together with our consultants and so forth and put a plan together. And yeah, as I mentioned, we're going to be rolling that in. So I think she's the perfect person to step in as the chair. And Bob's plan is to continue to work with her and transition the role over to her to ensure it's a really smooth process.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nHey, everybody. I'm just curious on with the strategic review, your willingness to take short-term dilution to create longer-term value, and how you kind of balance the short-term with the long-term, and also how you think about consolidation and then contact lens space. Are there potential synergies there or antitrust risk with actions like that?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nWell, I think that, I mean, you're always going to have some of those questions around short-term investments and short-term activity and the impact on the long-term, be it across the board, right? Product launches or product development or any number of moves that you can potentially make. So I think the important thing is what we said, which is, \"Hey, we've done some work on a strategic review here.\" And people have asked the question about what does that mean and what actions can you take and so forth. And what I want to be clear about, and that we issued the press release, is we've done a bunch of work on that.\nWe're rolling up our sleeves to do more work on that. And we're taking a serious look at all the different alternatives that are out there, be it a number of things, frankly, that we put in that press release. So I'm not going to go into all the details behind that other than to say we are rolling up our sleeves. We're working with our advisors. We're looking at the different alternatives that are out there. And we want to ensure that we're driving long-term shareholder value. And that's our heavy focus.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nAll right. That's fair. And then gross margins down in 2026, just trying to understand exactly how you're getting operating margin leverage. Is SG&A not growing in 2026? And how much are you going to be cutting in the business?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nWell, sure. I mean, I think when you look at it, you can just plug the numbers in. And you can see that OpEx itself, or SG&A, if you will, is not going to grow very much because that's where we're set right now. So this is not additional cuts. This isn't like we need to go do things. We had this reorg activity planned out a while ago, and we completed it aggressively. And I think the team here did a fantastic job doing it aggressively and getting it done. And you can see that in the SG&A or in the OpEx, if you will, in our Q4 as reported results. You should assume to continue to see that level of excellence in terms of spending, supporting the top line, and driving leverage on a go-forward basis.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking the questions. So one follow-up on an earlier question around your sort of intention, expectation of gaining share here in the fourth calendar quarter. Maybe just talk about where you see the various business lines inflecting. This is in vision, obviously. Just some color as to which catalysts you think are kind of lifting off a little bit in the last month or so of the year. And then I have one follow-up.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure, Matt. That's a really good question. You'll remember last year in Q4, we did not have a particularly good quarter. We had some competitors launching product, and they had a lot of activity going on. It was one of the weaker quarters that we've had with respect to the market in a long time. We are comping against that. We are in a significantly better position in this calendar Q4 than we were in last calendar Q4. What it comes down to is just weakness last year and strength this year.\nA lot of that ties right to the topics we've been discussing, starting with MyDay. I do think we have an excellent opportunity to close this calendar year strong. When you compare that to last year's weakness, it should be a pretty good number. Well, I said it in the call. We're 17 straight years of market share gains, and we have not given up on making that 18. So we'll see how things close out.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. And then the follow-up question earlier on this as well, the sort of separation you've talked about and you've answered how you feel about it creating shareholder value. Given that it's been sort of, it feels like these reporting lines and operating-wise, it feels like it has been running separately or independently in many ways. And some might say ready to separate for some time. If that's the case, if you've looked at this before, what is changing now, given sort of the new board involvement and new investor involvement, that you think could make this possible now from a tax basis? Is it a get the restructuring done, and it's a tuned-up, upgraded portfolio that we think will get more interest? What would you say? Thanks.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nWell, I think that, I mean, if you talk about a separation, it is a negative in that it'll create dyssynergies. It is a negative from a tax perspective. Having said that, you've seen a number of companies, whether it's in the med device space or med tech more broadly, or even just more broadly, just saying companies who have looked at their portfolios, who have different businesses within their umbrella, so to speak. And they've looked at different ways to say, \"Hey, I want to try to unlock value. And I'm going to spin off my diabetes business, or I'm going to spin this off, or I'm going to spin that off, or I'm going to look at different strategic alternatives.\"\nI think that's good hygiene. I think that's important to do. And now is an appropriate time for us to do that. We made a ton of progress at CooperVision to position ourselves here to really get growing again and taking market share. We made a ton of progress in CooperSurgical with our fertility business. We're going to do great in fertility. So I think when you look at the businesses right now, it's just fair to ask the question, which is, are there strategic moves that we can make that unlock shareholder value? That's one of them. I think it's important for us to roll up our sleeves and evaluate that. That's what we're committed to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Saxon from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Saxon\n\nAnalyst, Needham & Company\n\nYeah. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon. Maybe I'll start with CSI, just on Paragard. Al, I think you said flat to up low single digit for fiscal 2026. It looks like the competitive IUD is going to launch in the first half of calendar 2026. Is there anything embedded in that Paragard expectation as it relates to that launch? And then when you first acquired it, you talked about the margin profile really strong. Has there been any meaningful change to that margin profile? And then I'll have one follow-up.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure, David. A couple of things. Yeah, there is the competitor product that was approved. I have no idea if it's going to launch or when it's going to launch or anything else about it. We did factor in some conservatism, if you will, into my guidance of kind of flat to up a couple of percent, assuming that there is a competitive launch. Now, I'm forgetting off the top of my head. Brian will probably know. I think Paragard grew 7% this year. So I'm optimistic we'll have another good year. But yes, we did factor in a little conservatism around the potential for a competitor launch. I will say the margins have come down a little bit because of the single-handed serter launch, that activity. Nothing that I would classify as material. But yeah, the gross margins are a little bit lower on that product.\n\nDavid Saxon\n\nAnalyst, Needham & Company\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just on CVI, so the Asia-Pac e-commerce dynamics, I mean, it sounds like we'll wrap that in the fiscal first quarter. But any residual impact from the distributor channel inventory dynamic you talked about a couple of quarters ago or the private label conversion from clariti to MyDay, just how we should think about those moving pieces as it relates to fiscal 2026. Thanks so much.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah. As we think about that from an Asia-Pac perspective, I think you're still going to have a little bit of that noise, frankly, in Q1. We factored that into the guidance, right? We did 3.2 globally, and we factored in 3.5 to 4.5 as a company. We factored in continuing weakness in Asia-Pac in Q1. So whether we see that or not or how much that changes, we'll see. We'll play that out. But you can see some of that, I think, as you continue to transition.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Young Li from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nYoung Li\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess to start, maybe a question about the pipeline. I did hear that you're launching some new products that can contribute to growth. But some of your competitors have been talking more and more about next-generation contact lenses and materials. I was wondering if you can comment sort of where you are with your program.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. We have some great stuff going on in R&D. A couple of things that I'm not going to get into, but that I'm super excited about. We have some launches going on right now that I talked about. We have some stuff like MyDay, MiSight. I mean, that is market-leading innovation. First of all, we're the only contact lens company with an FDA-approved product for myopia control in MiSight. And now we're launching MiSight on a silicone hydrogel platform. We're one of the leading brands out there in MyDay. I mean, you can't get much more exciting and innovative than that. And that's coming here in Q2.\nWe've got some other really cool innovation and stuff, including some material work and so forth that we're doing internally. So I'm not going to start touting that right now. It's not the time to do that. But suffice it to say, we have some good exciting stuff going on ourselves. And we have some product launch activity that's pretty exciting right in front of us.\n\nYoung Li\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for that. So I guess the follow-up question just on the fertility business. Can you maybe go a little bit more into detail on the assumptions for growth next year, talking about the geographic variances between the US and as well as the impact from consumers?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with fertility. I happen to believe that fertility by the end of the year will end up growing mid-single digits. I think we'll grow a little bit faster than that. I think some of that's going to come because of the easier comp. Some of that's going to come because consumer levels just level off in Asia-Pac where it's been weaker. Some of that's going to come because you have some pretty cool technology upgrades that are working their way through the system right now, including by us. You're going to see some fertility clinics upgrading.\nHaving said that, that is not what we factored into our guidance for this year. We factored in a more conservative expectation around fertility because I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. So when we look at it from a guidance perspective, it's kind of market more in the low single digits and us growing more in the mid-single digits.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Navann Ty from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nNavann Ty\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. On the MyDay momentum, can you discuss the revenue contribution of the MyDay private label contracts in Asia Pacific throughout 2026 and 2027? And then on fertility, could you provide more details on the recently improving cycles you have called out and any changes in competitive landscapes between you, Vitrolife, and Cook? And I don't know if you can give some details on the new technologies the clinics are interested in. Thank you.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies",
    "content2": "Sure. A number of things there. I'll answer the last one first because some of the new technology you may have just seen or if anyone follows it at ASRM, which is the big fertility conference here in the US, we just launched three new genomics tests that are being received incredibly well. We have some other technology advancements that we're going to be launching this year within our genomic space and also within our capital space. Then we've got some super exciting stuff that we're working on in our R&D side that I'm excited to get out in the coming years. I'm going to step back to the MyDay momentum.\nI talked about that last quarter and that we were winning contracts. We've been executing on those contracts. A lot of that was tied to Asia-Pac. As I mentioned, we're now seeing contract wins in EMEA and in the US. You're going to see that momentum build as we move into Q3 and Q4. So that's a process that's going to happen. That's why I talk about the stair-step improvements because we have to manufacture the product. We have to label it, package it. We have to get it over into the hands of the retailer, the key account, whomever it is that's selling that product. And we have to get it launched.\nSo it does take a little bit of time. We clearly took a step forward here in Q4, and we're going to take a step forward again. And then we're going to take another step forward as we execute on those contracts. This is not the first time we've done it. I've seen this many times over the years here at CooperVision, and it's going to happen again this time. So I won't give you specific numbers on that, but I will just say that as you win those contracts and as you execute on those contracts, just over the quarters, you start picking up energy on that. And we see that momentum right now picking up from a fitting activity.\nAnd that's the key. The first step is get product in people's hands, get the fitting activity increasing and so forth, and it transfers over to the sales. And you see that momentum building. And that's what we're seeing. And that's what I'm referencing. So I won't give you specific numbers on that, but hopefully, it gives you enough color to kind of get comfortable with it.\n\nNavann Ty\n\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you. That's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Citi)\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHi. This is Anthony for Joanne. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk about your expectations for MiSight and the myopia management portfolio for fiscal 2026? Thank you. For MiSight for fiscal 2026?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. We closed the year out well, right? We had a good solid quarter. I think we're going to have a good year next year. As I mentioned, I think we'll do at least 20% to 25 in fiscal 2026. There's a lot of reasons to believe that we're going to be stronger than that. But we also have this MiSight launch that's happening here in the US. So we're building a little conservatism in because of that. I mean, right now, it's actually looking like it's a positive because you're just seeing so many people in the optical community talk about myopia control for children and how important it is and how it needs to be standard of care.\nSo in my mind, there's no question that long-term, it's a significant positive, and it's a significant positive for MiSight. If I look at just fiscal 2026, could that impact our revenues here in the US market a little bit? It could, right? And if it does, we factor that in. That was our assumption, which is if we get negatively impacted because it's less in the very short term, the growth on MiSight might come down towards the 20% range. But there's a lot of reasons to be more optimistic. I mean, MiSight's launching in Japan. That should be a great market. It's not till Q2, but that's coming.\nMyDay MiSight, as I mentioned, is arguably, I'm going to argue, the most innovative thing going on in the contact lens market, probably the most innovative thing by a wide margin going on in the contact lens market right now. That product launching in Europe, and we're going to hit a few other countries in Asia as we move through the year. So there's a lot of reasons to be excited about MiSight right now. We'll see how the year plays out.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Brett Fishman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nBrett Fishman\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey, guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just had a couple of follow-ups on some of the CVI assumptions for FY26. You were just talking about MiSight, but maybe just drilling into the Japan launch, which I think you mentioned today's plan for Q2. I was hoping you can maybe just touch on how you're thinking about the longer-term opportunity in that region and then just coming back specifically to what's expected in the FY26 guide as a result of that launch?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Well, let me just be clear because the launch is for MiSight in Japan. We obviously have MyDay there now, although, to be fair, it's pretty new, and a lot of the contracts are pretty new. So let me just bifurcate that quickly, right? Because I think that MiSight itself going into Japan for the very first time should be very successful. That's an ophthalmologist market, a product like that that relies on clinical data. And that's the key when it comes to MiSight. I mean, there's other things you could do, but MiSight is the only lens with this really strong clinical data that'll go over really well in a country like Japan. So although it's a Q2 launch, it'll gain traction as we move through the year.\nAnd I would envision that's going to be a really successful product towards the end of 2026 and into 2027. If I think about Japan on a broader basis, we just didn't have the amount of MyDay capacity that we wanted there. We weren't able to do a number of the private label contracts and so forth that we wanted to because we didn't have product. As you remember, Brett, right? We stopped being capacity constrained over the summer. We were able to aggressively go into all of Asia-Pac, including Japan, and start winning the private label contracts. We've won a number of those.\nWe're executing on those now So the assumption is not anything Herculean. It's just that we execute under the contracts that we have and continue to get the product into the marketplace. So relatively straightforward stuff. And that's one of the reasons that we put guidance at three and a half to four and a half in Q1. We did a 3.2 this past quarter. We're not saying that we're going to get a hockey stick immediate ramp-up. We're just saying we're going to continue to get consistent, solid, improving performance.\n\nBrett Fishman\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nAll right. Thank you for that color. And apologies if I misspoke. I meant to say MySite. And then just circling back, one other question. You've talked about some of the distributor channel inventory dynamics in the Americas and was hoping you could just update whether that had any impact on Q4, either negative or if there was some positive reversion, and then if you're still assuming a relatively neutral impact there for FY26. Thank you.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. Yeah. There was really nothing there. At the end of the day, from an inventory perspective, I didn't raise it because there was nothing to talk about.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. I'll just ask two questions here quickly upfront. One is, can you give us just a little bit more detail on the nature of some of the reorganization efforts that you've undertaken here? And then what are some of the actions you're taking to ensure retention? Sometimes with these restructurings, there are unintended consequences of losing the right people you need to execute the business on a go-forward basis. What are you putting in place to ensure you have the right people to achieve the forward strategic objectives?\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nYeah, David, good question. On the reorg, it was pretty much across the board with a heavy focus on kind of back-office support. So we did look at all of our areas, CooperSurgical a little bit more so because we had some integration-related work and some Salesforce consolidation there. But there was a lot of leverage opportunity in our support function areas because of all the IT upgrades that we've done. And frankly, you hear people talk about AI all the time. Well, it is real. When we looked at the AI that we've deployed and our opportunities to leverage it, there were some good opportunities there.\nWhen I look at retention details, I mean, we have fantastic people here. We have great teams of people who are here. The one thing that we're pushing on our organization right now is that we want everyone to embrace AI, continue to embrace it, continue to learn it, make AI your friend, so to speak. I mean, because we made the moves that we needed to make in Q4, and our teams know that. Right now, it's about staying focused on executing, leveraging our growth, making all the appropriate moves. But one of the things that we want to make sure we do here, we always try to do, is first and foremost, we promote from within.\nThat's just the key point. I mean, if I gave you the stats, you would be amazed at how many promotions we have from within. And we're going to continue to do that. We train our people, and we want our people promoted from within. We want everybody here being successful, making more money, and getting ahead because we're a growing organization. We just need to do it intelligently so that we can really, truly leverage this revenue growth on a go-forward basis. And the company right now is so much more efficient than it was and less bureaucratic, that we're in a great spot right now to just do our jobs and execute.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Americas\n\nThanks. And maybe one on CVI, one on strategic review. So, CVI out, maybe a little bit on the private label business, how that trended in the fiscal year, where there are bigger opportunities out there that you either gained or lost. How is that going to set up for 2026, as well as just thinking of the private label trend? And then on strategic, maybe just a recap on historically what are the synergies of having CSI and CVI under one umbrella? And then over the years, have you noticed any dissynergies? In other words, has capital allocation between those two businesses, has that been an issue that could be resolved if they were two separate entities? Thanks again.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nSure. On the private label trends, I would say I would probably point to the new private label contracts that we've won in the US and in Europe. There's some exciting stuff there. I'm not going to go too far into it, but you'll see some of it because it'll be hitting and making itself public in maybe even January, but February, March timeframe. So I think that's going to set us up well, again, for Q3 and Q4 this year to be good quarters for us. So I like the momentum that we have in Asia-Pac in some different areas, but I'm probably equally excited about some of the newer contracts that we've won and that we'll be rolling out.\nOn the strategic synergies, I would say from a capital perspective, we have always invested in CooperVision first and foremost. That's our main driver. We put our dollars there. You've seen that over the years in terms of new manufacturing lines, distribution center upgrades, IT upgrades, and so forth. We've also done a number of deals, as you know, at CooperSurgical as we built that business out. But the last one we did was over a year ago. We did a little tuck-in in August of last year. So it's been a little while there. We've got a great business there. Holly has pulled everything together and has a really much more efficient business today than it was a year or so ago.\nAnd because of that, we've been able to do that work and reallocate our capital, if you will, to share repurchases. And we're going to continue to focus in that area. So I would say that there's been no negative at all from a capital allocation perspective. The synergies that we have are back-office synergies largely. I talked about that and how we're just doing all that stuff more intelligently, but it's still back-office-type synergies. Those businesses still, to a great degree, run separately.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the question-and-answer session. We'd now like to turn the call back over to Al White for closing remarks.\n\nAl White\n\nPresident and CEO, CooperCompanies\n\nGreat. Thank you, Operator, and thank you, everyone. As you could tell, we had an incredible amount of work that was completed in this last quarter. I'm excited that we were able to get on the phone with everyone today and go through those details and present it. We look forward to speaking with everyone over the coming weeks. Thank you. Thank you for your time.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call. In today's discussion, we'll cover our Q3 results, Q4 guidance and early thoughts on fiscal 2026. Starting with the numbers. Q3 consolidated revenues were up 5.7% year-over-year or up 2% organically to $1.06 billion. Margins improved and non-GAAP earnings grew double digits to $1.10, up 15% year-over-year. Free cash flow was strong at $165 million, and we repurchased $52 million of our stock during the quarter. While revenues were lower than expected, I'll speak to that in a minute. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong margins, double-digit earnings growth and robust free cash flow, reflecting the operational excellence that remains central to our growth strategy. .\nThese results reflect disciplined execution and our ability to capitalize on prior investments to drive consistent operating performance across our business. And looking ahead, we expect this type of execution to continue as reflected in our updated earnings guidance and upcoming commentary on free cash flow.\nFor CooperVision, we reported revenues of $718 million for the quarter, reflecting 6.3% reported growth and 2.4% organic growth. These results came in below our expectations, driven primarily by 2 factors. First, Clariti declined globally, led by a noticeable drop in Asia Pac and a slowdown in the Americas and EMEA. As customers continue favoring premium daily lenses, the significant increase in MyDay fitting steps and trial lenses led to a faster-than-expected return to MyDay bidding activity. MyDay delivered double-digit growth this quarter and this bidding activity indicates the future is incredibly bright, this near-term activity meaningfully impacted Clariti orders.\nSecond, we saw greater-than-expected weakness within the pure-play e-commerce segment in Asia Pac, excluding Japan. This mirrored our experience in Q1 in China and was again most pronounced there, although it also affected several smaller regional markets. Despite the top line pressure from this activity, the impact on profitability was minimal as this region's pure-play e-commerce channel has very low margins. Regarding the regional results. Importantly, EMEA delivered a strong quarter, growing 14% or 6% organically, driven by continued strength across key markets. This performance reinforced our #1 position in the region and moved EMEA to being CooperVision's largest revenue region globally.\nAdditionally, early fit set and trial lens activity for MyDay is extremely strong in this region and we expect continued success moving forward. Meanwhile, the Americas grew 2% or 3% organically, navigating the distributor channel inventory dynamic that we discussed on last quarter's earnings call and Clariti softness that APAC grew but declined 5% organically, reflecting the pressure from Clariti, which was down double digits in Japan and China and the weakness in the e-commerce channel. Digging deeper into MyDay, we're encouraged by several positive developments surrounding this flagship product family. First and foremost, we successfully resolved the manufacturing constraints that previously limited our ability to fully compete. With full sales execution capabilities now in place, we're regaining momentum as we accelerate the global rollout of fitting sets and trial lenses. This marks a key turning point in our ability to deliver sustained growth and meet increasing demand across global markets. We've also recently renewed several large contracts and featured MyDay as a growth driver and we won several new private label agreements that offer significant MyDay growth opportunities. These wins are driving fit activity and increasing our confidence in accelerating growth as we move into fiscal '26.\nTurning back to the quarterly details and reporting on an organic basis. Within categories, Torics and multifocals grew 6%, while spares were down 1%. Within modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and Clariti grew 7%, and our silicone hydrogel frequent replacement lenses, Biofinity and Avaira were up 2%. MiSight grew 23%. Starting with MyDay and adding some additional color, MyDay grew double digits this quarter with our most innovative and premium price lenses, works, multifocals and Energys, all posting double-digit growth. In particular, MyDay multifocal grew 20% as this fantastic lens continues to perform extremely well. Importantly, the Volt family of MyDay products has considerable upside as we expand availability and deepen penetration within existing accounts and new customer segments around the world.\nSupporting this, we have considerable activity with fitting sets and trial lenses but also launch activity. This includes MyDay Energous, featuring our premium digital boost technology designed for today's digital lifestyle, which we expect to launch in Europe in early fiscal 2026; MyDay multifocal, which we expect to launch in several major APAC markets soon, along with increasing availability in others; and our MyDay toric parameter expansion, which is actively being rolled out in multiple markets now.\nMoving to Clariti. This was a challenging quarter as customers shifted focus to MyDay. However, looking ahead, we're confident that this high-quality value price lens will regain its footing with success from new launches such as 3 add multifocal which recently entered the U.S. market and grew double digits and from where it is focused on high quality at a reasonable price.\nTurning to our frequent replacement lenses, our bioinstrumentation strong -- fitting activity across its broad portfolio -- while a reduction in channel inventory impacted spears, growth was supported by continuing strength in torics and multifocals. Additionally, our innovative made-to-order products such as the Toric multifocal and extended range spears and torics delivered healthy growth again this quarter. These offerings remain unmatched in the market, offering the broadest range of prescriptions available. Eye care professionals consistently value these products for enabling patients with complex vision needs the ability to wear contact lenses.\nTurning to Myopia management. My side grew nicely, led by another record-setting quarter in EMEA. This performance was driven by increased fitting activity and robust customer engagement initiatives. The new pricing promotions we discussed last quarter are gaining traction and generating encouraging momentum, and we expect this to continue. In the Americas, MiSight delivered mixed results as we rolled out the new promotional structure. But our back-to-school campaign is well underway, and we're seeing positive trends in fits. We're also pleased to share that we just received final regulatory approval for MiSight to launch in Japan, and commercialization is planned for early 2026.\nAdditionally, we're actively preparing for the launch of MyDay MiSight across Europe and select Asia Pac countries in the first half of 2026. We remain well on our way to hitting our objective of a hundred million of MiSight sales this year and are confident that our momentum and upcoming launches will support continued success in fiscal 2026. To conclude our vision, let me share a few thoughts on the contact lens market. Overall market conditions remain healthy and continue to track to the mid-single-digit growth range we discussed on last quarter's earnings call. Consumption trends remained solid and the market continues to see a steady shift towards silicone hydrogel lenses and sustained interest in toric and multifocal products.\nLooking ahead, we expect this level of market performance to continue with the key drivers remaining the ongoing transition to silicone hydrogel dailies, expand adoption of toric and multifocals and to a lesser extent, pricing and growth in wearers.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted quarterly revenues of $342 million, up 4.5% or up 2% organically. Within this, fertility revenues totaled $137 million, growing 6% or up 3% organically, led by strength in genomics and consumables where we gained market share in EMEA. However, we're still seeing signs of pressure on the market with clinics continuing to manage cash conservatively by delaying capital purchases and installations along with ongoing softness in cycles in Asia Pac. Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term outlook for fertility. The underlying fundamentals are strong, supported by trends such as delayed childbirth, increasing access to treatment, rising patient awareness, expanded benefits coverage and continued innovation and technology. It's estimated that 1 in 6 people globally will experience infertility at some point in their lives, underscoring the significance and resilience of this market.\nMoving to office and surgical, retails were at $205 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 1% organically. Growth in Medical Devices was driven by our labor and delivery portfolio of products, which grew double digit. And our specialty surgical device portfolio, which grew upper single digits. And with this portfolio, while not included in organic growth, we continue to see excellent performance from obp Surgical our most recent acquisition, featuring an innovative suite of single-use lighted cordless surgical retractors, which grew 23%. This was offset by a 10% decline in PARAGARD, following a strong start to this fiscal year, driven by advanced purchasing ahead of our price increase and the successful launch of our one-handed inserter.\nNow before turning the call over to Brian, let me share our thoughts on our Q4 revenue expectations. For CooperVision, we expect continued headroom on Clariti. While trends from MyDay are very positive and may present upside, a significant portion of the activity is tied to fits and trial lenses, which typically take a couple of quarters to convert into revenue. As a result, we're guiding to 2% to 4% organic growth to avoid being overly optimistic about the ramp of MyDay. And this guidance also factors in risk with the pure-play e-commerce channel in Asia Pac as well as the potential for any further inventory contraction.\nFor CooperSurgical, we're also guiding to 2% to 4% organic growth as softness in fertility is expected to persist through Q4. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue growth and gain market share. For CooperVision, as confidence is grounded in the strong momentum we're seeing with MyDay, the positive impact we'll receive from upcoming product launches and recent contract wins. We expect to outpace the contact lens market and fitting activity and to gain market share. For CooperSurgical, we expect improvements driven by a rebound in fertility market as the Asia Pac region returns to growing cycles and fertility clinics start investing again. Beyond the top line, we expect operating margin expansion as we lever prior investment activity and a more efficient organization.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to the earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For the third fiscal quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.06 billion, up 5.7% as reported and up 2% organically. Gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 67.3%, driven by continued efficiency gains, mix and positive foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew in line with sales reflecting disciplined cost management.\nWithin this, we delivered targeted SG&A leverage while continuing to invest in R&D, which was up 11%. These R&D investments are consistent with our planned activity around product development at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we continue advancing several exciting development programs and support several regulatory initiatives. Operating income rose 8%, with operating margin expanding to 26.1%. Interest expense was $24.7 million, and the effective tax rate was 13.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 15% based on approximately 200 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $165 million with CapEx of $97 million. Net debt declined to $2.35 billion and our bank defined leverage ratio improved to 1.77x. Finally, we repurchased 724,000 shares of stock for $52.1 million, leaving approximately $164 million ability under our $1 billion board approved repurchase plan.\nMoving to guidance. With just 1 quarter remaining in the fiscal year, I'll focus on our Q4 outlook and then share some preliminary thoughts on fiscal 2026. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue guidance is $1.049 billion to $1.069 billion, reverting 2% to 4% organic growth. CooperVision's revenue is expected to be in the range of $700 million to $713 million, up 2% to 4% organically, and CooperSurgical revenue is expected to be $350 million to $356 million, up 2% to 4% organically. For earnings, we're guiding to non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 to $1.14. And -- this assumes slightly lower year-over-year gross margins, primarily tariffs, offset by a solid operational execution, which we expect will result in better operating margins. Interest expense is expected to be around $21 million, and the effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 14% to 15%. For free cash flow, we expect to generate roughly $100 million in Q4, bringing our full year total to roughly $385 million, which aligns with the -- upper part of our previously communicated guidance range. We'll continue to focus on debt paydown and share purchases with these proceeds.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2026, Al covered revenues, so I'll highlight a few additional items. Starting with tariffs. We've begun implementing mitigation strategies and now expect the impact to be approximately $24 million, lower than previously anticipated. While this will pressure gross margins, we plan to more than offset it through disciplined operating expense management. To support this, we're currently executing several productivity and efficiency initiatives to position ourselves for a strong 2026. These actions correlate with the significant progress we've made implementing IT upgrades and finishing integration activity. With this progress, we've been taking a fresh look at our entire organizational infrastructure to ensure we efficiently leverage future growth.\nAlthough it's too early to quantify any related charges or P&L benefits, we expect them to be meaningful and will provide more detail on our next earnings call. And lastly, regarding free cash flow. With the completion of Coopers' large CapEx investment cycle, which significantly expanded our MyDay capacity, we expect much stronger free cash flow ahead. Operating margins remain healthy, and we're committed to further improvement. But just as important is our focus on converting those margins into free cash flow at a higher rate by executing on working capital initiatives, maximizing returns on investments and maintaining disciplined cost control. As a result of these efforts, we expect to generate approximately $2 billion in free cash flow over the next 3 fiscal years. From a capital deployment perspective, we'll continue investing in growth and innovation while also prioritizing debt reduction and share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions.",

At this time, I like to welcome you to the Q2 2025 The Cooper Company's earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Duncan, VP of Investor Relations and Risk Management. Please go ahead.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Administration\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Cooper Companies Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to revenues, EPS, cash flows, FX and tax rates, tariffs and other financial guidance and expectations strategic and operational initiatives, market conditions and trends and product launches and demand. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or emphasized and are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nEvents that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption Forward-Looking Statements in today's earnings release and are described in our SEC filings including Cooper's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, all of which are available on our website at coopercos.com. Also, as a reminder, the non-GAAP financial information we will provide on this call is provided as a supplement to our GAAP information.

Should you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@coopercos.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to today's fiscal Q2 earnings call. This was another solid quarter with consolidated organic revenue growth of 7%, led by double-digit growth in both our daily silicone hydrogel lenses at CooperVision and our office and surgical portfolio at CooperSurgical. We also continued executing at a high level, delivering operational improvements and OpEx leverage that drove double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth.\nSimilar to other companies, we're dealing with a more complex global operating environment. but we're controlling what we can by executing well, including taking share, delivering leverage, launching products and completing capacity expansion projects. And we'll cover all of that on today's call. Moving to the numbers. Consolidated revenues were $1.002 billion, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% organically. CooperVision reported quarterly revenues of $670 million, up 5% or up 7% organically. CooperSurgical posted quarterly revenues of $333 million, up 8% or up 7% organically. Margins improved nicely, and non-GAAP earnings were $0.96, up 14% year-over-year.\nFor CooperVision and reporting growth rates organically, the Americas grew 8%, EMEA 6% and Asia Pac 5%. Within categories, torics and multifocals grew 7%, and [indiscernible] were up 6%. Within modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti grew 10%, and our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira were up 6%.\nOur myopia management portfolio grew 19% with MiSight up 35%. Turning to products and starting with daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay continued growing double digits with particular strength in torics, multifocals and our innovative Energys offerings. We remain very bullish on this product family as we increase availability in new markets and in new channels to capitalize on opportunities from greater penetration in existing accounts and with new customers. With improved capacity, we're back to being aggressive and that can be seen in a number of areas, including increasing availability of our multifocal and extended toric ranges, new launch activities such as MyDay Energys in Canada, and our upgraded Clarity 1-day spear with Wet Lock technology in Japan and expanded private label discussions. A lot of this activity is tied to increasing bidding sets and trial lenses. So we expect this to accelerate revenue growth starting in fiscal Q4, which is supported by the strong bidding activity we're seeing today.\nTo add a little more color, we just launched MyDay Energys with its innovative digital boost technology in Canada through a series of well-covered events and early feedback is extremely positive. We're receiving significant requests for fitting sets and initial orders are rolling in. Meanwhile, our MyDay toric parameter expansion, which provides eye care practitioners with a widest SKU range by far for a daily toric lens continues progressing well across North America and Europe, and we'll be launching the range expansion in targeted Asia Pac market soon. And lastly, MyDay Multifocals unique advanced 3 ad design paired with its easy fitting system is performing exceptionally well as market availability continues to increase.\nTurning to Clarity. We posted solid results with this high-quality lower-priced lens portfolio, offering a great alternative to MyDay. The redesigned multifocal, which now mirrors MyDay design is a fantastic product and grew double digits this quarter. and I could speak to this product's great handling, comfort and visual acuity as I'm happily wearing them right now reading this script. Moving to frequent replacement lenses. Biofinity continues to strengthen its position as the #1 contact lens in the world, with more people wearing it than any other lens.\nWe're seeing nice growth throughout its full portfolio of market-leading prescription options, including spears, torics, multifocals, extended ranges, made-to-order products and Energous. Biofinity provides eye care practitioners the ability to fit an amazing 99.9% of all patients by far the widest offering of any contact lens family on the market.\nTurning to MiSight. We saw growth in fitting activity to accelerate this quarter with revenue reaching $25 million, up 35%. The A key component to the improved bidding activity is the implementation of a new pricing model initiated following the conclusion of our global pricing review that confirm that the annual wearer cost is not a significant barrier to greater bidding activity. Price certainly matters in training eye care practitioners and educating parents on myopia is important, but the key driver is just getting kids into the lens.\nOnce kids begin wearing MiSight, they love it and with retention rates running around 90%, they stay in it. And when parents verify the benefits of the treatment with their ECPs, they're sold on the technology. With this data, our focus is now heavily on reducing upfront fitting barriers by offering promotions such as an initial 1 to 3 months free. This provides a no-risk opportunity for parents to get comfortable with their children wearing contact lenses and for kids and young adults to get comfortable wearing contacts for the first time.\nWith a broader rollout of this strategy, along with the launch of a large key account private label deal, we're already seeing a nice acceleration in fitting activity in EMEA, and we expect similar success in other markets. This new initial pre fitting period will result in a moderate headwind in Q3, but based on current bidding activity, we expect a considerably stronger Q4. And lastly, we're progressing well with our launch planning for MiSight in Japan, along with MyDay MiSight in EMEA, with both anticipated to occur in early 2026. Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported revenues of $333 million, up 8% or up 7% organically, the quarter was driven by success in our surgical medical devices, labor and delivery portfolio and PARAGARD. Fertility was a little softer than we were expecting, so let me start there.\nFor the quarter, fertility revenues were $127 million, up 3% and up 2% organically. Although supported by positive signs such as double-digit growth in our donor business, and in our witness system consumables that fertility labs use to track activity, overall growth was lower than expected due primarily to market softness. This was largely tied to Asia Pac where fertility cycles continue to decline year-over-year and from fertility clinics managing cash tighter, which is including delaying capital purchases and installments.\nWe expect this softness to continue and to put pressure on market growth and our growth. Having said that, cycle growth in EMEA and the Americas remained solid, which supports the market near term. and we remain incredibly bullish on the long-term prospects for fertility as the underlying growth fundamentals remain intact. -- including women delaying child birth, improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, increasing benefit coverage and improving technology.\nAdditionally, it's estimated that 1 in 6 people worldwide will experience in fertility at some point in their lives. So this is an issue that impacts a lot of people. And as a leader in the space, we will continue delivering innovation, launching new products and services, providing extensive clinical training and expanding geographically. Moving to office and surgical, we posted sales of $206 million, up 13% or up 10% organically.\nAs mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected a strong Q2, and we delivered. Performance was driven by strength in minimally invasive gynecological surgical devices such as our Ally uterine manipulator portfolio and within labor and delivery with products such as [indiscernible] and our cervical ripening balloon. Although not included in organic growth, we also saw considerable strength in OBP Surgical, our most recent acquisition of an innovative suite of single-use lighted cordless surgical retractors, which grew 31%. The PARAGARD grew 18% this quarter, supported primarily by the conclusion of buy-in activity before our May 1 price increase, but also due to continued interest in our new single hand inserter, which we launched earlier this year.\nWith PARAGARD now having grown 15% through the first 6 months of the year, heavily driven by channel fill, we now expect a mid-teens decline in fiscal Q3 before a flattish Q4, resulting in low to mid-single-digit growth for the full fiscal year. To conclude, let me comment on our revenue guidance, which we're tightening and raising at the midpoint. This incorporates our solid Q2 performance and the positive impact from updated currency rates, offset by lower organic growth rates that corresponds to a reduction in our market growth assumptions for contact lenses and fertility.\nFor contact lenses, the industry grew 4% in calendar Q1, so we're reducing growth expectations to the 4% to 6% range for the year, down from 5% to 7%. This new range matches the industry's historical growth range, which we saw for many years pre-COVID. With this change, we're adjusting CooperVision's organic growth expectations to 6% to 7%. To be fair, industry pricing remains solid and consumption remains healthy, so this may prove conservative depending on market conditions and channel inventory. For CooperSurgical, we're reducing market growth expectations for fertility to the low single digits, down from mid- to upper single digits and correspondingly reducing our fertility growth expectations. This is partially offset by the strength we've seen in PARAGARD but still reduces CooperSurgical's consolidated organic growth rate to the 3.5% to 4.5% range. Again, it's important to note, our commercial execution at CooperVision and CooperSurgical remains strong and we're taking share, but against an expectation for softer market growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to cover our financial results in more detail, including our earnings guidance.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to the earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For the second fiscal quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.02 billion, up 6% as reported and up 7% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 68% and up from 67.3%, driven by continuing efficiency gains and mix. Operating expense increased 6%, but declined as a percent of revenue to 43.1% and driven by leverage in several functional areas as prior investment activity continues to yield positive returns. One line item worth highlighting this quarter is R&D where expenses increased 21%. Investments in this area were higher than historical levels for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as development work continues on several exciting projects.\nFor competitive reasons, I won't get into the details, but we're certainly looking forward to launching these new products in future years. Consolidated operating income was up 11%, improving the operating margin to 24.9%.Below operating income, interest expense was $23.5 million, and the effective tax rate was 14.6%.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 14% and with roughly 101 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $18 million with CapEx of $78 million. Net debt increased slightly to $2.47 billion, while our bank-defined leverage ratio reduced to 1.9x. Lastly, we repurchased approximately 537,000 shares of stock back this quarter for roughly $40.6 million. This leaves $215.8 million of availability under our Board approved $1 billion repurchase plan. Moving to fiscal 2025 guidance.\nWe're adjusting our revenue guidance to incorporate Q2 improving FX rates and updated market assumptions. On a consolidated basis, this translates to revenues of roughly $4.11 billion to $4.15 billion, up roughly 5.5% to 6.5% or up 5% to 6% organically. Cover Vision's revenue guidance range is now $2.76 billion to $2.79 billion, up roughly 6% to 7% as reported and up 6% to 7% organically. CooperSurgical's range is $1.35 billion to $1.36 billion, up 5% to 6% as reported or up 3.5% to 4.5% organically.\nRegarding gating for revenues, we expect organic growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 when considering year-over-year comps, the timing around the rollout of products at CooperVision and the gating impact of PARAGARD for CooperSurgical. For earnings, we're raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $4.05 to $4.11, which is growth of roughly 10% to 11.5% year-over-year. For free cash flow, are seasonally low Q2. After a seasonally low Q2, we expect sizable improvements in the back half of the fiscal year and continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million. We'll prioritize debt reduction with these proceeds, but also opportunistically evaluate share repurchases as we did in Q2.\nRegarding tariffs, we expect a negative impact to cost of goods this year of roughly $4 million, which is built into our guidance. It's too early to guide to next fiscal year, but to help level set everyone. If tariffs remain as is, we expect a premitigation negative impact of roughly 3% to fiscal 2026 earnings. Once we have clarity on what the tariffs will be, we will implement mitigation actions to reduce this impact.\nWith respect to the impact of currency and revenues and earnings for fiscal 2025, we now expect a roughly 0.5% headwind to revenues and a roughly 1% headwind to earnings. This is down from roughly 1.5% and and 4% headwind to revenues and EPS, respectively, that was assumed in last quarter's guidance. There are a number of moving parts, but to summarize our updated guidance for earnings.\nWe're increasing the midpoint of guidance by $010, passing along the positive impact of currency and our Q2 beat, offset by tariffs. With that, I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions.",

This was a tremendous year with all-time record revenues of $3.9 billion, including both CooperVision and CooperSurgical reporting record revenues. Within this, Q4 also closed with record revenues and improving margins that drove record non-GAAP quarterly earnings.\nWe've now entered fiscal 2025 with a focus on taking share, driving profitability and executing on our strategic priorities, including increasing the availability of our innovative products, expanding our state-of-the-art manufacturing capacity, optimizing our technology investments, developing and launching new products and investing in our people.\nBefore getting into the details, let me provide some high-level comments on Q4 and fiscal 2025. For Q4, CooperVision had a solid quarter, led by strength in silicone hydrogel dailies and our full suite of torics and multifocals, with the main offset being unexpected softness at the end of the quarter.\nCooperSurgical also had a solid Q4, led by double-digit growth in fertility, offset by a greater decline in PARAGARD than expected. Our Q4 -- or I'm sorry, our P&L improved with prior investment activity driving margin improvements and strong earnings growth.\nMoving into fiscal 2025, we forecast the contact lens market growing 5% to 7% in constant currency with us taking share growing 6.5% to 8.5%. Price should offset inflation, supporting around 1/3 of the growth, with the rest coming from a variety of items, including the ongoing trade-up to dailies growth in torics and multifocals, growth in wearers and, for us, growth in myopia management.\nFor CooperSurgical, we expect organic growth in the mid-single digits with fertility reporting high single-digit growth and the remainder of the business posting low single-digit growth.\nMoving to Q4 details. Consolidated revenues were $1.018 billion, up 10% year-over-year or up 7% organically. CooperVision reported quarterly revenues of $676 million, up 9% or 8% organically, led by strength throughout our market-leading product portfolio. CooperSurgical posted quarterly revenues of $342 million, up 12% or up 5% organically, including fertility taking significant share growing 15% or 13% organically. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 19% to $1.04.\nFor CooperVision, we extended our position as the #1 contact lens company in the world in terms of wearers with our new fit data remaining very healthy. We also gained share on a revenue basis, driven by strength in dailies, torics and multifocals with the Americas growing 6%, EMEA, 11%; and Asia Pac, 7%.\nWithin categories, torics and multifocals grew 9% and spheres grew 7%. Within modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti grew 14% and our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses Biofinity and Avaira grew 8%, and our myopia management business grew 7% with MiSight up 24%.\nTurning to daily silicone hydrogel lenses. We posted another great quarter. MyDay, our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens led the way with strong growth across its full portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals. In particular, MyDay Energys drove growth in the U.S., and we look forward to that trend continuing. MyDay Energys offers an innovative digital boost technology designed specifically for today's digital lifestyle and patients love it.\nMeanwhile, our MyDay Toric parameter expansion across North America and Europe is performing nicely with its market-leading design and industry-leading SKU range. And our MyDay multifocal continues to do well with its unique combination of an advanced design, paired with an easy fitting system that has resulted in very high satisfaction levels including a 98% fit success rate in 2 pairs or less.\nFor all these products, the future remains bright as demand is strong and improving capacity will allow us to expand availability.\nMoving to clariti. We had another solid quarter. These lenses are known for their comfort, easy handling and affordability, and this is resulting in strength in fitting new wearers and upgrading legacy hydrogel wearers. We've also seen momentum with the launch of our upgraded multifocal, which brings our highly successful MyDay multifocal design into the clariti material. This lens is being received well in the U.S., and we'll be launching it around the rest of the world during this year.\nSpeaking from personal experience, both of these multifocals are terrific products. If you're presbyopic and not wearing multifocal contact lenses yet, you're missing out. For me, I didn't need any visual correction until I got into my 50s, and then it hit me. Getting clear crisp vision without reaching for reading glasses has been a game changer. So I'm really happy that we now offer several outstanding multifocals to choose from.\nMoving to our frequent replacement silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity and Avaira had another strong quarter in Q4 and. We continue to see consistent growth from both of these franchises and our innovative manufacturing platforms and market-leading lens designs have created an effective moat, especially with respect to extended ranges and made-to-order products. We expect this performance to continue given our momentum.\nMoving to myopia management. MiSight fitting activity remained strong in the quarter, and October was our second highest revenue month ever, benefiting from back-to-school momentum. That being said, U.S. inventory contraction in October depressed results. Regardless, given the positive fitting trends that we're seeing around the world, we remain comfortable that MiSight will grow around 40% in fiscal 2025, similar to what it did this year.\nRegarding activity, we just concluded national media campaigns in the U.S. and targeted Asia Pacific markets educating parents about myopia and the benefits of proactive treatment. These campaigns were very successful and resulted in a significant number of children being fit in MiSight. We also showcased our global scientific leadership and extensive clinical evidence at the 2024 International Myopia Conference in China and at our annual Asia Pacific myopia management symposium in Korea, partnering with the Korean Association of Pediatric Ophthalmology to deliver insights on gold standard clinical interventions.\nIn the U.S., our myopia collective partnership with the American Optometric Association continues to gain momentum, creating considerable visibility through media interviews, seminars and presentations at conferences.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We reported revenues of $342 million, up 12% or up 5% organically. Within this, fertility posted quarterly revenues of $139 million, up 15% or up 13% organically. Fertility continues to be driven by our leading portfolio of innovative products and services, including consumables, capital equipment, reproductive genetic testing and donor activity, and we're continuing to drive our portfolio forward with innovation.\nThis was highlighted at the recent American Society of Reproductive Medicine Conference, which featured meetings and presentations on our leading genomics capabilities. As the forefront fertility company offering genetic testing build on statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we were excited to present updates to our suite of tests being developed that will detect variations in the DNA at an embryo level, providing further insights to improve the likelihood of having a healthy baby.\nWe also announced a groundbreaking collaboration with ASRM and the Society for Reproductive biologists and technologists for a newly formed clinical embryology learning lab, a first of its kind national training program to support the growing need for more highly trained professionals in the fertility space.\nRegarding the broader fertility industry, the global market continues to expand, driven by strong underlying macro growth trends. These include women delaying childbirth, improving access to treatment increasing patient awareness, increasing benefits coverage and improving technology. The World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 6 people worldwide will experience infertility at some point in their lives due to a variety of health factors. So this is a large industry that offers significant long-term growth potential.\nAs a leader in the space, we remain deeply committed to supporting patients and clinics by driving innovation, improving access to care and addressing the critical global challenges of declining birth rates. Our focus on offering the most advanced solutions is continuing into 2025, where we'll be launching new products and services, providing extensive clinical training, expanding geographically and advancing our R&D efforts.\nMoving to Office and Surgical. We posted sales of $203 million, up 11% year-over-year, driven by the successful strategic acquisitions of certain Cook Medical assets at the beginning of the year and more recently, obp Surgical. Excluding these deals, office and surgical sales were flat organically. Our Medical Devices delivered solid growth led by our minimally invasive gynecological surgical devices such as our Ally uteri manipulator portfolio in our labor and delivery portfolio of products, but this was offset by a 10% decline in PARAGARD, which was weaker than expected as we continue to feel the pressure from other birth control options.\nTo wrap up on CooperSurgical, we had some challenges this year with the Q2 upgrade of our U.S. IT system, but that system is now stable and puts us in a much better position to continue our great growth trajectory. With our diversified portfolio of products and services, we expect solid revenue growth and margin improvements this coming year as we launch new products, leverage prior investment activity and reap the benefits of successful integration work.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, let me say this was a great year for Cooper. We reported record revenues and made significant advancements throughout our organization, investing in capacity expansion, operational improvements and employee development. As we enter fiscal 2025, we're continuing to execute on our long-range strategic objectives and looking forward to reporting another strong year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.018 billion, up 10% as reported and up 7% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 66.9%, up from 66.7% driven primarily by price and efficiency gains, offset by the negative impact of currency. Operating expenses were managed well up only 6.8% and reducing to 41.1% of revenues.\nWe're continuing to see leverage at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as our prior investment activity pays off. Consolidated operating income was up 16.2%, improving the margin to 25.9%, led by strong SG&A leverage. Below operating income, interest expense was $25.6 million, and the effective tax rate was lower than expected at 11.8% due to stock option exercises.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $1.04, with roughly 201 million average shares outstanding. With respect to FX, it was $0.02 negative for the quarter as expected in our Q4 guidance. Free cash flow was $128 million with CapEx of $140 million. Net debt decreased to $2.48 billion with our bank-defined leverage ratio dropping to 1.94x.\nRegarding full year results, we delivered record revenues of $3.9 billion, up 8% and up 8% organically. This included 9% organic revenue growth at CooperVision, which was at the high end of our initial guidance range and 5% for CooperSurgical, which was at the middle of our initial guidance range.\nThis was an excellent year with particular strength in daily silicone hydrogels and fertility. Within the P&L, we continued our momentum, delivering stronger gross margins and leveraging our SG&A investments. Gross margin improved 60 basis points, SG&A improved by 90 basis points and operating margin expanded 130 basis points.\nOperating income grew 19% in constant currency, which exceeded the top end of our initial guidance of 13% to 16%, and EPS grew 15%, which hit the top end of our initial guidance of 12% to 15%. We've talked about our commitment to driving efficiency gains and EPS growth, and we delivered in 2024.\nMoving to fiscal 2025 guidance for CooperVision. The revenue guidance range is $2.733 billion to $2.786 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% organically, and for CooperSurgical, the range is $1.347 billion to $1.372 billion, up 4% to 6% organically.\nOn a consolidated basis, this translates to revenues of $4.08 million to $4.158 billion, up roughly 6% to 8% organically.\nMoving down the P&L. We closed this past fiscal year strong from a production perspective and expect this to translate to improving gross margins, which should help deliver roughly 10% to 12% constant currency operating income growth, which matches our guidance commentary from our last earnings call.\nAssuming no interest rate changes by the Fed, we expect interest expense to be roughly $90 million with improving free cash flow being prioritized to reduce debt. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be slightly over 15% and expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.92 to $4.02.\nFor currency, we're expecting a headwind of roughly 1.5% to revenues and roughly 4% to earnings.\nWith that, let me conclude by saying that we met or exceeded the expectations we set for fiscal 2024, and we'll work hard to do that again in fiscal 2025. We're in a great position from a revenue perspective with market-leading products and improving capacity, and we expect strong operational performance as we remain focused on delivering a more leveraged P&L.\nThis includes gross margin expansion from higher production levels, price increases and cost reduction projects, helping to drive operating margin expansion. Within this, we'll still invest balancing our financial objectives with support for new product launches and expanding our leadership positions in myopia management and fertility.\nAnd now I will hand it back to the operator for questions.",

My name is Pam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter 2024 CooperCompanies Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Duncan, VP of Investor Relations and Risk Management. You may begin.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Administration\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to CooperCompanies Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including revenues, EPS, interest expense, operating income, tax rate, FX and other financial guidance and expectations strategic and operational initiatives, expectations for recent acquisitions, market and regulatory conditions and trends and product launches and demand. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or precise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption forward-looking Statements in today's earnings release and are described in our SEC filings, including Cooper's Form 10-K, and Form 10-Q filings, all of which are available on our website at coopercos.com.\nAlso, as a reminder, the non-GAAP financial information we will provide on this call is provided as a supplement to our GAAP information. We encourage you to consider our results under GAAP as well as non-GAAP and refer to the reconciliations provided in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under quarterly materials.\nShould you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@cooperco.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to today's earnings call. I'd like to start by congratulating our 15,000-plus employees for delivering Cooper's first ever billion-dollar revenue quarter. We couldn't have reached this milestone without the hard work and dedication of our amazing employees. So a big thank you to the entire Cooper team. I'm also proud to announce that both CooperVision and CooperSurgical reported record revenues and that margins improved nicely, driving double-digit earnings growth and record non-GAAP quarterly earnings. This performance highlights the strength of our business as our multiyear growth strategy to become a leader in the daily contact lens space and a leader in the global fertility industry moves into a stage of healthy revenue growth combined with leverage through the P&L. To expand on that, at CooperVision, we've taken our highly successful monthly lens strategy, built on innovation and flexibility and taking it to the daily space, where we're expanding the segment and gaining share.\nAt CooperSurgical, we've expanded our global fertility capabilities while continuing to provide clinics with premium products and services that support every step of the fertility journey. And in both cases, we crafted our portfolios to expand our customers' businesses and improve patient outcomes. We've accomplished this by strategically investing throughout the organization, including installing state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities, implementing technological advancements in packaging and distribution, developing and launching numerous new products, completing significant IT upgrades and providing extensive employee training. This activity is paying off, and I'm proud of our success and excited about what the future holds.\nMoving to the details and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, consolidated quarterly revenues were slightly over $1 billion, up 8% year-over-year. CooperVision posted record quarterly revenues of $676 million, up 10%, led by strength throughout our broad-based product portfolio. And CooperSurgical posted record quarterly revenues of $327 million, up 5%, including fertility returning to double-digit growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 14% to $0.96.\nFor CooperVision, we continue to be the most innovative company in the $10 billion-plus contact lens industry with the broadest portfolio of lenses, the only FDA-approved product for Myopia control, arguably the most active product launch schedule and a fantastic R&D pipeline. This has led to the consistency of our results and is why CooperVision is the #1 contact lens company in the world in terms of wearers.\nFor the third quarter, we once again took share with the Americas growing 13%, EMEA 7% and Asia PAC, 7%. Within categories, torics and multifocals grew 12% and spheres grew 8%. Within modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti grew 13%, and our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses Biofinity and Avaira grew 11% and our Myopia management portfolio posted growth of 29%, with MiSight up 50%. All in, a very nice quarter against a tough comp from last year.\nTurning to products and starting with our high-performing daily portfolio, we continue to see strong growth and healthy momentum with MyDay in every category: spheres, torics and multifocals. In particular, we're seeing extremely strong growth in our most innovative product areas led by MyDay Energys with its DigitalBoost technology with our industry-leading toric range and with our easy-to-fit multifocals, which as everyone knows, is a personal favorite of mine. This product family has been extremely well received by eye care practitioners and customers and we have more upside to our growth as we continue bringing manufacturing capacity online to meet the significant demand. This is particularly true of our market-leading toric where there is considerable new wearer opportunity, along with upgrade potential given the decade-plus success of Biofinity toric, which shares the same design.\nMoving to our mass market daily silicone hydrogel product family clariti. I'm excited to report that we recently launched an upgraded clariti multifocal in the U.S. this past quarter. The lens design matches our MyDay multifocal design, featuring next-generation enhancements that provide better vision and comfort for presbyopic patients as well as an easy [ bidding ] experience for eye care professionals. The clariti family as a whole is known for its comfort, easy handling and affordability and patients appreciate the price point where we're continuing to successfully upgrade legacy hydrogel wearers.\nMoving to frequent replacement silicone hydrogel lenses, both Biofinity and Avaira continue performing exceptionally well. For Biofinity, we're seeing nice growth across the entire portfolio with Biofinity Energys and our made-to-order products such as extended range torics and toric multifocals leading the way. These lenses are made using some of our most innovative manufacturing technologies, and this allows us to provide the widest range of prescriptions in the market, something that is especially important in fitting patients with the most complex vision needs.\nTurning to Myopia management. MiSight posted record quarterly revenues across all regions, and our momentum is strong. We're in the middle of our U.S. back-to-school campaign and early results indicate we'll see a significant increase in consumption through the end of this year. And we've taken the learnings from our successful U.S. programs, and we're running similar programs in other key markets such as Spain, the U.K. and Korea. We're incredibly proud of the number of children's lives were meaningfully impacting through the growing adoption of MiSight and we continue to demonstrate leadership in driving global awareness of Myopia management, working closely with the entire global optical industry to expand usage and establish it as standard of care. In this spirit, in July, at the World Congress of Pediatric Ophthalmology, the CooperVision professional affairs team showcased [ long ] duration of MiSight Science, which now spans 10 years. With multiple additional studies underway in the U.S. and China, MiSight is the most thoroughly research contact lens for children and the clinical data is excellent. We will showcase more data this quarter at the upcoming International Myopia Conference in China as well as in Korea, at our Asia Pacific Myopia management Symposium, which has become a premier annual event for practitioners and researchers across the region.\nTo conclude on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew roughly 7% in calendar Q2 with Cooper continuing to take share up 10%. The market remains very healthy, and that should continue, supported by several long-term macro growth trends. And within this, we're leading with innovation, our broad product portfolio, ongoing product launches, strength in premium products, fast-growing myopia management business and leading new [ fit ] data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted record quarterly revenues of $327 million, up 5%. Within this, fertility sales were $129 million, up 10%. Fertility continues to be a great business for us and the future is bright as we're taking share and expanding our leadership position globally. Our broad portfolio of products and services, including consumables, capital equipment, reproductive genetic testing and donor activity continues to lead the market and we're investing by launching new products, accelerating innovation in R&D, opening new donor sites, providing extensive training in our centers of excellence and expanding geographically. Our focus on delivering the most advanced fertility solutions remains unmatched, and our dedication to improving fertility outcomes for patients remains a guiding principle. Meanwhile, we're seeing strong demand in our focused markets with fertility clinics increasing patient activity, upgrading to new technologies and opening and expanding facilities in several markets.\nRegarding current activity, we just have one of the busiest global fertility events we've ever had at a large European conference in July. Excitement was high for the industry and for our products and services. In particular, there was a lot of excitement around our new culture and transfer media, which just launched in Europe around our new Fast Track genomics testing, which is now launched globally, and around embryo options, our premier cryo management software, which recently launched in targeted European countries.\nRegarding the broader fertility industry, the macro trends supporting growth remain intact, with the World Health Organization highlighting that one in six people globally will be affected by infertility at some point in their lives due to a variety of factors, including women delaying childbirth. As a leader in the space, we remain incredibly committed to advancing the industry by standing in support of patients and clinics and improving access to treatment on a global basis.\nMoving to office and surgical, we posted sales of $198 million, up 2%. Medical Devices grew nicely, led by our minimally evasive gynecological surgical products, including our Ally Uterine manipulator portfolio and our labor and delivery portfolio led by Fetal Pillow, a balloon device used in C-sections to elevate the fetal head and facilitate ease of delivery of the baby. Stem cell storage had a solid quarter and PARAGARD slightly declined as expected after last quarter's strong results. One quick note on PARAGARD, we recently received approval for a new single-handed inserter, which makes placing the IUD easier, and we are now in the process of launching this improvement.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For our third fiscal quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.003 billion, up 8% as reported and up 8% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 66.6%, up from 66.1% last year, driven by continuing efficiency gains and product mix, offset by FX. Operating expenses showed leverage growing slower than sales as efficiency gains from prior investment activities continue to offer positive returns within SG&A. Meanwhile, R&D grew faster than sales as we maintain our R&D activity in several exciting areas, including myopia management and fertility.\nConsolidated operating margin improved nicely, up to 25.5% from 23.9% last year, led by improved gross margins and SG&A leverage. Below operating income, interest expense was $27.1 million, and the effective tax rate was 16.6% higher than expected mainly due to the geographic mix in income. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year with roughly 201 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $118 million with CapEx of $89 million. Net debt decreased to $2.5 billion. Foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings by $0.05 in the quarter, $0.01 better than expected, helping to offset the higher effective tax rate.\nTo summarize fiscal Q3, CooperVision reported double-digit organic revenue growth against last year's tough 13% comp, fertility returned to double-digit growth, and we passed the $1 billion threshold in quarterly revenues for the first time. Gross and operating margins both improved nicely year-over-year, even against currency headwinds. And this resulted in a very strong operational quarter that delivered solid double-digit earnings growth.\nBefore moving to guidance, let me mention two [ tuck-in ] acquisitions. The first is ZyMot, which closed in June. This deal adds a first of its kind patented sperm separation device that helps optimize fertility procedures. The company had roughly $9.5 million in trailing 12-month revenue and the purchase price was approximately $34 million. The second deal is obp Surgical, which closed on August 1. This deal adds both a lighted retractor with an integrated smoke evacuation system and a lighted surgical suction device. The company had trailing 12-month revenues of roughly $14.5 million and a purchase price was approximately $100 million. Both deals are accretive to consolidated revenue growth rates, margins and non-GAAP earnings.\nMoving to fiscal 2024 guidance. We are increasing our consolidated revenue and earnings per share guidance on our third quarter results and expectations for continuing operational strength. For the full fiscal year, this results in consolidated revenues of $3.89 billion to $3.91 billion, up 8% to 8.5% organically. For CooperVision, the guidance range is $2.61 billion to $2.62 billion, up 9% to 9.5% organically. And for CooperSurgical, the range is $1.286 billion to $1.294 billion, up 5.5% to 6.5% organically. We expect interest expense of roughly $109 million which assumes no interest rate changes by the Fed for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be slightly over 14%, assuming no additional discrete items. And we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.64 to $3.67, up 14% to 15%.\nBuilt within this guidance is our fiscal Q4 expectations, including CooperVision growing 8% to 10% organically, CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% organically and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1.01. Regarding fiscal 2025, we'll provide specific guidance in December on our Q4 earnings call, but let me say that we remain focused on delivering strong operational performance and low double-digit constant currency operating income growth.\nTo conclude, let me briefly touch on where we are in our strategic journey from a financial perspective. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've spent considerable time and money positioning our business for higher, long-term sustainable organic revenue growth. This has meant significant investments throughout the company, and we're now seeing that activity pay off with strong revenue growth and leverage through the P&L. We expect this to continue and to lead to improving free cash flow as operating cash flow improves and CapEx moderates.\nWith that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.",

I'm pleased to report record quarterly revenues, great operational progress throughout our organization. CooperVision returned to double-digit revenue growth, driven by our portfolio of leading silicone hydrogel lenses. And CooperSurgical posted a solid quarter despite some unexpected challenges with the system upgrade impacting our U.S. distribution center.\nMargins improved as we leverage prior investment activity, and we delivered excellent earnings growth. As we move forward, increasing our revenue and earnings guidance by incorporating this past quarter and the momentum we're seeing in our markets.\nMoving to the details and reporting all percentages on an organic basis. Consolidated quarterly revenues were a record $943 million, up 8% a year, CooperVision posted record quarterly revenues of $636 million, up 11%, led by our [ daily ] silicone hydrogel portfolio, and CooperSurgical posted revenues of $307 million, up 4%. Margins improved and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.85.\nFor CooperVision, the Americas grew 10%, EMEA 14% and Asia Pac, 7%. All 3 regions were led by our innovative product portfolios, market-leading flexibility and strength in key accounts. Within categories, torics and multifocals combined to grow 12% and spheres were up 9%.\nWithin modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti, grew 18%, and our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses Biofinity Avaira combined to grow 10%. And our myopia management portfolio was up 17%, with MiSight growing 39%. All in, a very nice quarter with strength around the world and throughout our focused product portfolio.\nTurning to product details and starting with our high-growth daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, we add another [ penta ] order with MyDay leading the way, delivering outstanding results. MyDay is growing in every market and every category. With particular success in our innovative toric and multifocal products. Our ongoing toric parameter expansion launch across North America and Europe is enabling eye care professionals or ECP to fit more wearers in our market-leading design and industry-leading SKU range, which is by far the widest toric range in the daily market.\nIn MyDay multifocal is a unique combination of an advanced multifocal design paired with an easy fitting system has resulted in very high satisfaction levels, including a 98% fit success rate in [ two ] or less. We continue to receive very positive feedback on fantastic lens, and I continue to count myself as an ecstatic wearer of what it is without a doubt the best multifocal contact lens in the market.\nWe've also seen success with our MyDay spears, especially with our Energys product, which is showing very strong growth.\nEnergys is driven by its innovative digital boost technology designed specifically for today's digital lifestyle and this meaningful technological improvement is important to contact lens wearers and the ECPs. Given the strong performance of business in the U.S., we're excited to launch it in additional markets in the near future.\nMoving to clariti. Our other complete family of silicone hydrogel daily lenses also remains a driver. ECPs love this product for its comfort, easy handed and affordability, which makes it an especially good choice for new wearers. It continues to be a driver of expanding our daily wearer base with noted success in updating legacy hydrogel wearers.\nOutside of dailies, demand for Biofinity and Avaira remains very healthy. The Biofinity portfolio has continued expanding beyond the traditional ranges of spheres, torics and multifocals, into expanded ranges made-to-order lenses, toward multifocals and Energys and now provides ECPs the ability to fit an amazing 99.9% of patient prescriptions. This is an incredible manufacturing accomplishment and a fantastic benefit to those patients who require the most complex types of vision correction. This is a true differentiator in any office and one of the reasons Biofinity remains so successful. With new state-of-the-art manufacturing lines now in service, we'll be expanding availability of these lenses in markets and launching in new markets in the near future.\nMoving to myopia management. MiSight continues to gain traction, powered by healthy demand. Asia Pac posted a record quarter, EMEA was strong and the Americas reported a record month in April. Although revenues were negatively impacted by a reduction in channel inventory during the quarter. Our back-to-school promotional campaigns are starting soon and we expect robust results based on the success we saw here. So we're expecting strong results in the back half of this year.\nIn the meantime, we're marking a milestone anniversary from MiSight with 2024 being the 10-year anniversary of the Pivotal MiSight 1-day clinical trial which led to MiSight becoming the first and still the only FDA-approved optical intervention for myopia control. This study remains a gold standard in clinical trial study design and duration from myopia control in the longest running study of contact lens wear in children.\nCooperVision's commitment to establishing myopia control standard of care continues and can be seen via 2 important initiatives launched this quarter. First, as part of the continuation of our exclusive partnership with the World Council of Optometry, we've launched a digital myopia management navigator tool available to ECPs around the world. This interactive toolkit provides practical tips and resources to help offices at myopia management into their practices.\nSecond, CooperVision and the American Optometric Association have partnered on a groundbreaking initiative the myopia collective to rally U.S. ECPs to adopt myopia management as the standard of care for their pediatric patients. The program is currently recruiting 51 ECPs representing each state plus a District of Columbia who will work proactively with the AOA and CooperVision to advocate for community and policy change.\nTo conclude our contact lenses, the market grew roughly 5% in calendar Q1, with Cooper taking share 7%. We continue to expect a robust market moving forward, driven by several positive long-term macro growth trends. And within this, we expect to remain a leader with our innovation, robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, strength in premium products, fast-growing myopia management business and leading new fit data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted quarterly revenues of $307 million, up 4%. Demand was strong, but a systems upgrade cost shipping interruptions in our U.S. distribution center for our medical device and fertility products. We were largely able to overcome this strength in PARAGARD, but not entirely. Having said that, we've made a lot of progress, and we're comfortable we'll manage the backlog and reach our full year organic revenue guidance range, which remains unchanged.\nImplementing IT infrastructure upgrades can certainly be challenging, but this type of work is critical to our long-term success as it supports efficient growth, creates a better customer experience and makes internal operations more effective with improved real-time data.\nMoving to fertility. Sales were $124 million, up 4%. We continue seeing strong demand around the world with our leading products and services continuing to position us well with fertility clinics as they open new facilities, upgrade existing locations and look for opportunities to improve outcomes and optimize our operations. We're also investing for the future, opening new donor sites, providing extensive training in our centers of excellence, expanding geographically and accelerating innovation. Our focus on investing and delivering the most innovative and advanced solutions to fertility clinics and patients remains unmatched. This includes the first and only European approval for a uniquely formulated one-step media.\nThis specialized culture and transfer media reinforces Embryo and [ no embryo ] communication for improved embryo development, sustained implementation and pregnancy.\nSimilar to the advances we're making in fertility-based genetic testing, the science is complex, but the goal is straightforward, providing innovative, market-leading technologies to improve the journey to parenthood. Developing and delivering these types of innovations is why we're a leader in this space, and it's our commitment to continue this type of work.\nRegarding the broader fertility industry, this dynamic market is supported by several positive macro growth trends, including in delaying childbirth, increasing patient awareness, greater benefits coverage, technology advancements and improving access to treatment. The World Health Organization highlights that 1 in 6 people will be affected by infertility at some point in their lives. So this is an issue that impacts a lot of people, and we'll do so in the future. As a leader in this space, we remain incredibly committed to advancing the industry by delivering innovative products, standing in support to patients and clinics and improving access to treatment on a global basis.\nMoving to [ CooperSurgical ] we posted sales of $183 million, up 4% with medical devices declining 6% due to the previously mentioned shipping challenges. Stem cell storage was up 5% and PARAGARD up 22%. Within Medical Devices, demand was healthy, driven by our minimally invasive gynecological surgical products led by our ally uterine manipulator portfolio. And our labor and delivery portfolio is now arguably the most comprehensive obstetrics portfolio of medical devices, ensuring the safety of mothers and babies and demand remains strong.\nOur stem cell business had a solid quarter and PARAGARD outperformed expectations with the benefit of stocking related to a mid-single-digit price increase. Destocking will naturally offset itself largely in fiscal Q3.\nTo conclude on CooperSurgical, with our expand obstetrics portfolio of products and services, we can now update our impact to the global community and say that roughly every 30 seconds, somewhere around the world, a baby is born using CooperSurgical products. We're making a difference in people's lives, and that may business very special.\nTo wrap up, let me add that we just released our latest ESG report, which highlights our efforts around environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility and strong corporate governance. It's on our website and what reading when you have a chance. We are passionate about sustainability, and I'm thankful to our employees around the world for their commitment to doing things the right way.\nSo with that, let me say thank you to our 15,000-plus employees for their continuing hard work and dedication as they drive our success. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. For the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $943 million, up 7% as reported and up 8% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 67.3% up from 67.1% last year, driven by continuing efficiency gains and price.\nOperating expenses grew in line with revenues, with SG&A showing leverage and R&D growing faster. Regarding R&D, we've increased our investment activity in several exciting areas to ensure we remain a technological leader by continuing to launch some of the most innovative products in our markets -- more to come on this as products are developed and launched. Consolidated operating margin improved to 23.8%, up slightly from 23.7% last year led by the gross margin improvement. Below operating income, interest expense was $27.5 million, and the effective tax rate was 13.5% due to the positive impact of stock option exercises.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $0.85, up 10% year-over-year with roughly 201 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $37 million with CapEx of $74 million. Net debt decreased to $2.6 billion.\nForeign exchange negatively impacted earnings by $0.07 in the quarter. which was $0.01 worse than we were expecting at the time of our last guidance, even with a positive offset from our hedging program.\nTo summarize fiscal Q2, this was a solid quarter. CooperVision returned to double-digit growth. CooperSurgical made tremendous progress implementing system upgrades and margins improved year-over-year even against currency headwinds. Tax and FX offset one another, and we delivered a strong bottom line.\nMoving to fiscal 2024 guidance. We're increasing expectations for revenues and earnings by incorporating our Q2 performance and the momentum we're seeing as we enter the back half of the fiscal year. This results in full [ unit ] revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.9 billion, up 7.5% to 8.5% organically.\nFor CooperVision, we're increasing our guidance to $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion, up 8.5% to 9.5% organically driven by healthy demand and improving capacity. For CooperSurgical, our organic revenue guidance is unchanged at 5% to 7% weight to $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion. Interest expense is also unchanged at roughly $108 million, which assumes no interest rate changes for the remainder of our fiscal year.\nAnd for tax, we're forecasting a full year effective tax rate [ of ] 14% , assuming no additional discrete items. Given all this, we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of 3-point -- sorry, $3.54 to $3.60, up 11% to 13%.\nRegarding currency, the impact from FX is roughly $0.02 worse than the back half of the year compared to last quarter's guidance, but we expect our hurdle that with stronger operational performance.\nLastly, on quarterly gating, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS to be higher in Q4 than Q3. This is primarily the result of a lower gross margin in Q3 associated with higher cost contact lens inventory rolling through the P&L in Q3. Currency is also slightly more negative in Q3 than in Q4.\nIn summary on guidance, we're raising CooperVision's growth rate to reflect improving capacity, in CooperSurgical's growth unchanged and raising our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.04 on the bottom and $0.02 on the top. Even against the negative impact of an additional $0.02 from FX in the back half of the year.\nTo conclude, we remain focused on delivering strong revenue growth and consistent operational performance. Our capacity is improving. We're leveraging prior investment activity, and we're deploying capital with a focus on organic investments, which offer the highest return for investment dollars. Our momentum remains very healthy, and that's reflected in our updated guidance.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",

White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies 2024 Fiscal First Quarter Conference Call. We're off to an outstanding start this year, posting all-time record quarterly revenues of $932 million. CooperVision started the year on a solid note, growing nicely around the world and CooperSurgical achieved record quarterly revenues with our fertility business posting its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Our earnings were strong and our momentum is excellent with capacity expansion progressing well and demand remaining very healthy. .\nMoving to the quarterly numbers and reporting all percentages on an organic basis. Consolidated revenues were $932 million, up 8% year-over-year. CooperVision posted revenues of $622 million, up 7%, led by strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio. And CooperSurgical posted revenues of $310 million, up 8%, led by another great quarter in our fertility business. Margins improved, and profits were solid with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85, remembering that we just completed a 4-for-1 stock split last week.\nFor CooperVision, the Americas grew 6%, EMEA 10%, and Asia Pac, 7%. All 3 regions reported success with our innovative product portfolios, market-leading flexibility and growth in key accounts.\nWithin modalities, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti, grew 14%, and our silicone hydrogel monthly and 2-week lenses, Biofinity and Avaira Vitality grew 6%.\nWe're continuing to see outsized demand, especially for MyDay, but our capacity is improving, and this is reflected in our higher revenue guidance that we'll cover shortly.\nTurning to products. We're seeing very strong growth in demand with MyDay. Starting with MyDay multifocal, our momentum is truly fantastic. The unique combination of an advanced multifocal design, paired with an easy fitting system is resulting in 98% of patients being fit in 2 pairs or less. And patient feedback continues to be outstanding, including my own.\nAs many of you know, I wear these lenses and they're amazing. Whether I'm looking at a screen for long hours, driving home, eating out or doing anything else, my vision is crisp and my eyes feel great. I'm comfortable saying these are the best multifocals in the market and our outstanding growth and strong demand certainly supports that.\nMoving to MyDay toric. This lens is also performing extremely well. The rollout of our parameter expansion across North America and Europe has been a tremendous success, and we look forward to increasing availability as capacity improves. Demand for the product continues to be driven by our market-leading toric design, which mirrors Biofinity's design and our industry-leading SKU range, which is by far the widest toric range in the daily market.\nIn our MyDay sphere portfolio, MyDay Energys is approaching its 1-year anniversary in the U.S. market and is continuing to generate great results. Its innovative digital Boost technology delivers optics designed for today's lifestyle, where, on average, people spend more than 7 hours per day on screens and wearers love it.\nMeanwhile, our premium MyDay sphere is also posting great results. To wrap up on MyDay, our team has done a phenomenal job supplying existing customers while keeping expectations in check on new product launches and geographic expansion. I'm now happy to report that our success expanding capacity is easing some of those constraints and allowing us to be more active moving forward.\nMoving to Clariti. With its full family of silicone hydrogel spheres, torics and multifocals, we're continuing to do well. The comfort, ease of handling and price positioning have led Clariti to be a lens of choice for many new wearers. Outside of dailies, demand for Biofinity remains strong, led by torics and multifocals.\nIt's worth highlighting our Biofinity toward multifocal, which is growing very nicely as eye care practitioners continue making it their primary lens for patients experiencing more complex vision needs balancing presbyopia with differing levels of astigmatism. We'll be expanding availability of this lens in existing markets and launching a new market soon, so we're excited about that. Avaira also had a nice quarter led by torics.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $29 million, up 19%, with MiSight up 51%. This was another excellent quarter for MiSight, powered by growth across all regions with particular strength in EMEA where we posted record quarterly sales. Worldwide, we're continuing to see momentum in key accounts, high retention rates and a nice halo effect. We're also launching new digital tools and programs to streamline the fitting process, making it easier and quicker.\nMiSight remains the first and only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control and it's backed by extensive clinical data and real-world results. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia become standard of care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopia in children.\nOutside of MiSight, our Ortho K lenses declined 10% due to weakness in China. And on SightGlass, you may have heard from our JV partner, Essilor Luxottica that the FDA recently granted SightGlass Spectacles Breakthrough Device designation. We're excited about this update, and we'll continue working closely with the FDA in hopes of obtaining approval in the second half of 2025.\nFinally, as we look to expand myopia care to all children, we've launched a pilot program in the U.S. called [ GenerationSight ] in collaboration with 3 top optometry schools, the Illinois College of Optometry, the New England College of Optometry and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. To provide myopia care to underserved children.\nThis program engages local public school systems to drive awareness and treatment of myopia by providing free eye exams and free MiSight. It also helps optometry students get real-world pediatric experience while increasing their clinical capabilities as they develop into the next generation of professional leaders.\nAs a leader in the myopia management space, we're certainly proud of programs like this that are making a difference with kids in our communities.\nTo finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew 9% in calendar 2023, with CooperVision taking share growing 11%. We expect 2024 to be another strong year, supported by the long-term macro growth trend and more people needing vision correction. It's estimated that 50% of the global population will have myopia by the year 2050, up from roughly 34% today. When you combine this with the ongoing shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher-value products and higher pricing, we expect many years of solid growth for the industry.\nWithin this, we expect to remain a leader with our innovation, robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, strength in premium toric and multifocal products, fast-growing myopia management business and leading new fit data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted record quarterly revenues of $310 million, up 8% organically. Fertility sales were $119 million, up 11%, which is our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. This success was driven by our outstanding team and market-leading products and services within consumables, capital equipment and reproductive genetic testing. We're also investing for the future, opening new donor sites, providing extensive training in our centers of excellence, expanding geographically and accelerating innovation.\nWe believe our focus on investing and delivering the most innovative and advanced solutions to fertility clinics and patients remains unmatched. This includes our recent launch of Witness IQ, a cloud-based digital platform that further enhances the benefits of the witness system to track activity, reduce errors and improve efficiencies in fertility labs. And we remain at the forefront of fertility-based genetic testing.\nCooperSurgical was an early adopter of artificial intelligence to identify the best embryos to transfer during an IVF cycle and we're now further advancing our leadership position with the launch of primary template directed amplification, a new approach to DNA amplification for embryo biopsy samples. As an enhancement to the existing pre-implementation genetic testing process, this technology better identifies genetic anomalies in a faster, more accurate manner. This is the first major advancement to DNA amplification and embryo since 2009 and will help drive better patient outcomes.\nDelivering these types of innovations is why we're a leader in this space, and it's our commitment to continue this type of work.\nFor the global fertility market, the trends supporting significant long-term growth remain intact, including women delaying childbirth, increasing patient awareness, greater benefits coverage technology advancements that improve success rates and broadly speaking, improving access to treatment. The World Health Organization highlights that 1 in 6 people globally will be affected by infertility at some point in their lives. So this is an issue that impacts a lot of people and will continue to do so in the future. As part of this, we remain incredibly committed to the fertility industry and will always stand in support of patients and clinics. Access to fertility treatment is incredibly important for so many people, and Cooper will continue to advocate for increased accessibility and the advancement of human reproductive rights on a global basis.\nMoving to office and surgical, we posted sales of $191 million, up 6% organically with Medical Devices growing 6%, stem cell storage up 4% and PARAGARD, up 7%. Within our Medical Device business, we reported strength in our labor and delivery portfolio, including the Cook products that we acquired last November that grew 13%. We also reported strength in our minimally invasive gynecological surgery products, which include market-leading disposables and innovative capital such as our Ally Uterine manipulator portfolio. Our stem cell business had a solid quarter and PARAGARD outperformed expectations with outstanding execution around a mid-single-digit price increase.\nTo conclude our CooperSurgical, we take great pride in being able to say that every minute, somewhere around the world, a baby is born using CooperSurgical products. We're making a difference in people's lives, and that's a big part of what makes this business special for us.\nBefore turning the call over to Brian, let me say that in addition to our strong operational performance, our efforts around environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility and other important areas within our business are also advancing well. So thank you to our 15,000-plus employees around the world for their hard work and dedication as they drive our success.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. .\nFor the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $932 million, up 9% as reported and up 8% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 67.3%, up from 65.7% last year, driven by efficiency gains and price at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Operating expenses grew 8%, improving to 43% of revenues as we continued leveraging prior SG&A investment activity. Consolidated operating margin improved to 24.4%, up from 22.6% led by the gross margin improvement and SG&A leverage.\nBelow operating income, interest expense was $28.6 million, and the effective tax rate was lower than expected at 13.3% due to stock option exercises. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.85, up 18% with roughly 200 million average shares outstanding.\nThe impact from FX was $0.03 negative year-over-year for the quarter. Free cash flow was $5 million with CapEx of $118 million. As discussed on prior calls, free cash flow continues to be impacted as we progress with our capacity expansion projects. Net debt increased to $2.6 billion due to the closing -- due to closing the [indiscernible] Medical acquisition in November.\nTo summarize fiscal Q1, this was an excellent start to the year. CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted strong results, and we expect this to continue. We remain focused on exceptional operational execution, combined with high return investment activities such as increasing capacity and expanding geographically, and we're confident this will drive significant long-term shareholder value.\nMoving to fiscal 2024 guidance. We're increasing expectations for revenues and earnings by incorporating our Q1B, better future operational performance and slightly lower interest expense. This results in full year consolidated revenues of $3.85 billion to $3.9 billion, up 7% to 8% organically.\nFor CooperVision, we expect strong results to be driven by healthy demand and improving capacity. This translates to an increase in our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 9% and which equates to $2.57 billion to $2.6 billion.\nFor CooperSurgical, we expect continuing strength in fertility along with solid performance in our office and surgical product category. This translates to an increase in our organic revenue guidance to 5% to 7%, which equates to $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion.\nWe're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to an expected range of $3.50 to $3.58, up 9% to 12% year-over-year. or 15% to 17% in constant currency. This guidance assumes roughly $108 million of interest expense, which includes no interest rate changes by the Fed during the remainder of our fiscal year.\nFor tax, we're expecting a full year effective tax rate of roughly 14.5%, by incorporating Q1 and assuming no additional discrete items.\nFor currency, rates are very similar to our initial annual guidance. Thus, the impact to Q2 to Q4 is essentially unchanged. And the full year impact is still roughly a negative 1% to revenues and a negative 5% to earnings.\nTo wrap up, we had an excellent fiscal Q1 and the business is trending well. We're leveraging our prior investment activity, advancing our production efforts and investing to drive continued growth. Demand and momentum are strong, and that's reflected in our updated guidance.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",

And now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies 2023 Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Year-end Conference Call. .\nThis was a fantastic year for Cooper as we finished with all-time record revenues of almost $3.6 billion. And we closed the year on a really positive note with CooperVision posting its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth and CooperSurgical posting record quarterly revenues driven by our fertility business posting its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Truly tremendous accomplishments by phenomenal teams.\nWe've now entered fiscal 2024 with a lot of excitement and focus on executing on our long-range strategic objectives, including gaining market share, driving profitability launching innovative products and services and maintaining our fantastic Cooper culture.\nMoving to the quarterly numbers. Consolidated revenues were $927 million, up 9% organically year-over-year. CooperVision posted revenues of $623 million, up 11% organically, and CooperSurgical posted revenues of $304 million, up 7% organically.\nCooperVision's growth was led by strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, and CooperSurgical's growth was led by a very strong quarter in our fertility business. Margins improved, and profits were solid with non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.47, up 26%.\nFor CooperVision, and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, revenue growth was strong and diversified. The Americas grew 12%, EMEA grew 9% and Asia PAC grew 10% and with all 3 regions having success with our innovative products, market-leading flexibility and growth in key accounts.\nWithin categories, Torics grew 15%. Multifocals grew 18%, single-use spear grew 7% and non-single-use for other grew 4%. Within modalities, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 19%, and our silicone hydrogel monthly and 2-week lens as Biofinity and Avaira Vitality grew 8%.\nTurning to products and starting with our high-growth daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, we continue to outperform expectations with MyDay. We just passed the 2-year anniversary of the MyDay multifocal launch and the pace of growth on this product remains outstanding. The unique combination of an advanced multifocal design, paired with an easy fitting system has resulted in very high satisfaction levels, including a 98% fit success rate in 2 pairs or less. This makes it a win for the doctor and the patient, and it shows in our results and momentum.\nFrom a personal perspective, as I shared last quarter, I now wear MyDay multifocals, and I continue to be amazed at how easy the lenses are to insert and remove and how fantastic my distance and near vision are. And I put these lenses in as soon as I wake up, and I don't take them out until bed time. I may be biased, but I truly believe these are the best multifocal lenses on the market, and our sales growth certainly supports that.\nMoving to MyDay toric, Demand remains very strong, following the rollout of our parameter expansion across North America and Europe. This success is due to the product's market-leading toric design, which mirrors Biofinity's design and our industry-leading SKU range.\nIn MyDay Energys, our most recent launch continues to impress eye care practitioners and patients with its innovative digital boost technology designed specifically for today's digital lifestyle. The lenses deliver fantastic comfort and sales are exceeding our expectations. And I'm proud to say that MyDay Energys was recently voted the most innovative product of 2023 by U.S. eye care practitioners an awesome accomplishment and a great recognition for our team.\nWith the success of these MyDay products, we certainly look forward to rolling them out in additional markets around the world as soon as capacity allows.\nAnd while MyDay continues to be our key growth driver in the daily silicone segment, we're continuing to have success with Clarity, which offers a full family of spheres, torics and multifocals at a great price point. The initial comfort, excellent handling and price positioning have led clarity to be a lens of choice for new wearers.\nOutside of dailies, demand for our Biofinity family of products remains healthy, led by torics and multifocals. And I'm excited to announce what we're launching our highly successful Biofinity toric multifocal to several new markets in the coming year in response to extremely strong demand.\nAvaira also had a nice quarter led by torics. Moving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $35 million, up 41% with MiSight up 46%. This was another excellent quarter for MiSight, powered by growth in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pac was flat due to challenges in China.\nAs we enter fiscal 2024, we're expecting excellent growth with the positive trends in the Americas and EMEA continuing and Asia Pac returning to growth as the region has hurdled past stocking orders and is already showing improving trends.\nAdditionally, we're continuing to see high retention rates, growing momentum in key accounts and a nice halo effect on our other products. All this adds up to over 250,000 children around the world wearing MiSight and momentum being very strong.\nMiSight remains the first and only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control and it's backed by extensive clinical data. This is a crucial differentiator as the proactive management of myopia become standard of care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopia in children, along with reducing the risk of long-term eye health problems associated with myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment and macular degeneration.\nMeanwhile, our Ortho-K franchise had a nice rebound quarter, growing 37% year-over-year.\nTo finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew roughly 7% in calendar Q3 and with CooperVision taking share growing 10%. We expect the market to remain healthy, growing 5% to 7% this coming year, supported by the long-term macro growth trend of more people needing vision correction. It's estimated that 50% of the global population will have myopia by the year 2050, up from roughly 34% today.\nThis is driven by kids spending more time in doors and the related greater use of digital screens, among other factors. When you combine this with the ongoing shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher-value products and higher pricing we expect many years of solid growth for the industry. Within this, we expect to remain a leader with our innovation, robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, strength in premium toric and multifocal products, our fast-growing myopia management business and our leading New Fit Data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted record revenues of $304 million, up 7% organically. This included fertility sales of $121 million, up 15% organically, which was our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth.\nWithin this, we saw share gains around the world and throughout our portfolio, driven by our market-leading products and services, including consumables, capital equipment and reproductive genetic testing. We also continued investing in geographic expansion, key accounts and R&D.\nWe're entering fiscal '24 as one of the fastest-growing and most innovative fertility companies in the world. We're developing and launching new products, opening new donor sites, providing extensive training through our centers of excellence, expanding in new and existing geographies, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success, given our great team, diverse portfolio and global momentum.\nFor the broader fertility market, the macro growth trends remain intact, starting with women delaying childbirth. Age is a key factor in contributing to the need for fertility assistance and the median age of women's first birth in the U.S. and within several other developed countries is roughly 30 years old and moving higher.\nOther growth drivers include improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, increasing fertility benefits coverage and technology improvements to address both male and female and fertility challenges.\nThe World Health Organization data highlights that 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility at some point in their lives. And given that 1/3 of the underlying cause of infertility is women, 1/3 is men and 1/3 is a combination of the two or unknown. This is an issue that impacts a lot of people and will continue to do so in the future.\nMoving to office and Surgical. We posted sales of $183 million, up 3% organically with medical devices growing 3% against a very challenging comp. Within this part of our business, we recently closed the acquisition of several highly strategic products from Cook Medical. Given the strength of our medical device team and the success we're having in the labor and delivery space, where several of these acquired products reside. This will be a great deal for us, and I look forward to reporting future results on these products.\nStem cell storage posted solid growth of 6% and PARAGARD was flat as higher pricing offset decline in unit sales.\nTo conclude our CooperSurgical, we take great pride being able to say that every minute somewhere around the world, a baby is born using CooperSurgical products. We're making a difference in people's lives, and that's part of what makes this business really special for us.\nMoving to fiscal 2024. Let me provide comments on revenue guidance, and Brian will cover the rest of the P&L. We expect CooperVision to post strong results and are guiding to 7% to 9% organic revenue growth for the year.\nThe main limiter to this growth is capacity challenges from new wearer demand, especially for MyDay. We expect these capacity constraints to pressure revenues in fiscal Q1, resulting in growth of around 7% for the quarter. We are actively bringing additional capacity online, though and expect to report high single-digit to double-digit growth as we move through the year.\nFor CooperSurgical, we're guiding to full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 6% and which includes another year of strength in Fertility, low to mid-single-digit growth in medical devices and stem cell storage and flat to slightly down in PARAGARD due to declining volumes.\nTo conclude, let me say this was a great year for Cooper, and we've entered fiscal 2024 with great momentum. But none of this is possible without the incredible hard work and dedication of our employees. So a big thank you to the entire global Cooper team for another incredible year.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. .\nFor the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $927 million, up 9% as reported and up 9% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 66.7%, up from 65% last year, driven by better operational performance at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, along with favorable currency.\nOperating expenses grew 8%, improving to 42.3% of revenues as we saw leverage from prior investment activity. Consolidated operating margin improved to 24.4%, up from 22.2% led by the strong gross margins and leverage from our operating expenses.\nBelow operating income, interest expense was $26.4 million and the effective tax rate was slightly higher than guidance at 12.8%.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $3.47, with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. With respect to FX it was $0.25 positive year-over-year for the quarter, which was $0.02 worse than expected in our Q4 guidance.\nFree cash flow was $29 million with CapEx of $145 million. Net debt decreased to $2.45 billion.\nFor the full year 2023, we reported record revenues of $3.6 billion, up 9% or up 10% organically and non-GAAP EPS of $12.81. Within this, consolidated operating income grew 11% on a constant currency basis.\nTo provide additional color on our fourth quarter results. First, we had solid execution with an emphasis on delivering stronger gross margins and leveraging our operating expenses. This focus on delivering a more leveraged P&L as continuing in fiscal 2024.\nSecond, we completed a significant amount of infrastructure and integration activity this quarter. This puts us in an excellent position to deliver success moving forward, including ramping up capacity and implementing continuous improvement projects.\nAnd lastly, we finished the majority of the integration of our specialty lens care unit into our core CooperVision business. This is a great move from a commercial and efficiency perspective, but it did result in a noncash intangible asset impairment charge associated with the discontinuation of certain products, which is a large part of our non-GAAP adjustments this quarter.\nBefore moving to guidance, let me mention that we closed the acquisition of Select Cook Medical assets on November 1. The purchase price was $300 million with $200 million paid at closing and the remaining $100 million to be paid in $250 million annual installments.\nThe acquired assets generated approximately $56 million in trailing 12-month revenue as of September 30, 2023, and we expect growth of 5% to 7% in constant currency this year.\nExcluding onetime charges and yield-related amortization, the transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP gross and operating margins and accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.20 in fiscal 2024.\nMoving to guidance, we're guiding to fiscal 2024 consolidated revenues of $3.81 billion to $3.88 billion, up 6% to 8% organically. With CooperVision revenues of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion, up 7% to 9% organically. And CooperSurgical revenues of $1.26 billion to $1.28 billion up 4% to 6% organically.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $13.60 to $14. This assumes roughly $110 million of interest expense which includes the debt from the assets acquired from Cook Medical and no interest rate changes by the Fed during our fiscal year.\nFor tax, we're still expecting a roughly 15% effective tax rate, excluding any discrete items, such as stock option exercises.\nFor currency, we're using roughly current rates which results in a year-over-year FX headwind of roughly 1% to revenues and roughly 5% to earnings.\nAnd lastly, the EPS range corresponds to roughly 10% to 13% constant currency OI growth, excluding Cook or 13% to 16% with the Cook acquisition accretion.\nTo wrap up, as announced in our earnings release, our Board has approved a 4-for-1 stock split with an effective date of February 16, 2024. This is in response to many years of strength in our stock and our desire to adjust the price to make ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\nAnd lastly, we made the decision to stop paying our de minimis semiannual dividend.\nWith that, let me conclude by saying fiscal 2023 was a record year for Cooper, and we're well positioned to deliver solid growth and leverage in fiscal 2024.\nAnd now I'll hand it back to the operator for questions",

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 Cooper Companies Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations and Risk Management. You may begin your conference.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Administration\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.

Should you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@cooperco.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Company's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. Demand for our products and services remains very healthy, and we solidly exceeded revenue expectations, posting record quarterly revenues of $930 million, driven by strong sustainable organic growth. CooperVision reported record quarterly revenues in its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth and CooperSurgical reported record quarterly revenues with its fertility business posting its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. Our teams are delivering impressive results, our momentum is strong, and we're executing well on our strategic growth initiatives. Moving to the numbers. Consolidated revenues were $930 million, up 12% organically. CooperVision posted revenues of $630 million, up 13% organically and CooperSurgical posted revenues of $300 million, up 9% organically. Exceeding $600 million in quarterly revenues was the first for CooperVision and exceeding $300 million was the first for CooperSurgical.\nCooperVision's growth was driven by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolios and CooperSurgical's growth was led by our fertility business. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.35. For the quarter and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, CooperVision's revenue growth was strong and diversified. By geography, the Americas grew 12%, EMEA grew 13% and Asia Pac grew 16%. Throughout the world, we're leading with innovation tied to new products, expanded product ranges, market-leading flexibility and growth in key accounts. Within categories, Speers grew 9%, Torics grew 16% and multifocals grew 19%. Within modalities, Daily Silicone Hydrogel lenses accelerated and grew 23% with MyDay leading the way. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio with MyDay and Clarity available on a wide range of Speers towards and multifocal. And lastly, our silicone hydrogel monthly and 2-week lenses Biofinity and Avera vitality grew a healthy 8%.\nTurning to products and starting with our high-growth daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, we're 6 months into the U.S. launch of our highly innovative MyDay Energous lens and the ramp is progressing exceptionally well. This premium lens taps into a fundamental wear or need catering to the demands of today's lifestyle by incorporating digit -- digital boost technology to alleviate the impacts of digital eye strain. It's a big success with eye care practitioners and wearers alike, our sales momentum is very strong. We're also seeing high demand for MyDay Toric as we continue rolling out our parameter expansion across North America and Europe. This demand is being driven by its market-leading Toric design, which mirrors Biofinity's design and our industry-leading SKU range, which is by far the widest Toric range in the daily market. this broad range, eye care practitioners are capitalizing on the opportunity to offer their 2-week and monthly Toric wearers the option to enjoy the freedom of wearing a daily Toric lens.\nAnd last but not least, MyDay Multifocal continues to take considerable share around the world, reestablishing CooperVision's position in the premium multifocal market segment. We continue to hear from eye care practitioners how easy the lens is to fit and how fantastic the visual acuity is. And I can speak to this personally as I was recently fit in contact lenses for the very first time in well with MyDay multifocal. The process was remarkably fast and easy, and these lenses are truly amazing. To conclude on MyDay, this technologically superior family of products continues to deliver high growth and our momentum is fantastic. And lastly, within the daily segment, our Clarity family of lenses continues to perform well by offering a high-quality product at a mass market price point. It was especially nice to see strength with Clarity in several international markets, including an acceleration of sales in Asia Pac. Outside of dailies, demand for Biofinity remains strong, led by Toric, multifocals and our custom offerings and Avera vitality had a solid quarter led by Toric.\nMoving to IOP Management. We posted revenues of $30 million, up 30%, with MiSight up 53%. MiSight accelerated this quarter, posting its best growth for the year, even with China declining year-over-year due to tough comps against the stocking order last year. Meanwhile, our Ortho K franchise had a difficult quarter tied to portfolio realignment and weakness in China. Fiscal Q4 started off well, though, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of $120 million to $130 million, albeit probably at the lower end, as strength in MiSight like won't offset Ortho K [ softness ]. Regarding MiSight, we're seeing improving fitting trends around the world, driven by key accounts, higher-volume pediatric optometry practices and from the successful integration of the sales process from our specialty lens unit into our regular sales channel. We're also continuing to see very high retention rates, including roughly 90% in the U.S. along with an ongoing positive halo effect with MiSight practitioners accelerating their use of other CooperVision lenses. We also recently confirmed that Aetna is now covering MiSight under medical plans to opt in to LEMS coverage which represents 70% to 80% of Aetna plans.\nThis all is Kaiser, who started covering MiSight through Vision Care plans roughly a year ago. This type of coverage is exciting, but it's still very early in the process, and we have a lot of work to do to ensure eye care practitioners and families understand what it means. To conclude on MiSight, as a reminder, it's the first and only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control and the product is backed by extensive clinical data. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia become standard of care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopian children along with reducing the risk of long-term eye health problems associated with myopia such as cataracts, retinal detachment and macular degeneration. To finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew roughly 8% in calendar Q2 with CooperVision taking share at 11%. We expect the market to remain healthy, supported by the long-term macro growth trend and more people needing vision correction. It's estimated that 50% of the global population will have myopia or nearsightedness by the year 2050, up from roughly 34% today. This is driven by kids spending less time outdoors and the related greater use of digital screen indoors, among other factors.\nWhen you combine this with the ongoing shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher value such as Torics and multifocals and higher pricing, we expect many years growth for the industry. Within this, we expect CooperVision to remain a leader with its market-leading innovation, robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading new fit data. Moving to CooperSurgical. We posted 9% organic revenue growth, including fertility sales of $122 million, up 11% organically for its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Our fertility business continues to perform at a very high level, and the future is bright with strong macro trends supporting the industry's growth. For the quarter, we once again realized success from our diverse offerings within consumables, capital equipment, reproductive genetic testing and donor activity. And regionally, we posted solid growth in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pac. This was accomplished while investing in multiple areas, including geographic expansion, key accounts, infrastructure build-out and R&D.\nWe continue to launch new products and roll out existing products and new geographies, and we're clearly leading the way is one of the most innovative fertility companies in the world. In summary, we're in a fantastic place, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success given our great team, diverse portfolio and global momentum. Regarding the broader fertility market, the macro trends that are driving global growth remains strong, and we're continuing to see a lot of exciting activity in the space. The industry has multiple growth drivers, starting with women delaying childbirth. Age is a key factor in contributing to the need for fertility assistance and the median age of a women's first birth in the U.S. within several other developed countries is roughly 30 years old and continuing to move higher. Other growth drivers include improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, increasing fertility benefits coverage and technology improvements for both male and female and fertility challenges.\nThe World Health Organization recently released updated data showing that 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility at some point in their lives. And given that 1/3 of the underlying cause of infertility is women, 1/3 is men and 1/3 is a combination of the 2 or unknown. This is an issue that impacts a lot of people and will continue to do so in the future. Moving to office and surgical, which includes medical devices, PARAGARD and stem cell storage, we posted sales of $178 million, up 8% organically. Within this, Medical Devices reported strong growth of 11%, driven by positive procedure volume and strength in several core products. In particular, our surgical and labor and delivery products performed well. Meanwhile, PARAGARD grew 7% as we saw some bounce back from last quarter's softness, and our stem cell storage business grew 4%, in line with expectations. To conclude on CooperSurgical, it's with great pride that we say that every minute, somewhere around the world, a baby is born using CooperSurgical products. Our business makes a difference in people's lives, and we love that. We're also operating in several markets that have excellent long-term growth characteristics, such as fertility. So we feel good about where we're positioned and what the future holds.\nBrian, let me make some high-level comments on our strategies. The last couple of years has shown the strength of our business with revenue growth accelerating as we exited the COVID pandemic. This is a result of a multiyear effort concentrated on investing to drive sustainable organic growth, and we've done this while completing several successful strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue with this growth strategy moving forward. And embedded within this is investing in our people, improving our infrastructure, expanding areas such as sales and marketing, investing in R&D. With that, let me conclude by saying how proud I am of our teams. None of this is possible without the dedication and incredible hard work of our employees. Now let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Third quarter consolidated revenues were $930 million, up 10% as reported or up 12% organically. Consolidated gross margin was flat year-over-year at 66.1% with positive currency and product mix being offset by a certain period costs. Operating expenses grew 9%, but improved to 42.2% of revenues as we started seeing leverage in parts of the P&L from prior investment activity. Consolidated operating margin improved to 23.9%, up from 23.4% last year, led by leveraging our operating expenses. Below operating income, interest expense was $26.8 million, and the effective tax rate was better than expected at 12.6% due to discrete items. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.35, with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. With respect to FX, it was $0.07 worse than initially expected, mainly due to losses below the operating income line associated with certain unhedged currencies.\nThis FX loss offset a better tax rate. That color to the P&L. Revenues exceeded expectations, and we're seeing leverage in certain OpEx line items. However, gross margins were below expectations due to softer-than-expected margins at CooperSurgical, and this negatively impacted earnings by roughly $0.08. This is primarily attributable to period costs largely in our fertility business. As an example, we are significantly ramping up our donor sperm and egg businesses that we acquired with Gener8. This activity is moving ahead faster than expected, which is great news. But it created unexpectedly large period charges. We also had some inventory write-offs during the quarter. Some of this activity continued into August, but we expect these matters to be resolved during fiscal Q4 and not impact fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, regarding OpEx leverage, I'm pleased to report that we've completed several important upgrades this year, which will benefit us moving forward. This includes several large infrastructure improvements at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, including a major IT implementation at our primary European warehouse at CooperVision.\nAdditionally, we essentially doubled the size of our U.S. distribution facility and added several upgraded packaging and labeling lines. And that facility is now online. This activity puts us in an excellent position to leverage the P&L moving forward. Back to the quarter, free cash flow was $52 million with CapEx of $91 million. Net debt decreased to $2.46 billion. Before meeting the guidance, let me add that after quarter end, we paid a $45 million termination fee for ending the contemplated acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business. This did not impact Q3 and it won't impact Q4 as P&L, but it will negatively impact free cash flow for Q4 as this is treated as a reduction in operating cash flow. Moving to guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to incorporate our strong fiscal Q3 results and the strength we're seeing as we enter fiscal Q4. For EPS, we're holding our range unchanged at the midpoint, which reconfirms roughly 11% constant currency operating income growth for the full year.\nSpecific to fiscal Q4, the consolidated revenue guidance range is $912 million to $929 million, up 7% to 9% organically and CooperSurgical's revenues of $299 million to $305 million up 5% to 7% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.57 based on a roughly 12% effective tax rate which offsets the softer gross margin in CooperSurgical and recent FX weakness led by the yen. For fiscal 2024, it's too early to provide detailed guidance, but let me give some direction. At a high level, our focus remains on executing on our long-term growth objectives, which include expanding capacity and enhancing our supply chain capability. Within this, we will work to leverage the P&L with a focus on delivering low double-digit constant currency operating income growth next year. Outside of that, we expect a roughly 15% effective tax rate, subject to discrete items such as the positive impact of stock option exercises. In conclusion, this was another solid quarter. Our organic growth was strong and our momentum is very healthy in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator.",

White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. This was another strong quarter with CooperVision and CooperSurgical both outperforming expectations. For CooperVision, we reported record quarterly revenues and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. For CooperSurgical, we reported record quarterly revenues and our fertility business reported its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth and earnings exceeded expectations. .\nOur teams are delivering impressive consistent growth, and we're seeing nice momentum. So we remain very positive about the future. Moving to the numbers. Consolidated revenue reached a record quarterly high of $877 million. CooperVision posted revenues of $589 million, up 10% organically, and CooperSurgical posted revenues of $288 million, up 5% organically. CooperVision's growth continues to be led by our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios, and CooperSurgical's growth was led by our fertility and OB/GYN medical device portfolios. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.8. For the quarter and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, CooperVision's revenue Growth was strong and diversified. By geography, the Americas grew 6%, EMEA grew 7% and Asia Pac grew 19%.\nResults were driven by new product launches, expanded product ranges, market-leading flexibility and growth in key accounts. Within categories, torics and multifocals remain especially healthy with both posting growth of 15%. Within modalities, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 17% with especially strong performance from [indiscernible]. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio with MyDay and clariti available on a wide range of Sears, torics and multifocals. And lastly, our silicone hydrogel monthly and 2-week lenses, Biofinity and Avera vitality reported growth of 5%. Turning to products. The U.S. rollout of our latest innovative offering, MyDay Energous is going exceptionally well. This premium lens caters to the demands of today's lifestyles by incorporating digital Boost technology to alleviate the impacts of digital eye strain. Interestingly, we've been receiving a lot of positive feedback that patients in their 20s and 30s really like this lens which is great news as the original Biofinity Energys has been more heavily used by patients in their 40s. Given almost all of us are spending considerably more time on screens, which reduces blinking and causes eyes to dry out and become uncomfortable it's not surprising that wearers of all ages are appreciating the digital boost in their MyDay Energies.\nMeanwhile, MyDay multifocal sales remain robust, and we're seeing great momentum in new geographies as the lens becomes more readily available in EMEA and Asia Pac. I'm happy to report these launches or perceived better than expected with feedback from customers and practitioners remaining very positive. Our MyDay toric parameter expansion rollout in North America is also continuing successfully and our recent launch in EMEA is ahead of schedule. Given the success of this product, we'll be increasing availability throughout EMEA, and we're looking forward to launching in Asia Pac in the near future. With almost 4,000 SKUs, MyDay Toric has set the industry standard with the widest daily toric range in the market by a wide margin.\nWith this broad range, it's providing many 2-week and monthly toric wearers the option to enjoy the freedom of wearing a daily contact lens for the first time in their lives. To conclude at MyDay, this technologically superior product family is performing exceptionally well and momentum is strong. And lastly, within the daily segment, our Clarity family of lenses continues to perform well by offering a high-quality option at a mass market price point. Outside of dailies, demand for Biofinity remains healthy, led by torics, multifocals and extended range offerings. We still have some capacity challenges but with new production continuing to come online, we remain in good shape to meet ongoing demand.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $30 million, up 36%, with MiSight up 49%. This slightly exceeded expectations and keeps us well on track to reach our goal of $120 million to $130 million this year. MySideNOrCOc sales were strong around the world, except China, where we didn't see a rebound until late in the quarter. Regarding MiSight specifically, we're seeing improving performance as we increase availability in key accounts, target practices with higher levels of pediatric patient flow and integrate the sales process into our regular sales channel. All this bodes well for my site, but also for our other products as there's a nice halo effect when my site practitioners accelerating their use of other CooperVision lenses.\nIt's important to remember that MiSight is the first and only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control and the product is backed by extensive clinical data. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia become standard of care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopia in children along with reducing the risk of long-term eye health problems associated with myopia, such as cataracts, retinal detachment and macular degeneration. To finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew 12% in calendar Q1, with CooperVision growing faster at 14%.\nwe expect the markets to remain healthy, supported by the macro growth trend and more people needing vision correction. It's estimated that 50% of the global population will have myopia or nearsightedness by the year 2050, up from roughly 34% today. This is driven by the increasing use of digital screens, among other factors. And when you combine this with the ongoing shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher-value products such as torque to multifocals and higher pricing, we expect many years of solid growth for the industry. Within this, we expect CooperVision to remain a leader with its robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading new fit data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. This was another strong quarter. Our fertility business posted sales of $125 million, up 11% organically for its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Success was seen throughout the product portfolio as the team executed exceptionally well with our diverse offerings within consumables, capital equipment, reproductive genetic testing and donor activity. Regionally, the Americas and EMEA continue to lead growth and the future is bright as we have solid momentum in both regions. Asia Pac is also performing well, and we're excited about the potential of that region. With the uncertainty of the Cook transaction, we do have work to do in that region to build out our footprint, and we'll do that. In this life, we're currently doing targeted investment activity while also exploring ways we can advance efforts more quickly.\nOverall, though, we're well positioned to maintain success given our strong team, diverse portfolio and global momentum. Regarding the broader fertility market, we compete in a segment that's now over $2 billion in annual sales, and we expect strong growth for many years to come. This industry is unique in that it has multiple growth drivers, starting with women delaying childbirth. The average age of a woman's first birth in the U.S. and within several other developed countries now stands at 30 years old, and Asia is a key factor contributing to the need for fertility assistance. Other growth drivers include improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, increasing fertility benefits coverage and technology improvements for both male and female and fertility challenges. The World Health Organization just released updated data showing that the prevalence of infertility affects more people than we thought, with approximately 1 in 6 people having experienced infertility at some stage in their lives. So the macro trends clearly support this industry's growth. Moving to office and surgical products, which includes OB/Gyn Medical Devices, stem cell storage and PARAGARD. We posted sales of $163 million, up 1% organically. Within this, OB/GYN Medical Devices reported excellent results growing 11%, driven by positive trends in patient activity and strength in several core products. In particular, our labor and delivery group continue performing really well. Our stem cell storage business grew 3%, in line with expectations. Our current educational campaign should start in Christy Tegan highlights the importance of preserving newborn stem cells and we're really happy with the positive feedback, and we're looking forward to that effort gaining more traction. Meanwhile, PARAGARD declined 15%, primarily due to buy-in activity from the price increase in Q1. Our IUD revenues remain a challenge, and we're continuing to not expect any unit growth in PARAGARD this year. So any growth we do see will be driven by price. To conclude on CooperSurgical, it's with great pride that we say that every minute somewhere around the world, a baby is born using CooperSurgical products. Our business makes a difference in people's lives, and we love that. We're also operating in several markets that have fantastic long-term sustainable growth characteristics, such as fertility. So we feel good about where we're positioned and what the future holds. Before turning the call over to Brian, let me summarize by saying this quarter really highlights the stability and consistency of our businesses. CooperVision posted its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and CooperSurgical's fertility business posted its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and both businesses reported record quarterly revenue. Our momentum is strong.\nOur investments are yielding solid returns and our management team is fully engaged in executing at a high level. And lastly, I hope everyone has had a chance to read our recent ESG report, which highlights a lot of accomplishments. Advancing our ESG efforts is an important part of Cooper's culture, and I'm proud of the success we've had and excited about what we'll be accomplishing in the future.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Second quarter consolidated revenues were $877 million, up 6% as reported or up 8% organically. Consolidated gross margin was up 40 basis points to 67.1% driven by currency improvements.\nOperating expenses grew 9% and to 43.5% of revenues. The consolidated operating margin was in line with expectations at 23.7%. This was down from 24.5% last year, primarily due to commercial investments and distribution. Below operating income, interest expense was $26 million, and the effective tax rate was 13.9%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.08, with roughly 49.8 million average shares outstanding. To summarize the P&L this quarter, revenues came in ahead of expectations, while margins met expectations. The net impact from nonoperational items, such as FX, interest expense and taxes was slightly negative against our initial expectations. Overall, we exceeded our consolidated EPS expectations by roughly $0.06 and we'll pass along that in guidance. Free cash flow was $51 million, including CapEx of $74 million. Net debt decreased to $2.51 billion. And during this last quarter, we fixed the interest rate on an additional $300 million of debt. So we're now -- we now have $1.3 billion fixed, going out roughly 2 to 4 years.\nRegarding 2023 guidance, we're increasing expectations for revenues and earnings by incorporating our Q2 revenue and earnings beats. This results in consolidated revenues of $3.1 million to $3.57 billion, up 7% to 9% organically, with CooperVision revenues of $2.37 billion to $2.4 billion, up 8% to 10% organically, and CooperSurgical revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion, up 5% to 7% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.66 and to $12.96. Interest expense is expected to be around $110 million, assuming another 25 basis point rate increase by the Fed this month, and the effective tax rate is forecasted to be slightly below 14.5% when incorporating Q2. Within this, we're continuing to invest in our businesses to support long-term growth objectives.\nDemand across both businesses remain strong and our long-term growth trends are very positive. Before concluding, let me add that we took a $45 million charge this quarter for the breakage fee associated with the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business. We now believe it's probable that this transaction as originally contemplated does not close. We are still working on the deal, though, and we'll provide updates as we have more information.\nIn conclusion, this was another strong quarter, we're very happy with the consistency of our businesses, and we have great momentum. We're closely monitoring expenses and we'll continue to do so, but we're also investing to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth. We're taking guidance up again and remain positive, we'll execute at a high level, delivering strong operating results through the back half of this year and into next year.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Kim Duncan, VP, Investor Relations and Risk Management. Please go ahead.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Administration\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Cooper Companies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions or trends, product launches, operational initiatives, regulatory submissions and closing or integration of any acquisitions or their anticipated benefits. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and are described in our SEC filings, including Cooper's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, all of which are available on our website at coopercos.com.\nAlso, as a reminder, the non-GAAP financial information we will provide on this call is provided as a supplement to our GAAP information. We encourage you to consider our results under GAAP as well as non-GAAP and refer to the reconciliations provided in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under quarterly results. Should you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@cooperco.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. We started this year on a positive note with strong operational performances at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. For CooperVision, we reported record quarterly revenues in our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. For CooperSurgical, we posted strong results, including fertility reporting its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. Earnings exceeded expectations, driven by the strength in revenues and investment activities yielding operational efficiencies faster than expected.\nThis is exactly how we wanted to start the year, and we'll continue balancing investment activity with prudent operational management to deliver solid results. Moving to the numbers. Consolidated quarterly revenue reached an all-time high of $858 million. CooperVision posted record quarterly revenues of $581 million, up 10% organically and CooperSurgical posted revenues of $277 million, up 10% organically. CooperVision's growth was led by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, and myopia management and CooperSurgical's growth was broad-based with strength in many areas. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.90.\nFor CooperVision in Q1 and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, revenue growth was strong and diversified. The Americas grew 9%, EMEA grew 12% and Asia Pac grew 10%. This performance was driven by new product launches, expanded product ranges, market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings and growth in key accounts. Regarding product details, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 17% with especially strong growth from MyDay.\nDaily silicone hydrogel lenses continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio with MyDay and clariti available on a wide range of spheres, torics and multifocals. Our silicone hydrogel monthly and 2-week lenses, Biofinity and Avaira Vitality reported another solid quarter of 9% growth.\nTurning to product news. We remain extremely busy. Our MyDay multifocal rollout is going incredibly well, and we expect strong growth to continue as the product becomes more readily available in EMEA and Asia Pac. Feedback from customers and practitioners remains outstanding, and we continue taking share. Our MyDay toric parameter expansion rollout in the U.S. and Canada is also going well, and we'll be launching the expanded range in EMEA this quarter. With over 4,000 SKUs, our MyDay toric has the widest daily toric range in the market by a wide margin and it's opening the door to many 2-week and monthly toric wearers to enjoy the freedom of wearing a daily contact lens for the first time ever.\nAll this activity is having a positive halo impact on the MyDay sphere, which is also performing well. And lastly, on our MyDay franchise, I'm excited to announce we started the national rollout of MyDay Energys in the U.S. This premium lens uses the same innovative digital boost technology as Biofinity Energys to alleviate the impacts of digital eye strain. Studies show that adults are now spending more than 7 hours a day on screens, resulting in eyes feeling strained and uncomfortable. Energys with its boost technology is the perfect solution to address this digital eye fatigue and our survey work clearly shows that practitioners and customers are excited to get this technology in a daily offering.\nAll this MyDay activity is exciting, and we remain dedicated to developing and rolling out technologically superior MyDay products for many years to come. Lastly, within the daily segment, clariti is performing well. Its mass market price point is allowing eye care practitioners to continue utilizing the clariti franchise as a great way to bring wearers into the daily silicone hydrogel space.\nMoving outside of dailies. Demand for Biofinity remains strong, led by our torics, multifocal and extended range offerings. We continue to be capacity constrained in some of these areas, especially around our extremely high demand made-to-order products such as extended range torics and toric multifocal but the continued ramp up of our manufacturing facilities is allowing us to address the significant demand. And lastly, we had a nice quarter with Avaira Vitality, especially in Asia Pac.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $25 million, up 32% with MiSight up 50%. This was in line with expectations and keeps us on track to reach our goal of $120 million to $130 million in sales this year. Regarding MiSight, we're expanding availability in numerous key accounts, actively launching our expanded parameter range and making great progress on numerous R&D efforts.\nWe're seeing increased fitting activity as optical offices become more comfortable with their myopia control practice management, and we're continuing to see a positive halo effect with our MiSight customers accelerating their use of other CooperVision lenses. MiSight is the first and only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control and the product is backed by extensive clinical data. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia become standard of care within the eye care community to help reduce the risk of long-time eye health problems associated with myopia such as cataracts, retinal detachment and macular degeneration.\nFinally, I want to mention the great work that the CooperVision team has done in our environmental sustainability efforts. In January, we announced that our net plastic neutrality initiative reached a major milestone with the prevention of the equivalent of more than 100 million plastic bottles from entering the oceans. This program has been incredibly well received by contact lens wearers and eye care professionals, and we're extremely proud of its success.\nTo finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market grew roughly 9% in calendar 2022, with CooperVision growing faster at 11%, and we expect 2023 to be another robust year supported by the macro growth trend of more people needing vision correction. It's estimated that 50% of the global population will have myopia or nearsightedness by the year 2050, up from roughly 34% today. This is driven by a variety of factors, including greater screen time. And when combined with the ongoing to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher-value products such as torics and multifocals and higher pricing, we expect many years of strong growth for the industry, and we expect to remain a leader with our robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading New Fit Data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. This was an excellent start to the fiscal year. Our fertility business posted sales of $112 million, up 10% organically for its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. Success was broad-based with strong results throughout the product portfolio and around the world. The global fertility market remains a very exciting space with strong macro trends supporting significant long-term growth potential.\nThere are multiple drivers in this industry, beginning with women delaying childbirth. The average age of women's first birth in the U.S. and within several other developed countries now stands at a record 30 years old, an age is a key factor contributing to the need for fertility assistance. Other growth drivers include improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, improved product offerings, increasing fertility benefit coverage and technology improvements for both male and female and fertility challenges.\nIt's estimated that roughly 50% of reproductive age couples have fertility challenges and that over 750,000 babies are born annually through fertility assisted measures and these numbers are growing. Within the broader fertility space, we compete in a market that's roughly $2 billion in annual sales, and we forecast growth of 5% to 10% for many years to come. Our positioning is excellent with the broadest portfolio in the industry, a solid commercial footprint and strength in key accounts. We're also investing in our team and in our product portfolio, which includes consumables, capital equipment and reproductive genetic testing, and we're expanding geographically. Demand remains very strong, especially within our key accounts, so we need to keep building infrastructure by investing in our people and delivering the products and services required in this high-growth market.\nMoving to office and surgical products, which includes OB-GYN medical devices, PARAGARD and stem cell storage, we posted sales of $165 million, up 10% organically. Within this, OB-GYN medical devices grew 10% with strength seen in several of our core products. This team is doing a great job managing strong demand with ongoing supply chain challenges, and I'm proud of the hard work and success we're having. PARAGARD grew 11%, driven by buy-in activity from a price increase of roughly 8% implemented at the end of the quarter. We'll see a natural offset to this in Q2, but it's nice to get the year off to a good start.\nAnd lastly, our stem cell storage business grew 5% organically. We've owned this business for just over a year now, and I'm happy to report that we're seeing improving traction. The synergies we expected as part of the transaction are occurring and the business is in a good position. As part of our focus in this space and ongoing investment activity, and I'm happy to report we recently kicked off an exciting marketing campaign with Chrissy Teigen leading our latest educational efforts around the importance of preserving newborn stem cells. The early reaction to this social media campaign has been very positive and are excited to see how it progresses and delivers value through the year.\nTo conclude our CooperSurgical. I want to mention something that I'm really proud of.\nWorldwide, every minute, a baby is now born using CooperSurgical products. I just love that, and it truly shows what a fantastic and meaningful business CooperSurgical is. So to summarize, let me again say this is exactly how we wanted to start this fiscal year. Our operational performance was excellent. Our momentum is strong. and we're executing on our investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. And with that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. First quarter consolidated revenues were $858 million, up 9% as reported or up 10% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 65.7%, down 1.2% from last year, primarily due to currency and product mix.\nOperating expenses grew 11% to 43.1% of revenues, and consolidated operating margin was 22.6%, down from 24.6% last year, primarily due to currency. To add some color, I'm happy to report that many of the freight and distribution challenges that we experienced in Q4 that continued into Q1 have now been resolved. And these financial results exceeded our expectations due to the strength at the end of the quarter. Below operating income, interest expense was $26 million, and our effective tax rate was 14.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.90, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.\nFX negatively impacted earnings by roughly $0.30 year-over-year, which is $0.05 better than we were forecasting when we provided guidance in December. Free cash flow was $84 million, including CapEx of $83 million. CapEx continues to be heavily driven by capacity expansion, and we expect that to continue. Net debt decreased by $48 million to $2.56 billion.\nTurning to fiscal 2023 guidance. We're increasing expectations for revenues and earnings by incorporating our Q1 beat, improved operational performance and slightly better FX rates. This results in consolidated revenues of $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion, up 7% to 9% organically, with CooperVision revenues of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion, up 8% to 9% organically and CooperSurgical revenues of $1.14 billion to $1.17 billion, up 5% to 7% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.60 to $12.90.\nWithin this, interest expense is expected to be slightly higher at around $110 million, but our effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 14.5%, offsetting this. For interest expense, we're assuming 3 future Fed moves, a 25-basis point rate increase this month, another 25 basis point increase in May and then an additional 25 basis point increase in June. For currency using updated rates, we are now expecting a slightly more positive impact to the P&L, which we're fully passing along. And from an operational perspective, we're raising expectations tied to actions we've taken to drive efficiencies.\nTo summarize this, we're raising the midpoint of our earnings guidance by $0.30 with $0.20 coming from our Q1 beat, $0.05 coming from operational improvements that we're expecting in Q2 to Q4 and $0.05 for better FX in Q2 to Q4. The increase in our revenue guidance is similar, incorporating the Q1 beat, stronger expected performance in Q2 to Q4 and better FX.\nRegarding the operational improvements, in addition to addressing the supply chain challenges from Q4, we've taken further steps to improve our operational efficiencies. One such example would be the consolidation of our specialty lens business into our core lens franchise. Over the past several years, CooperVision has created the world's most comprehensive specialty contact lens portfolio comprised of products such as leading Ortho-K and scleral lenses to treat myopia and more severe cases of a regular accordion. This part of our business has grown nicely, and it's now time to consolidate it into our core operations and leverage our infrastructure.\nIn the meantime, we're continuing to invest in our product launches, manufacturing footprint, and distribution capabilities to support our long-term growth objectives. Demand is strong and long-term growth trends are very positive, so we're investing prudently but accordingly. There are a lot of positives to take away from this activity. Our capabilities are expanding. Our operations are becoming more efficient, and the numbers are looking better.\nThat being said, we remain cautious regarding recession risk and continued inefficiencies tied to supply chain challenges and have incorporated that into our expectations. To conclude on guidance, note that it does not include the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business. We're exploring all options related to this transaction in order to obtain regulatory approval, including the potential sale of certain Cook assets. And we expect the transaction to be resolved by August of this year.\nAnd with that, I will hand it back to the operator for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations and Risk Management. Please go ahead, Ms. Duncan.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVP of IR & Risk Management, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies' fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions or trends, product launches, operational initiatives, regulatory submissions and closing or integration of any acquisitions or their anticipated benefits.

Should you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@cooperco.com.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to AL for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Non-Independent Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Year-end Conference Call. We finished this year with CooperVision reporting its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth; and CooperSurgical, posting an eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth within its fertility business. Demand for our products and services was very strong in Q4, and we're seeing that continue into fiscal 2023. I'm extremely proud of the dedication of our Cooper employees and the hard work it took to post another year of record revenues in fiscal 2022, and I look forward to another record-setting year in fiscal 2023.\nMoving to the numbers. Consolidated quarterly revenues reached an all-time high of $848 million, and we closed the fiscal year with record revenues of $3.31 billion. CooperVision posted quarterly revenues of $562 million, up 11% organically and reached a new record high of $2.24 billion in fiscal year revenues. CooperSurgical posted record quarterly revenues of $286 million, up 15% organically and reached new record fiscal year revenues of $1.07 billion.\nFor the quarter, CooperVision's growth was led by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and myopia management products, while CooperSurgical's growth was broad-based with strength in PARAGARD fertility and our broader medical device portfolio. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.75. This was lower than we were forecasting primarily due to commercial spending tied to product launches and elevated distribution costs and Brian will cover this later in the call.\nFor CooperVision in Q4 and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, revenue growth was strong and diversified in all geographic regions and across all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals. The Americas grew 5%, EMEA was up 13% and Asia Pac reached 16%. This performance was driven by new product launches, expanded product ranges, market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings and growth in key accounts.\nRegarding product details, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 20% with especially strong growth from MyDay and from clariti in the Asia Pac region. Daily silicones continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio in the market with MyDay and clariti available on a broad range of spheres, torics and multifocals. Our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, reported another solid quarter of 6% growth.\nRegarding product launches, we remain extremely active. The MyDay multifocal launch is going incredibly well, and the feedback from customers and practitioners remains outstanding. In the meantime, the MyDay toric parameter expansion launch has been overwhelmingly positive in the U.S. and Canada. With over 4,000 SKUs, we now match our standard Biofinity toric range and have the widest daily toric range in the market by a wide margin.\nNot only does this expand the daily toric category for everyone but for many FRP toric wearers, this is their first opportunity to enjoy the freedom of a daily contact lens. We'll be rolling out these expanded parameters in additional markets as we move through fiscal 2023 and look forward to continued success.\nAnd lastly, on MyDay, we're excited to be bringing MyDay Energys to the market. This lens uses the same innovative technology as Biofinity Energys to alleviate digital eye strain, and eye care practitioners are excited to be getting this technology in a premium daily offering. We started seeding the U.S. market and a full national rollout is scheduled for early spring. Combining all this MyDay activity, truly exemplifies CooperVision's leadership in the daily silicone hydrogel space and our focus on offering practitioners a wide variety of market-leading technologically superior products.\nOutside of MyDay, demand for Biofinity remains especially strong to the point where we're somewhat capacity constrained. We've increased price and production, especially in the extremely high demand made-to-order extended range torics and toric multifocals, and we'll continue to focus on increasing capacity on a broader scale moving forward.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $26 million, up 29%, including MiSight up 88%. For the full fiscal year, we reported myopia management revenues of $93 million, which was impressive given the negative impact of currency and ongoing COVID restrictions in China. For MiSight, we're rolling out an expanded parameter range and launching in new countries and I'm happy to report that MiSight is now available in 41 countries.\nWithin this, we're seeing increased fitting activity from both independent optometrists and key accounts and we're continuing to see a positive halo effect with our MiSight customers accelerating their use of other CooperVision lenses. All this is a good sign and points to a strong fiscal 2023, where we expect myopia management revenue of $120 million to $130 million, up roughly 35% at the midpoint in constant currency.\nAnd as a reminder, MiSight contact lenses are the first and only FDA-approved soft contact lens proven to slow the progression of myopia in children aged 8 to 12 at the initiation of treatment. The product is backed by extensive clinical data and remains a shining example of CooperVision's leadership in the contact lens industry.\nMoving to SightGlass. We've been making progress with these myopia control glasses as part of our great joint venture with EssilorLuxottica. This includes selling in China and pilot programs in Canada, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Israel. In the U.S., the JV submitted an FDA application to be the first spectacle lens product to receive FDA approval for myopia control, and we hope to receive a positive response by calendar year-end.\nAnd to conclude on the importance of myopia management and why it needs to become standard of care, the risk of visual impairment and eye complications such as glaucoma grows exponentially with vision loss. So preventing higher levels of myopia is critically important for the long-term health of our children's eyes.\nTo finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market is performing exceptionally well with growth of roughly 9% in calendar Q3. There are still COVID-related challenges, especially with respect to staffing shortages in optometry offices negatively impacting patient flow, but progress is being made. Meanwhile, the long-term growth drivers of the industry remain intact. This starts with a macro growth trend and more people needing vision correction with an estimated 50% of the global population expected to have myopia or nearsightedness by 2050, up from roughly 34% of the population today.\nThis is driven by a variety of factors, including greater levels of screen time and less time outdoors, especially among children. Other industry drivers include the market's continuing shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing focus on higher-value products such as torics and multifocals and higher pricing, which is running ahead of historical trends. We expect global growth to remain healthy and believe we'll remain a leader with our robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading New Fit Data.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted a great quarter with growth throughout our portfolio. Fertility reported sales of $109 million, up 15% organically, its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, success we've seen throughout the product portfolio and around the world. And given our momentum as we enter fiscal 2023, we're continuing to invest in our team and in our fantastic product portfolio which includes leading consumables, capital equipment and genomics. Demand remains very strong, especially among our key accounts, so we need to keep building infrastructure, investing in our people and delivering the products and services required in this high-growth market.\nRegarding the overall fertility market, the future looks bright. There are several industry growth drivers, but one of the key factors being women delaying childbirth. The average age of a women's first birth in the U.S. and several other developed countries now stands at a record high of 30 years old and age is one of the key factors in meeting fertility assistance. Additionally, factors such as improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, improved product offerings such as cryopreservation, increasing fertility benefits coverage and technology improvements for both male and female infertility are driving the industry forward. In total, it's estimated that roughly 15% of reproductive age couples have fertility challenges and that over 750,000 babies are born annually through fertility assisted measures, and these numbers are growing.\nRegarding CooperSurgical's market positioning, we compete in a portion of the market that's roughly $2 billion in annual sales, and we forecast growth of 5% to 10% for many years to come. Within this, we're well positioned to continue delivering strong results with the broadest portfolio in the industry, a market-leading commercial footprint and strength in key accounts.\nMoving to office and surgical products, which includes OB/GYN medical devices, PARAGARD and stem cell storage. We posted sales of $178 million, up 58% and up 15% organically. Within this, PARAGARD grew 19% and office and surgical medical devices were up 13%. PARAGARD posted strong results rebounding from several tough quarters, and our OB/GYN medical devices benefited from strong demand, especially for surgical products combined with clearing some backlog. Lastly, our stem cell storage business grew 2%, in line with expectations against the difficult comp.\nTo conclude on CooperSurgical, we made a ton of progress this year. Our fertility business continues to post great results. Our office and surgical products closed the year strong, and we completed an incredible amount of integration activity associated with several acquisitions, including the Generate deal.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, let me say this was a great fiscal year for Cooper. We reported record revenues and made significant advancements throughout our organization. As we enter fiscal 2023, demand remains strong, supported by stable consumer activity and price increases, our investment activities, including new product launches and capacity expansion are going well. Our employees are highly engaged, and we're continuing to execute on our long-range strategic objectives. Having said that, we are aware of global inflation, geopolitical risks and other factors that could cause a global recession, and we're thus managing our investment activity with prudent cost controls and will continue to be vigilant in our operations.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $848 million, up 12% as reported and organically. Consolidated gross margin was 65%, down 250 basis points from last year, primarily due to currency and higher costs associated with supply chain challenges. Operating expenses grew 12% and were 42.8% of revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Generate. Consolidated operating margin was 22.2%, down from 24.9% last year, primarily due to currency.\nBefore moving on, let me say our Q4 operating income did not meet expectations. The primary drivers were commercial spending tied to product launches, an elevated distribution costs tied to shipping and inefficiencies associated with capacity expansion and automation efforts. Some of this activity will continue in fiscal 2023, and I'll touch on that in guidance.\nBelow -- moving below operating income. Interest expense was $23 million with higher rates and debt balances driving the increase. The effective tax rate was 14.2% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.75, with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding. Regarding earnings, FX negatively impacted the quarter by $0.75, which was $0.11 more than we had built into our guidance on our September earnings call. A large part of the $0.11 was attributable to the remeasurement of foreign currency-based intercompany trade receivables, including exposures from before we began mitigating certain balances. Free cash flow was $36 million, including CapEx of $95 million tied to capacity expansion and net debt reduced by $31 million to $2.61 billion.\nMoving to fiscal 2023 guidance. We are assuming a modest recession, ongoing inflation and rising interest rates. For the year, we're guiding to consolidated revenues of $3.455 billion to $3.515 billion, up 6% to 8% organically; with CooperVision revenues of $2.325 billion to $2.365 billion, up 7% to 9% organically; and CooperSurgical revenues of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, up 4% to 6% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.60 based on $106 million of interest expense and a 15% effective tax rate.\nFor interest, we're assuming a 50 basis point rate increase from the Fed in December, another 50 basis point increase in February and then an additional 25 basis point increase in March. For the tax rate, we're assuming no discrete items. For currency, we're using yesterday's rates with a little conservatism given the FX volatility. This results in year-over-year FX headwind of roughly 2.5% to revenues while being neutral to EPS. From a quarterly gating perspective, we expect consolidated Q1 revenues and earnings to be slightly less than Q4 with currency continuing to have a significant negative impact. After Q1, assuming rates hold steady, the currency impact will lessen and ultimately turn positive towards the middle of the fiscal year.\nMoving to the full year P&L. Let me touch on the details that will drive our financial results. During Q4, we ramped up investment activity and expect that to continue. As an example, we accelerated work on roughly doubling our U.S. CooperVision distribution center to get the building shell done before winter, and we now expect to be utilizing this additional 150,000 square feet of space this coming summer.\nWe are also expanding other distribution and manufacturing locations at CooperVision and CooperSurgical and implementing substantial automation. Additionally, we're adding significant capacity to our contact lens manufacturing footprint. We saw some of this activity in Q4 with CapEx of $95 million, and we expect this to continue with CapEx being around $400 million this fiscal year. Near-term demand is strong and long-term growth trends are very positive.\nSo this activity is needed to support our growth initiatives. Having done this type of expansion work in the past, we know we'll get it done and probably ahead of schedule, but it does create inefficiencies. When you're dealing with an already strained global supply chain, it makes things even more difficult. We built expectations around this inefficiency into our guidance, along with inflation assumptions and believe we've sufficiently captured everything. In total, for fiscal 2023, this means strong revenue growth, slightly improving gross margin supported by price increases and higher than normal OpEx, resulting in our operating margin being up slightly year-over-year.\nTo conclude on guidance, note that this does not include the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business, but does include the acquisition of SynergEyes, a small specialty contact lens business we closed on November 1. Regarding Cook, we're exploring options to get regulatory approval, including the potential sale of certain Cook assets and are hoping to close by June 30, 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Cooper Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Kim Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Risk Management. You may begin.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVP of IR & Risk Management, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Cooper Companies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, we will discuss the results and guidance included in the earnings release and then use the remaining time for questions.\nOur presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operation, the market or regulatory conditions or trends, product launches, operational initiatives, regulatory submissions and closing or integration of any acquisitions or their anticipated benefits.\nForward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, are set forth under the caption forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and are described in our SEC filings, including Cooper's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, all of which are available on our website at coopercos.com.\nAlso, as a reminder, the non-GAAP financial information we will provide on this call is provided as a supplement to our GAAP information. We encourage you to consider our results under GAAP as well as non-GAAP and refer to the reconciliations provided in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under quarterly results. Should you have any additional questions following the call, please e-mail ir@cooperco.com.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.\n\nAlbert G. White\n\nPresident, CEO & Non-Independent Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Company's third quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting that this was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth for CooperVision and the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue for CooperSurgical's fertility business. This impressive performance showcases the strength of our teams and the strong demand for our products and services. This momentum continued in August, and we're increasing the organic revenue guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, incorporating our strong Q3 and the strength we're continuing to see.\nOverall, the challenging macro environment, including headwinds from currency, inflation and supply chain challenges has negatively impacted profitability, but has not reduced our ability to take share and drive sustainable top line growth.\nMoving to the third quarter results. Consolidated revenues reached an all-time high of $843 million, with CooperVision posting record revenues of $566 million, up 11% organically and CooperSurgical posting record revenues of $277 million, up 35% as reported, up 3% organically.\nGrowth was led by our [Daily] Silicone hydrogel portfolio and myopia management products for CooperVision and fertility for CooperSurgical. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.19 and we posted record quarterly free cash flow of $217 million. For CooperVision and reporting all percentages on an organic basis, revenue growth was strong and diversified in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals and within all 3 geographic regions. The Americas was up 7%, EMEA grew 15% and Asia Pac grew 11%. This performance was driven by a number of factors, including new product launches, expanded product ranges market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings, growth in key accounts and strength of branded products.\nRegarding product details, daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 24%, led by great results from both MyDay and clariti. Daily silicones continue to be the main driver of growth for the contact lens industry, and we offer the broadest portfolio in the market with MyDay and clariti available on a broad range of spheres, torics and multifocals. Within this, we're continuing to see especially strong growth from MyDay, including from the very successful rollout of the MyDay multifocal which is taking share in markets around the world. The feedback from patients remains fantastic, and optometrists continue reporting that our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system is allowing them to fit the lens quickly and accurately. This success is driving a positive halo effect on MyDay spheres and torics, and we remain very optimistic about the future of this brand.\nClariti also posted a solid quarter with particular strength noted in Asia Pac. And our silicone hydrogel FRP lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, reported another solid quarter of 8% growth. Regarding product launches, we remain very active. I'm excited to announce, we'll be seeding the market with MyDay Energys over the next several months with a full launch scheduled for early calendar 2023. We've had a lot of requests for the Energys technology in a daily lens, and given the success we've had with Biofinity Energys. We're really excited about this opportunity. MyDay Energys will use the same digital zone optics technology as Biofinity Energys providing wearers greater comfort when using digital devices, along with enhanced end-of-day comfort. This daily lens is a perfect product for today's digital world and another great example of CooperVision leading with innovation and manufacturing know-how.\nAnd building on this, we'll also be launching an expanded MyDay toric parameter range in early fiscal 2023. MyDay already offers the most prescription options in the daily toric market, and this expansion will essentially match the leading offerings in the FRP toric segment, which will be a first for the contact lens industry. All this activity supports a fantastic MyDay brand and exemplifies CooperVision's focus on offering practitioners a wide variety of market-leading technologically superior products. Meanwhile, we're expanding availability of clariti around the world, which will further strengthen relationships with customers using store brands. And I'm also happy to report that we've recently increased production of Biofinity, including made-to-order extended range torics and Biofinity toric multifocals. Demand continues to exceed supply on these products, which has caused supply disruptions, so adding capacity is great news.\nOverall, these products and technologies improve how eye care professionals deliver clinical care, and it's allowing us to lead into finding standard of care, a core component of our ongoing share gains.\nMoving to myopia management. Another exciting area where we're a market leader. We posted revenues of $24 million, up 42%, including MiSight up 109%. Our growth trajectory remains strong with the main challenge being in China, where all contact lens sales, including MiSight and Ortho-K products have experienced difficulties due to ongoing COVID restrictions. Outside of China, MiSight is performing really well, backed by its extensive 7-year clinical data and FDA approval, and we're seeing strength with key accounts and private practitioners around the world. We're also seeing a positive halo effect with customers selling MiSight accelerating their use of other CooperVision lenses.\nFor SightGlass myopia management glasses, our JV relationship with EssilorLuxottica is going well, and the team continues to make progress. In the U.S., we're finalizing the submission of the 3-year clinical data and expect to submit it to the FDA in September. As a reminder, the only FDA-approved myopia management product on the market in the U.S. is MiSight, so obtaining approval for glasses has the potential to really propel the myopia management field forward.\nTo finish on CooperVision, the contact lens market continues to perform exceptionally well with estimated growth of 8% in calendar Q2. Although COVID-related challenges remain, including here in the U.S., where back-to-school eye exam demand is exceeding exam capacity, the many long-term growth drivers of the industry remain intact. This starts with a large macro growth trend that roughly 1/3 of the world is myopic today, and that is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. This is driving heightened screen time, among other factors.\nAdditionally, the shift to silicone hydrogel dailies remains strong, the penetration of higher-value products such as torics and multifocals is growing. The number of wearers is growing, and we're seeing price increases. We expect global growth to remain healthy and believe we'll remain a leader with our robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, fast-growing myopia management business and leading New Fit data.\nAnd speaking of data, I'm proud to say Counter Q2 U.S. stats showed CooperVision was the #1 company for new wearers and the only manufacturer to grow share in all 3 daily categories, spheres, torics and multifocals.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted a solid quarter led by fertility, which reported sales of $112 million, up 13% organically. As I mentioned earlier, this was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, so a big congratulations to that team. Success was seen throughout the product portfolio and around the world with particular strength noted in consumables with products like media, for pets, needles and catheters doing well. Consumables are a core part of our fertility business and an excellent indicator of future growth. So we remain in great shape to continue delivering strong results.\nRegarding the broader fertility market, the fundaments behind the industry's growth remained very healthy. There are many drivers, but women delaying childbirth is the primary factor as fertility challenges start increasing around the age of 30 with a more pronounced negative impact starting at 35. It's now estimated that roughly 15% of reproductive age couples worldwide have fertility challenges and over 750,000 babies are born annually through fertility assisted measures, and these numbers are growing.\nRegarding CooperSurgical's positioning, we estimate the portion of the market we compete in is roughly $2 billion in annual sales, and that it will grow in the 5% to 10% range for many years to come. In addition to increasing maternal age, other drivers include improving access to treatment, increasing patient awareness, growth in the number of fertility clinics, improved product offerings such as donor activity and cryopreservation services and technology improvements for both male and female and fertility challenges. Given the momentum of the industry and the diversity of factors driving growth, fertility is certainly an exciting market to be in.\nMoving to office and surgical products, which includes OB/GYN medical devices, PARAGARD and stem cell storage. We posted sales of $165 million, up 36%, but down 3% organically. OB/GYN medical device sales were negatively impacted by heightened back orders due to supply chain challenges. We've seen good demand and positive signs in our supply chain to start this quarter, so we expect healthy growth in fiscal Q4. PARAGARD is down 7% as expected due to a difficult comp with last year's price increase and related buying activity, but we expect nice growth in Q4 with an easier comp improving patient flow and an increasing patient focus on the most efficacious forms of birth control, including 99% effective IUDs such as PARAGARD.\nLastly, our stem cell storage business that we entered with the Generate acquisition this past December grew 1%. This was in line with expectations against the difficult comp from prior to our purchase of the business.\nTo wrap up on CooperSurgical, fertility remains strong. The other parts of the business are making progress, and the integration activity is going well. We expect a strong finish to this year and believe we're in an excellent position to deliver long-term mid-single-digit growth.\nTo conclude, we operate in recession-resistant industries with strong macro growth trends but we're not immune to supply chain challenges and currency is having a material impact on our as-reported results. Having said that, our core business fundamentals are excellent. We're taking market share. We're leveraging where we can, we're taking price. We'll remain extremely focused on the challenges facing us and will be proactive and we will proactively manage operations while maintaining a focus on delivering long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss financial results and guidance.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Third quarter consolidated revenues were $843 million, up 10% or up 9% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 66.1%, down 220 basis points from last year, driven primarily by currency. Operating expenses grew 13% and were 42.7% of revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Generate Life Sciences. Consolidated operating margin was 23.4%, within these results, currency is having a significant impact -- negative impact along with supply chain and inflationary pressures. We raised prices to offset some of this and have additional price increases coming, and we'll continue to work diligently controlling costs.\nMoving below the line, interest expense significantly increased year-over-year to $17 million, with higher rates and debt balances driving a large year-over-year increase. The effective tax rate was 10.2% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.19, with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding. Year-over-year FX negatively impacted earnings by $0.67 in the quarter, which was $0.10 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call.\nAs with last quarter, a large part of the $0.10 was attributable to the remeasurement of foreign currency-based intercompany trade receivables, which are recognized in other income and expense. In order to reduce this variability moving forward, we've made moves, including closing out certain nonfunctional exposures and improving our natural and synthetic hedge positions. Moving forward, we believe these efforts will do a better job mitigating the impact of FX gains or losses that occur below the operating income line.\nReturning to the quarter. Free cash flow was extremely strong at $217 million, and we decreased net debt by $218 million to $2.64 billion. This reduced leverage to 2.44x, which lowered the borrowing rate on our long-term credit facility pricing grid by 25 basis points. As a reminder, $1 billion of our debt is fixed to 2025 with the remaining amount floating.\nMoving to guidance. We are increasing the full year organic revenue growth ranges for CooperVision and CooperSurgical to include our strong Q3 results, and the strength we're seeing as we enter fiscal Q4. For EPS, we're updating guidance to reflect the negative impact of currency and interest rates, offset slightly by better operational performance.\nSpecific to fiscal Q4, the consolidated revenue guidance range is $830 million to $850 million, up 9% to 11% organically, with CooperVision revenues of $554 million to $565 million, up 8% to 10% organically, and CooperSurgical revenues of $276 million to $285 million, up 10% to 15% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 based on a roughly 13.5% effective tax rate and roughly $22 million of interest expense, which includes an assumption for a 75 basis point increase in September.\nRegarding currency, we're now forecasting the year-over-year negative impact in Q4 to be roughly 8% headwind to revenues and a 20% headwind to EPS. For fiscal 2023, we won't be providing detailed guidance, but let me provide some high-level direction. Assuming currency rates remain similar to where they are today, interest expense increases to around $85 million due to multiple rate hikes. Our effective tax rate increases to roughly 15%, and the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. We expect to report low single-digit year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth.\nThese expectations do not include the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business. Lastly, as it relates to our pending acquisition of Cook, that transaction is still pending regulatory approval. We are currently exploring different options to close the transaction, including the potential sale of certain Cook assets in the U.S. and abroad. Given the process and necessary approvals, the time line is tough to estimate, but we're hoping to close the transaction by June 30, 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to the Cooper Companies Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations and Risk Management. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVP of IR & Risk Management, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Cooper Companies Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

White\n\nPresident, CEO & Non-Independent Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting that our businesses are performing extremely well. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posted strong revenue growth, gained share and are continuing to see strong momentum. We're successfully managing through a variety of challenges from supply chain to COVID restrictions in China and we're maintaining our market-leading growth rates. So I'm really pleased with how the year is progressing. For the full year, we're increasing our organic revenue guidance for both businesses by incorporating our Q2 outperformance and the strength we're continuing to see.\nMoving to the quarter. Consolidated revenues reached an all-time high of $830 million, with CooperVision at $554 million, up 12% organically and CooperSurgical at $276 million, up 40% as reported or up 6% organically. The quarter was led by strength in CooperVision's daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and our myopia management products and CooperSurgical's fertility business, which posted another double-digit growth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.24, and Brian will provide the details, but this quarter was negatively impacted by FX in our contact lens solutions business.\nMoving to CooperVision and reporting all percentages on an organic basis. Our revenue growth was strong and diversified as we grew nicely in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals within all 3 geographic regions. The Americas were up 8%, EMEA grew 17% and Asia Pac grew 11%. This resulted in nice share gains, which is impressive following our strong Q1 performance. And for those of you tracking calendar quarters, our calendar Q1 organic growth rate was 16% against the market we estimate grew 12%. So strong numbers, and we remain well positioned to continue gaining share as we launch new products, expand product ranges, provide market-leading flexibility through our customized offerings, execute on key account relationships and deliver fantastic customer service.\nRegarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses posted very strong results, growing 28%. Daily silicones continue to lead the market, and we offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Our premium 1-day offering, MyDay, is available on a broad range of spheres, torics and multifocals. And while all these categories are performing well, it's worth highlighting the multifocal. The launch of the MyDay multifocal is still limited geographically, but it's rapidly taking share in markets where it's available, and we'll continue rolling it out as we progress through the year. The feedback from optometrists on our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system remains fantastic, and patients are continuing to say the lens is the best multifocal they've ever worn.\nThis success is also driving a nice halo effect on our already successful MyDay spheres and torics, so we remain very optimistic about the future of this brand. The other brand in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio is clariti, which is also available as a sphere, toric and multifocal and is typically sold into more of a mass market setting. This lens performed really well again this quarter, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we're continuing to roll out this year in Japan. Our silicone FRPs, Biofinity and Avaira reported another solid quarter of 8% growth. And lastly, as an umbrella comment about all these offerings, I'm happy to report that we're seeing an uptick in the growth rate of our branded product sales. As many of you are aware, we take a lot of pride in our customized offerings, which includes customer brands, but our own high-quality CooperVision brands are also showing strong growth, especially MyDay.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $23 million, up 61%, including MiSight up 144%. The specialty part of our business is extremely healthy, driven by growing traction in key accounts and continued strength with private practitioners. We have some challenges in China, where COVID restrictions are hurting our ortho-k sales and impacting our MiSight launch but the rest of the world is performing really well. MiSight, in particular, is excelling in all geographies as the ophthalmic community continues to embrace the growing myopia management segment of the market. And on another encouraging note, we're also seeing positive halo trends with our tracking data showing customers who are selling MiSight are accelerating their selling of our other lenses.\nMoving to SightGlass, myopia and management glasses. We closed our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica in March, and we're already seeing exciting progress, including additional availability of the product in additional markets such as China. Regarding an FDA approval, the 3-year clinical data for SightGlass is being compiled right now, and we look forward to receiving the data and sharing it with the FDA in the near future.\nSo in summary, we're seeing strong momentum in all areas of myopia management, and we expect to continue posting strong results. Before moving to market data, let me touch on our contact lens solutions business. Recent supply challenges have hit this operation hard, and we've experienced a significant decline in sales. Given this, we completed a strategic review and confirmed this is a nonstrategic business in a declining industry that's going to require a lot of capital to upgrade the facility. So we decided to exit the business by fiscal year-end. From a financial perspective, we expect this business to report roughly $20 million in revenues this year, down from $44 million last year. We are excluding these results from our organic growth rates to ensure transparency and comparability, and Brian will provide additional color on the rest of the P&L in a few minutes.\nTo wrap up on CooperVision, the contact lens market is performing exceptionally well, even in the face of continuing COVID challenges. Growth in daily silicones and an increasing prevalence of childhood myopia are offsetting the lower patient traffic tied to COVID. We expect global growth in the industry to remain strong as patient traffic continues to improve, and we look forward to what should be a strong back-to-school season this fall. Growth is also supported by the macro trends around vision correction, including that roughly 1/3 of the world is myopic today and that is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business, and our fit data remains very strong. So we remain very bullish on our future.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We posted another strong quarter led by double-digit growth in our fertility business. Our OB/GYN medical device portfolio also returned to growth, and our stem cell storage business posted a solid quarter. We did have some unexpected weakness in PARAGARD, but believe our performance track the broader IUD market, which hasn't rebounded as fast from COVID as other areas. Walking through each of these, let me start with fertility. Fertility posted sales of $114 million, up 15%. Strength was seen throughout our product portfolio of consumables, capital equipment, genomics and donor ag activity. Particular strength was seen from our RI Witness products, which comprise our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices along with strength from our AI-based genetic testing, which doctors used to select the best embryo transfer.\nMoving to our office and surgical category. We posted sales of $162 million, down 1%. Our OB/GYN medical devices grew 3%, which was strong given this is the area where we were most impacted by global supply chain challenges. Particular strength in this business unit was seen within our labor and delivery portfolio and laparoscopic closure products. Moving to our stem cell storage business that we entered with the Generate acquisition, sales grew 5%. There is a ton of activity right now integrating this business into CooperSurgical, and it's going well. The teams are seeing early success on commercial synergies, and they have some exciting ideas to drive additional growth synergies. So I remain bullish on our future in this space.\nLastly, on PARAGARD. Sales were down 6% for the quarter, and we're continuing to see softness in the market. This certainly doesn't appear to be product-specific as the entire IUD marketplace has remained under pressure with lower volumes driven by lower patient flow and what we believe is a temporary shift in buying behavior to birth control pills with telemedicine. We're closely monitoring the market and we remain cautiously optimistic we'll see a return to pre-COVID levels as we move towards the end of the year.\nTo wrap up on CooperSurgical, let me highlight a few key takeaways. First, we're seeing success from our Generate acquisition, both on the fertility and stem cell storage parts of the business. There are a lot of commercial synergies that we're capitalizing on, and this acquisition is certainly looking like a success right now. Second, our fertility business continues to perform extremely well. This is a solid growth industry with strong macro trends, and we continue forecasting long-term market growth of 5% to 10% with us in the upper part of that range. Lastly, our team has completed 6 acquisitions since the beginning of last fiscal year, and they've maintained market-leading customer service and strong sales even while integrating these businesses and managing through significant supply chain and logistics challenges, so impressive performance.\nTo conclude, we operate in recession-resistant industries with strong macro growth trends. Additionally, significant amounts of our sales are annuity in nature. So we need to be resilient in times like this, investing intelligently to capitalize on growth opportunities while ensuring we're advancing our infrastructure projects to support our growth. We'll remain sensitive to the challenges facing us and be proactive managing our businesses, maintaining a focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. This includes continuing to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We just released our second ESG report, which highlights progress in several important areas, and you can find this report on our Investor Relations page. And lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank our fantastic employees. It's their hard work and dedication that drives our success and makes Cooper such a special place to work. So a big thank you to all Cooper employees.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.\nSecond quarter consolidated revenues were $830 million, up 15% or up 10% organically. Consolidated gross margin was 66.7% down 140 basis points from last year, driven primarily by currency. Operating expenses grew 18% and were 42.2% of revenues, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Generate Life Sciences and higher R&D investments. Consolidated operating margin was 24.5%. Within this, we did see challenges from supply chain and inflationary pressures, but our teams did a nice job managing costs and price increases and continuing efficiency improvement initiatives, such as the consolidation of CooperSurgical's production into Costa Rica helped offset the impact.\nInterest expense was $10.8 million, and our effective tax rate was 13.7%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. Year-over-year FX negatively impacted earnings by $0.53 in the quarter, which was $0.15 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call. One point to mention is that a large portion of the quarterly FX loss was from the remeasurement impact of yen and euro-based intercompany trade receivables. These remeasurements happen every quarter, and the net amount is usually relatively small. However, significant currency moves towards the end of the quarter resulted in a larger loss in other income and expense.\nThe other unusual item from this quarter was the operating loss from our contact lens solutions business of roughly $0.05. To add some color to what Al mentioned earlier, this has not been a profitable business for us this year. We had a recall in Q1, which resulted in low sales and an operating loss. We expected the business to rebound in Q2, but continuing supply chain challenges prevented that. And Q2 sales were only $4.4 million with a roughly $2.7 million operating loss. From a non-GAAP perspective, we recognized and excluded many costs from the shutdown decision this quarter. But the business remains operational, so activity remains in our non-GAAP P&L and will remain so until we exit the business at fiscal year-end.\nReturning to the quarter. Free cash flow was $88 million. Net debt decreased $125 million to $2.86 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio reduced to 2.59x. Net debt decreased by more than free cash flow due to the positive impact from closing the SightGlass Vision joint venture.\nMoving to guidance. We're increasing our revenue growth ranges for CooperVision and CooperSurgical to include our Q2 results and the strength we're continuing to see in our markets, offset mostly by the impact of currency. For EPS, we're updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of currency and interest rates but holding it unchanged outside of that. Outside of that, there are a number of moving parts, but ultimately positives such as higher revenues, efficiency efforts, and a lower effective tax rate are offsetting supply chain inflationary pressures and the negative impact of the solutions shutdown. This all results in a consolidated revenue guidance range of $3.280 billion to $3.312 billion, up 9% to 10% organically with CooperVision revenues of $2.225 billion to $2.247 billion, up 10% to 11% organically and CooperSurgical revenues of $1.055 billion to $1.065 billion, up 6% to 7% organically.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $13.09 to $13.29. For interest expense, we're assuming a 50 basis point increase in both June and July and a 25 basis point rate increase in September. Regarding currency, the year-over-year impact from FX is now a roughly 5% headwind to revenues and a 14% headwind to EPS. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance with a number of moving parts, let me add that we expect Q3 earnings to be similar to Q2 driven by the significant negative impact of currency for the quarter. We also forecast a large increase in interest expense in Q3, but expect that to be offset by a lower tax rate. For Q4, we expect a rebound in EPS, led by a lower pound flowing through our cost of goods, helping CooperVision's gross margin.\nAnd note, this guidance does not include our pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business. That transaction is still pending regulatory approval, and we'll update you once we're closer to completing that process.\nAnd with that, I will hand it back to the operator for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Kim Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Risk Management.\n\nKim Duncan\n\nVP of IR & Risk Management, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

White\n\nPresident, CEO & Non-Independent Director, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies' Fiscal First Quarter Conference Call. Before I turn to our business, let me say the escalation of the devastating crisis in Ukraine is top of mind. The event caused great concern for everyone in that region, including our employees, partners and their families. Our thoughts are with everyone who is being affected, and we certainly hope peace prevails soon.\nMoving to our business. I'm pleased to report a strong start to the fiscal year, led by a fantastic quarter at CooperVision and another solid quarter at CooperSurgical. Within vision, our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios continued posting strong results, leading to share gains around the world. Within surgical, our fertility business posted great numbers and the integration of Generate Life Sciences is going really well with that business off to a fast start as part of Cooper. We also recently announced the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business, which will be a great addition to our surgical franchise.\nRegarding first quarter financial results, consolidated revenues were $787 million, with CooperVision at $561 million, up 11%; and CooperSurgical reaching a new all-time high of $226 million, up 30%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.24.\nMoving to the details and reporting all percentages on an organic basis. Our CooperVision growth of 14% was strong and diversified. We grew nicely in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals, and all 3 regions posted great results, with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 17% and Asia Pac up 19%. This resulted in nice share gains, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the reopening of economies around the world as COVID subsides.\nAll of this is driven by our multifaceted commercial strategy that we began deploying years ago, which has proven to be extremely successful. This includes a consistent cadence of launching new products and product extensions around the world, providing customers with market-leading flexibility through our customized solutions, executing on key account relationships and delivering fantastic customer service. We're continuing these efforts while also enhancing our business through sales force expansions and targeted marketing and infrastructure investments.\nRegarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti, posted strong results, growing 25%. Daily silicones continue to lead the market, and we offer the broadest portfolio of products to meet customers' needs. This includes MyDay, our premium offering, which is available in a sphere, toric and, most recently, a multifocal. And speaking of the multifocal, the launch is going incredibly well.\nThe feedback from eye care practitioners regarding use of our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system that simplifies the fit process while providing optimal visual acuity at all levels has been fantastic. And we're continuing to receive feedback from patients that MyDay provides the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near, intermediate and distant vision. This success is having a nice halo effect on our already successful MyDay torics and spheres, so we remain very optimistic about this brand.\nThe other brand in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio is clariti. This lens is also available as a sphere, toric and multifocal and is sold as more of a mass market product. We've seen nice growth with this brand, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we just posted an extremely strong quarter.\nFor our FRPs, we reported another solid quarter of 10% growth for Avaira and Biofinity, our silicone hydrogel 2-week and monthly lenses. This was led by improved product availability and our unique offerings such as Biofinity toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space.\nTo finish on products, we're continuing to see nice strength in torics and multifocals as we expand parameter ranges and increase availability around the world. When you combine this with the success we're having in key accounts, it's resulting in nice share gains, and we expect that to continue.\nMoving to myopia management. We posted revenues of $20 million. And within this, MiSight grew 172%. This growth rate was an acceleration from Q4, which is impressive, given the general market challenges around new fits. Overall, as a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses.\nFor MiSight, we're continuing to make progress around the world, including in China, where we're preparing for a broader launch with our partner, Essilor. Our team in China is strong, and our advisory board of key opinion leaders that are affiliated with hospitals representing over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China has us positioned for success in a market where childhood myopia rates are estimated to be over 80%, and we're reducing myopia as a priority for the government.\nLastly, on MiSight, our industry-leading 7-year clinical data has been getting a lot of exposure as it highlights that MiSight works for nearly all myopic children. It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average. It works at any age a child starts treatment. It works for as long as the child wears it. And there's no rebound if treatment is stopped.\nMoving to SightGlass myopia management glasses. Following our co-launch in the Netherlands with Essilor in November, we started early launches in additional markets, including the U.K. and Canada. Within Canada, we've launched the product under the MiSight name, which is an exciting step in combining our myopia management glasses and contact lenses under one brand name. We've also accelerated activity in China and plan to launch the product later this fiscal year.\nTo conclude on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting roughly $100 million in sales for this fiscal year.\nTo wrap up on CooperVision, for calendar Q4, we estimate the global contact lens market grew 10%, with CooperVision growing 16%. Within this, COVID-related challenges did negatively impact optometry offices around the world, and combining this with heightened patient demand as myopia rates continue to rise is resulting in many eye care offices having full calendars of appointments.\nThis demand is great, but it's still impacting fit activities such as in the U.S. where new fits are still roughly 8% below pre-COVID levels. Having said that, progress is being made, and we expect to continue seeing positive trends as COVID subsides and economies around the world reopen with people returning to the office and becoming more active in social settings.\nMeanwhile, long-term macro growth trends remain intact with roughly 1/3 of the world being myopic today and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and our fit data remains strong. So we remain very bullish on our business.\nMoving to CooperSurgical. We're extremely busy integrating Generate, which we just closed in mid-December. In the meantime, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 9%.\nBefore getting into the details, let's cover Generate. We recognized roughly $34 million of revenues in the quarter as this was a stub period with only roughly 1.5 months of revenue. Of this, $23 million was in stem cell storage and $11 million in fertility. It's tough to get exact growth rates for a stub period, but growth for the business for the full equivalent fiscal quarter was 10%.\nMoving to our fertility business. We posted sales of $97 million, up a very healthy 27% when excluding Generate and the small acquisition of Embryo Options from last January. Strength was seen on a global basis and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics.\nWithin our office and surgical unit, we posted sales of $129 million, up 24% as reported, but down 3% when excluding Generate and other acquisitions. This was due to the negative impact of COVID on sales of PARAGARD as well as certain surgical products. Having said that, we did see growth in many areas such as our laparoscopic surgery closure products, and our acquired businesses grew nicely, especially Fetal Pillow in our labor and delivery area, which grew 160%. Based on current trends, we expect office and surgical sales to improve and show organic growth in Q2.\nTo wrap up on CooperSurgical, let me touch on some market information. For fertility, we're largely back to pre-COVID levels. Some markets like the U.S. are stronger, while others outside the U.S. are still dealing with COVID-related challenges. But net-net, the market is in a good place.\nThis industry continues to grow nicely, and we estimate our addressable market is approaching $2 billion with 5% to 10% long-term annual growth. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors such as increasing maternal age and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility.\nGiven the improving access to treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, we expect this industry to grow nicely for many years to come. Within office and surgical, as mentioned earlier, we expect growth to return in Q2 as the market fundamentals are improving.\nTo summarize, this was a really strong start to our fiscal year. CooperVision posted a great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success with the best team in the industry and the broadest product portfolio in the market. Our fertility business is growing nicely and taking share, and the Generate business is integrating really well with some exciting potential as we incorporate stem cell storage into our labor and delivery product portfolio.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian G. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, The Cooper Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.\nFirst quarter consolidated revenues were $787 million, up 16% and up 13% organically. Consolidated gross margin decreased year-over-year by 90 basis points to 66.9%, driven primarily by currency, but also lower sales of PARAGARD, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.\nOperating expenses grew 19% to 42.3% of revenues with the addition of Generate and higher investment activity. Consolidated operating margins were 24.6%, down from 26.9% last year due to the negative impact of FX and higher investing. In addition, we did see higher freight, secondary handling and distribution costs within cost of goods and OpEx and expect this to continue, although price increases are helping to offset the impact. Interest expense was $6.6 million on higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. The effective tax rate was 13.3%, higher primarily due to the Generate acquisition.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $3.24 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. FX negatively impacted us by $0.37 in the quarter, which was $0.02 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call. Free cash flow was solid at $109 million, comprised of $166 million of operating cash flow, offset by $57 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased by $1.6 billion to $3 billion, driven by the acquisition of Generate. And our adjusted leverage ratio increased to 2.71x.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased roughly 191,200 shares of the company's common stock for $78.5 million at an average purchase price of $410.41 per share, that's $410.41. Roughly $256 million remains authorized for repurchase under our program.\nMoving to guidance. We've updated our numbers to reflect our outperformance in Q1, the addition of Generate, new currency rates and the assumption of a 25 basis point rate increase by the Fed next week. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this would have meant the midpoint for EPS would have been roughly $14.35, but currency has moved significantly against us over the past week. We're increasing prices to offset the negative impact, and hopefully, the currency moves are temporary, but we're taking a conservative approach and fully incorporating negative currency into our guidance, noting that the scope, degree and duration of the crisis on the global economy is an evolving risk.\nWith this, the new consolidated revenue range is $3.261 billion to $3.329 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% organically. Within this, CooperVision revenue guidance is $2.221 billion to $2.264 billion, up 7% to 9% organically. CooperSurgical revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.065 billion, up 35% to 38% as reported or 5% to 7% organically. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $13.70 to $14.20.\nWe estimate interest expense around $42 million, which assumes a 25 basis point rate increase, remembering that $1 billion of our debt is fixed -- is at fixed rates. We estimate the full year tax rate to be around 14%. Regarding currency, on a year-over-year basis, the negative FX headwind is now roughly 3.5% to revenues and roughly 10% negative impact to EPS.\nNote this guidance does not include our pending Cook Medical reproductive health acquisition as the transaction has not yet closed. Regarding Cook, we announced this acquisition on February 7 for $875 million. This is a really nice strategic fit as they manufacture and sell minimally invasive medical devices focused on their fertility and gynecology markets. With this acquisition, we'll be improving our international fertility footprint, especially within the Asia Pac region and will be adding highly synergistic and respected labor and delivery medical devices.\nFrom a financial perspective, this business had roughly $158 million in sales in calendar 2021, and we expect long-term growth in the range of 5% to 9%. Additionally, we expect year 1 non-GAAP EPS accretion of roughly $0.60. For more information, please visit our IR website, where there is a presentation.\nIn summary, we're pleased with this quarter's performance and believe our momentum will continue, driven by strategic investments in both businesses that will support share gains and durable long-term revenue and earnings growth. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.",
